In 1880, in Big Whiskey, [[Wyoming Territory|Wyoming]], a cowboy named Quick Mike slashes prostitute Delilah Fitzgerald's face with a knife, permanently disfiguring her after she laughs at his small penis. As punishment, [[sheriff]] ""Little Bill"" Daggett orders Mike and his associate who was with him at the brothel, Davey Bunting, to turn over several of their horses to Delilah's employer, Skinny DuBois, for his loss of revenue. Outraged, the prostitutes offer a $1,000 [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] for the cowboys' deaths.

In [[Hodgeman County]], [[Kansas]], a boastful young man visits Will Munny's hog farm. He calls himself the ""Schofield Kid"" and claims to be an experienced bounty hunter looking for help pursuing the cowboys. Formerly a notorious outlaw and murderer, Will is now a repentant widower raising two children. After initially refusing to help, Will realizes that his farm is failing and his children's future is in jeopardy. He recruits his friend Ned Logan, another retired outlaw, and they catch up with the Kid, who, they discover, is severely [[near-sighted]].

Back in Big Whiskey, British-born [[gunfighter]] ""English"" Bob, an old acquaintance and rival of Little Bill, seeks the bounty. He arrives in town with his biographer W. W. Beauchamp, who naively believes Bob's tall tales. Enforcing the town's anti-gun law, Little Bill, with his deputies, disarms Bob and beats him savagely to discourage others from attempting to claim the bounty. Bob, humiliated, is banished from town the next morning, but Beauchamp stays out of a fascination with the Sheriff, who debunks many of the romantic notions Beauchamp has about the [[Wild West]]. Little Bill explains to Beauchamp that the best attribute for a gunslinger is to be cool-headed under fire rather than to have the quickest draw, and to always kill the best shooter first.

Will, Ned, and the Kid arrive in town during a rainstorm and enter Skinny's saloon. While Ned and the Kid meet with the prostitutes upstairs, Little Bill confronts a feverish Will. Not realizing Will's identity but correctly guessing that he wants the bounty, Bill confiscates his [[pistol]] and beats him. Ned and the Kid escape through a back window and take Will to an unoccupied barn outside of town, where they and the prostitutes nurse him back to health. A few days later, the trio ambush Davey. After missing Davey and shooting his horse, Ned falters and Will shoots Davey instead. Ned decides to quit and return to Kansas.

Ned is later captured and flogged to death by Little Bill to learn the whereabouts of Will and the Kid. Will takes the Kid with him to the cowboys' ranch, directing him to ambush Quick Mike in the [[outhouse]] and shoot him. After they escape, a distraught Kid drunkenly confesses he had never killed anyone before and is overcome with remorse. A prostitute arrives with the reward and tells them about Ned's fate. Shocked by the news, Will begins drinking and demands the Kid's [[Schofield revolver|revolver]]. The Kid hands it over, saying that he no longer wants to be a killer, and Will sends him back to Kansas to distribute the reward.

That night, Will finds Ned's corpse displayed in a coffin outside Skinny's saloon. Inside, Little Bill and his deputies are organizing a [[Posse comitatus|posse]]. Will walks in alone, brandishing a shotgun, and kills Skinny for displaying Ned's corpse. He then aims at Little Bill, but the shotgun misfires. In the ensuing gunfight, Will shoots Little Bill and several other men with the revolver. He then orders the rest of the posse out. Beauchamp lingers briefly to ask how Will survived. Will replies that it was luck and scares him away. Little Bill tries and fails to take another shot while lying on the floor, then bemoans his fate and curses Will, who shoots him dead. Will shouts threats as he mounts his horse and rides out of town.

A closing title card states that Will's mother-in-law found his farm abandoned years later, Will having possibly moved to San Francisco with the children, and she remained at a loss to understand why her daughter married such a notorious outlaw and murderer.","Drama, Western","starring       = {{Plainlist|

In 1912, [[Scouts BSA|Boy Scout]] [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]] lives with his father [[Henry Jones Sr.]] in [[Moab, Utah]]. One day, while undergoing a cave exploration, Indy takes a [[crucifix]] owned by [[Francisco Vázquez de Coronado|Coronado]] from a group of graverobbers led by a man named Garth, and after a brief horse chase, flees to his home, where Garth and his men find him and retrieve the crucifix. Garth, however, admits his respect towards Indiana and gives him his [[fedora]] before leaving.

In 1938, Indy successfully takes back the crucifix from the [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Panama Hat|employer of the graverobbers]] off the Portuguese coast. After returning to the United States, Indy learns Henry has disappeared while searching for the [[Holy Grail]]. [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Walter Donovan|Walter Donovan]], his father's financial backer, tasks Indy with finding both Henry and the Grail. Indy receives a package containing Henry's diary, which includes his research on the Grail, and travels to [[Venice]] alongside [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Marcus Brody|Marcus Brody]] to meet Henry's associate [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Elsa Schneider|Elsa Schneider]]. Beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indy and Elsa discover a [[Catacombs|catacomb]] containing an inscribed shield which reveals that the path to the Grail begins in [[İskenderun|Alexandretta]]. The two are subsequently attacked by a mysterious group who reveal themselves to be the secret Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, dedicated to protecting the Grail. After saving the group's leader Kazim, Indy learns that Henry is being held at a castle in [[Austria within Nazi Germany|Austria]]. Indy entrusts Marcus with a map from the diary detailing a route to the Grail and sends him to [[Alexandretta]] to rendezvous with their old friend [[Sallah]]. Discovering their rooms have been ransacked, Indy reveals the diary's existence to Elsa before they sleep together.

In Austria, Indy and Elsa infiltrate the castle, discovering it to be under [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] control. Indy finds Henry and tries to escape, but surrenders after Elsa is held captive by the Nazis. She reveals herself to be a Nazi collaborator and takes the diary, and Indy and Henry are tied up and learn that Donovan is also working with the Nazis. After arriving in Alexandretta, Marcus is captured by the Nazis as well. Elsa returns to Germany, while Indy and Henry escape the castle before traveling to [[Berlin]] to retrieve the diary. After recovering it from Elsa, Indy and Henry flee on a [[zeppelin]] before evading two ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' planes pursuing them.

Once Indy and Henry arrive in [[Hatay State|Hatay]], Sallah informs them that the Nazis have also traveled there using the map. While they are following the trail, the Nazis are attacked by the Brotherhood but defeat them. Henry takes advantage of the distraction to try to rescue Marcus but is captured; Indy attacks the Nazi convoy in response and is eventually able to destroy it with help from Henry and Marcus. Indy, Henry, Marcus and Sallah proceed to a temple containing the Grail, where they observe the Nazis attempting to overcome the temple's traps before being captured. Donovan forces Indy to find safe passage for them by mortally wounding Henry; a drink from the Grail can heal him. With the help of the diary, Indy overcomes the traps and finds a room with many cups and an [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Grail Knight|ancient knight]], who explains that only one cup is the true Grail. Donovan and Elsa enter the room, and Elsa deliberately gives him the wrong cup, killing Donovan after he drinks from it. Indy identifies the true Grail and rescues Henry. Elsa falls to her death when her attempt to leave with the Grail causes the temple to collapse, and Indy nearly suffers the same fate before Henry saves him. 

The Grail falls into an abyss as Indy and his companions escape and ride off into the sunset.","Action, Adventure","starring       = {{Plainlist|

On Christmas Eve, [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) Detective [[John McClane]] arrives in Los Angeles, hoping to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly, at a party held by her employer, the Nakatomi Corporation. He is driven to Nakatomi Plaza by a limo driver, Argyle, who offers to wait for McClane in the garage. While McClane washes himself, the tower is seized by the German radical [[Hans Gruber]] and his heavily armed team, including Karl and Theo. Everyone in the tower is taken hostage except for McClane, who slips away, and Argyle, who remains oblivious to events.

Gruber is posing as a terrorist to steal the $640 million in untraceable [[bearer bond]]s in the building's vault.{{efn|The $640{{nbsp}}million in the vault is equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US-GDP|640000000|1988}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}.}} He kills executive Joseph Takagi after failing to extract the access code from him and tasks Theo with breaking into the vault. The terrorists are alerted to McClane's presence, and Karl's brother, Tony, is sent after him. McClane kills Tony and takes his weapon and radio, which he uses to contact the skeptical [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD). Sergeant [[Al Powell]] is sent to investigate. Meanwhile, McClane kills more terrorists and recovers their bag of [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] and detonators. Realizing Powell is about to leave, having found nothing amiss, McClane drops a terrorist's corpse onto his car. After Powell calls for backup, a [[SWAT]] team attempts to storm the building but is counterattacked by the terrorists. McClane throws some C-4 down an elevator shaft, causing an explosion that kills some of the terrorists and ends the counterattack.

Holly's co-worker Harry Ellis attempts to negotiate on Gruber's behalf but is killed by Gruber when McClane refuses to surrender. While checking the explosives on the roof, Gruber encounters McClane and pretends to be an escaped hostage; McClane gives Gruber a gun. Gruber attempts to shoot McClane but finds the weapon is unloaded, and he is saved only by the intervention of other terrorists. McClane escapes but is injured by shattered glass and loses the detonators. Outside, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) agents take control. They order the power to be shut off, which, as Gruber had anticipated, disables the final vault lock so his team can collect the bonds.

The FBI agrees to Gruber's demand for a helicopter, intending to send helicopter gunships to eliminate the group. McClane realizes Gruber plans to blow the roof to kill the hostages and fake his team's deaths. Karl, enraged by Tony's death, attacks McClane and is seemingly killed. Gruber sees a news report by Richard Thornburg on McClane's children and deduces that he is Holly's husband. The hostages are taken to the roof while Gruber keeps Holly with him. McClane drives the hostages from the roof just before Gruber detonates it and destroys the approaching FBI helicopters. Meanwhile, Theo retrieves an escape vehicle from the parking garage but is knocked out by Argyle, who has been following events on the limo's [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]].

A weary and battered McClane finds Holly with Gruber and his remaining henchman. McClane surrenders to Gruber and is about to be shot but grabs his concealed service pistol taped to his back and uses his last two bullets to wound Gruber and kill his accomplice. Gruber crashes through a window but grabs onto Holly's wristwatch and makes a last-ditch attempt to kill the pair. McClane unclasps the watch, and Gruber falls to his death. Outside, Karl ambushes McClane and Holly but is shot dead by Powell. Holly punches Thornburg when he attempts to interview McClane. Argyle crashes through the parking garage door in the limo and drives McClane and Holly away together.","Action, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist|

In 1941, [[Jake LaMotta]] is a young, up-and-coming [[middleweight]] boxer who suffers his first loss to [[Jimmy Reeves]] after a controversial decision. Jake's brother [[Joey LaMotta|Joey]] discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] connections, Salvy Batts, but he repeatedly refuses the Mafia's help, wanting to win the championship on his own terms. Some time after, Jake spots a fifteen-year-old girl named Vickie at a swimming pool in his [[Bronx]] neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, although he is already married and Vickie is underage. In 1943, Jake defeats [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite Jake dominating Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson, who Joey feels won only because he was enlisting into the [[United States Army|Army]] the following week. By 1945, Jake marries Vickie.

Jake is controlling and domineering over Vickie, and constantly worries that she has feelings for other men. His jealousy is evident when he brutally beats his next opponent, [[Tony Janiro]], in front of Tommy Como, the local [[mob boss]], and Vickie. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]], he is distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vickie, who implies she is dissatisfied in her marriage with Jake. Under the wrong impression that Vickie is having an affair with Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a [[Match fixing|dive]] first. Jake purposely loses his next match against [[Billy Fox (boxer)|Billy Fox]], and is booed out of the building after putting up a lackluster performance. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, much to his anguish. He is eventually reinstated, and in 1949, wins the middleweight championship title against [[Marcel Cerdan]].

A year later, Jake becomes increasingly paranoid that Vickie is having an affair. He asks Joey if he has had an affair with her, enraging Joey and causing him to leave. Jake later presses Vickie about whether she has had an affair, leading to her sarcastically confessing that she had sex with Joey, Salvy and Tommy. In a fit of rage, Jake, followed by Vickie, walks to Joey's house and assaults him in front of his wife Lenora and their children before knocking Vickie unconscious. Vickie later returns to their home and threatens to leave, but they reconcile. After defending his championship belt in a grueling fifteen-round bout against [[Laurent Dauthuille]] in 1950, he calls his brother after the fight to make amends, but when Joey assumes Salvy is on the other end and starts insulting and cursing at him, Jake silently hangs up. Estranged from his brother, Jake sees his career decline and he eventually loses his title to Sugar Ray Robinson in their [[Sugar Ray Robinson vs. Jake LaMotta|final encounter in 1951]].

By 1956, an aged and overweight Jake has retired and moved with his family to [[Miami]]. After he stays out all night at the nightclub which he owns, Vickie tells him she wants a divorce as well as full custody of their children. She also threatens to call the police if he comes anywhere near them. He is later arrested for introducing under-age girls to men in his club. He unsuccessfully attempts to bribe his way out of his criminal case using the jewels from his championship belt. In 1957, he goes to jail, sorrowfully questioning his misfortune and crying in despair. Upon returning to New York City in 1958, he encounters Joey, who reluctantly accepts his embrace.

In 1964, Jake performs [[stand-up comedy]] at various clubs.

'''''Raging Bull''''' is a 1980 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Sports film|sports]]  [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Martin Scorsese]] and starring [[Robert De Niro]], [[Joe Pesci]], [[Cathy Moriarty]], [[Theresa Saldana]], [[Frank Vincent]], and [[Nicholas Colasanto]] in his final film role. The film is an adaptation of former [[middleweight]] boxing champion [[Jake LaMotta]]'s 1970 memoir ''[[Raging Bull: My Story]]''. It follows the career of LaMotta, played by De Niro, his rise and fall in the boxing scene, and his turbulent personal life beset by rage and jealousy.

Scorsese was initially reluctant to develop the project, though he eventually came to relate to LaMotta's story. [[Paul Schrader]] re-wrote [[Mardik Martin]]'s first screenplay, and Scorsese and De Niro together made uncredited contributions thereafter. Pesci was an unknown actor prior to the film, as was Moriarty, whom Pesci suggested for her role. During [[principal photography]], each of the boxing scenes was choreographed for a specific visual style and De Niro gained approximately {{convert|60|lb|kg}} to portray LaMotta in his later post-boxing years. Scorsese was exacting in the process of [[Post-production|editing and mixing]] the film, expecting it to be his last major feature.

''Raging Bull'' premiered in New York City on November 14, 1980, and was released in theaters on December 19, 1980. The film had a lukewarm box office of $23.4&nbsp;million against its $18&nbsp;million budget. The film received mixed reviews upon its release; while De Niro's performance and the editing were widely acclaimed, it garnered criticism due to its violent content. Despite the mixed reviews, the film was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]] at the [[53rd Academy Awards]] (tying with ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' as the most nominated film of the ceremony), including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and won two: [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for De Niro (his second Oscar) and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Editing]].

After its release, ''Raging Bull'' went on to garner high critical praise, and is now considered one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]]. In 1990, it became the first film to be selected in its first year of eligibility for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"",<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-08|archive-date=October 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031213743/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last1=Gamarekian|first1=Barbara|date=1990-10-19|title=Library of Congress Adds 25 Titles to National Film Registry|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/19/movies/library-of-congress-adds-25-titles-to-national-film-registry.html|access-date=2020-05-08|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=October 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201004011545/https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/19/movies/library-of-congress-adds-25-titles-to-national-film-registry.html/|url-status=live}}</ref> and the [[American Film Institute]] ranked it as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|fourth-greatest American movie of all time]].

== Production ==

=== Development ===
''Raging Bull'' came about when [[Robert De Niro]] read the [[Raging Bull: My Story|autobiography upon which the film is based]] while he was on the set of ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Although disappointed by the book's writing style, De Niro became fascinated by the character of [[Jake LaMotta]]. He showed the book to [[Martin Scorsese]] on the set of ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' in the hope that he would consider the project.<ref name=""Biskind p254"">Biskind, Peter, ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'', 1999, p. 254.</ref> Scorsese repeatedly turned down the opportunity to direct the film, claiming he had no idea what ''Raging Bull'' was about, even though he had read some of the text. Never a sports fan, when he found out what LaMotta used to do for a living, he said, ""A boxer? I don't like boxing...Even as a kid, I always thought that boxing was boring... It was something I couldn't, wouldn't grasp."" His overall opinion of sport in general is, ""Anything with a ball, no good.""<ref name=""Biskind p378"">Biskind, Peter ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'' 1998, p. 378.</ref> The book was then passed onto Mardik Martin, the film's eventual co-screenwriter, who said ""the trouble is the damn thing has been done a hundred times before—a fighter who has trouble with his brother and his wife and the mob is after him"". De Niro had even shown the book to producers [[Robert Chartoff]] and [[Irwin Winkler]], who were willing to assist only if Scorsese agreed.<ref name=""Biskind p315"">Biskind, Peter, ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'', 1998, p. 315.</ref> After nearly dying from a [[drug overdose]], Scorsese agreed to make the film, not only to save his own life but also to save his career. Scorsese began to relate very personally to the story of Jake LaMotta, and in it he saw how the boxing ring can be ""an allegory for whatever you do in life"", which for him paralleled moviemaking, ""you make movies, you're in the ring each time.""<ref name=""Thompson pp.76/77"">Thompson, David and Christie, Ian, ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', pp.&nbsp;76/77.</ref><ref name=""Friedman p115"">Friedman Lawrence S.

Preparation for the film began with Scorsese shooting some 8&nbsp;mm color footage featuring De Niro boxing in a ring. One night when the footage was being shown to De Niro, [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], and his friend and mentor, the British director [[Michael Powell]], Powell pointed out that the color of the gloves at the time would have only been maroon, oxblood, or even black. This is one of the reasons Scorsese chose to film ''Raging Bull'' in black and white. Other reasons were to distinguish the film from other color films around the time and to acknowledge the problem of fading color film stock—an issue Scorsese recognized.<ref name=""Biskind p389"">Biskind, Peter, ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'', 1998, p. 389.</ref><ref name=""Total Film pp180-181"">Total Film, ''The 100 greatest films of all time'', pp. 180–181.</ref><ref name=""Thompson p80"">Thompson, David and Christie, Ian, ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', p. 80.</ref> Scorsese went to two matches at [[Madison Square Garden]] to aid his research, picking up on minor but essential details such as the blood sponge and subsequently, the blood on the ropes (which would later be used in the film).<ref name=""Thompson p80"" /> According to the brief comments on the inlay card of the ''Raging Bull'' DVD, Scorsese was not—and still is not—a fan of sports or boxing, which he describes as boring. When he saw the blood-soaked sponges being dipped in a bucket, he recalls thinking to himself, 'And they call this sport.'

=== Screenplay ===
Under the guidance of Chartoff and Winkler, [[Mardik Martin]] was asked to start writing the screenplay.<ref name=""Biskind p379"">Biskind, Peter ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'' 1998, p. 379.</ref> According to De Niro, under no circumstances would [[United Artists]] accept Martin's script.<ref name=""Biskind pp384-385"">Biskind, Peter ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'' pp. 384–385</ref> The story was based on the vision of journalist [[Pete Hamill]] of a 1930s and 1940s style, when boxing was known as ""the great dark prince of sports"". De Niro was unimpressed when he finished reading the first draft, however.<ref name=""Baxter pp186-189"">Baxter John ''De Niro A Biography'', pp. 186–189.</ref> ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' screenwriter [[Paul Schrader]] was swiftly brought in to rewrite the script around August 1978.<ref name=""Baxter pp186-189"" /> Some of the changes that Schrader made to the script included a rewrite of the scene with the undercooked steak and inclusion of LaMotta seen masturbating in a [[Florida]] cell. The character of LaMotta's brother, Joey, was finally added, previously absent from Martin's script.<ref name=""Biskind pp384-385"" /><ref name=""Baxter pp186-189"" /> United Artists saw a massive improvement on the quality of the script. However, its chief executives, [[Steven Bach]] and David Field, met with Scorsese, De Niro, and producer [[Irwin Winkler]] in November 1978 to say they were worried that the content would be [[X-rated]] material and have no chance of finding an audience.<ref name=""Biskind p389"" />

According to Scorsese, the script was left to him and De Niro, and they spent two and a half weeks on the island of [[Saint Martin (island)|Saint Martin]] extensively re-building the content of the film.<ref name=""Thompson pp.76/77"" /> The most significant change would be the entire scene when LaMotta fixes his television and then accuses his wife of having an affair. Other changes included the removal of Jake and Joey's father; the reduction of [[organized crime]]'s role in the story and a major re-write of LaMotta's fight with Tony Janiro.<ref name=""Biskind p390"">Biskind, Peter ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'', p. 390.</ref><ref name=""Baxter p193"">Baxter, John ''De Niro A Biography'', p. 193.</ref> They were also responsible for the end sequence where LaMotta is all alone in his dressing room quoting the ""I could have been a contender"" scene from ''[[On the Waterfront]]''.<ref name=""Baxter p193"" /> An extract of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' had been considered but [[Michael Powell]] thought it would be a bad decision within the context of an American film.<ref name=""Thompson pp.76/77"" /> According to Steven Bach, the first two screenwriters (Martin and Schrader) would receive credit, but since there was no payment to the writer's guild on the script, De Niro and Scorsese's work would remain uncredited.<ref name=""Baxter p193"" />

=== Casting ===
[[File:Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci, 1980.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Cathy Moriarty (left) and Joe Pesci (right) on the set]]
One of Scorsese's trademarks was casting many actors and actresses new to the profession.<ref name=""Evans p65"">Evans, Mike ''The Making of Raging Bull'', p. 65.</ref> De Niro, who was already committed to play Jake LaMotta, began to help Scorsese track down unfamiliar names to play his on-screen brother, Joey, and wife, Vikki.<ref name=""Evans p61"">Evans, Mike ''The Making of Raging Bull'', p. 61.</ref><ref name=""Baxter pp196-201"">Baxter, John ''De Niro A Biography'' pp. 196–201</ref> The role of Joey LaMotta was the first to be cast. De Niro was watching a low budget television film called ''[[The Death Collector]]'' when he saw the part of a young career criminal played by [[Joe Pesci]] (then an unknown and struggling actor) as an ideal candidate. Prior to receiving a call from De Niro and Scorsese for the proposal to star in the film, Pesci had not worked in film for four years and was working at an Italian restaurant in [[New Jersey]].
The role of Vikki (respelled as Vickie in the final film), Jake's second wife, had interest across the board, but it was Pesci who suggested the then unknown [[Cathy Moriarty]] from a picture he once saw at a [[New Jersey]] disco.<ref name=""Baxter pp196-201"" /> Both De Niro and Scorsese believed that Moriarty, then 18, could portray the role after meeting with her on several occasions and noticing her husky voice and physical maturity. The duo had to prove to the [[Screen Actors Guild]] that she was right for the role when [[Cis Corman]] showed 10 comparing pictures of both Moriarty and the real Vikki LaMotta for proof she had a resemblance.<ref name=""Baxter pp196-201"" /> Moriarty was then asked to take a screen test which she managed—partly aided with some improvised lines from De Niro—after some confusion wondering why the crew were filming her take. Joe Pesci also persuaded his former show-biz pal and co-star in ''[[The Death Collector]]'', [[Frank Vincent]], to try for the role of Salvy Batts. Following a successful audition and screen test, Vincent received the call to say he had received the part.<ref name=""Evans pp.65/66"">Evans, Mike, ''The Making of Raging Bull'', pp.&nbsp;65/66.</ref> [[Charles Scorsese]], the director's father, made his film debut as Tommy Como's cousin, Charlie.<ref name=""Evans pp.65/66"" />

While in the midst of practicing a [[Bronx accent]] and preparing for his role, De Niro met both LaMotta and his ex-wife, [[Vikki LaMotta|Vikki]], on separate occasions. Vikki, who lived in [[Florida]], told stories about her life with her former husband and also showed old home movies (that later inspired a similar sequence to be done for the film).<ref name=""Total Film pp180-181"" /><ref name=""Baxter p192"">Baxter, John, ''De Niro: A Biography'', p. 192.</ref> Jake LaMotta, on the other hand, served as his trainer, accompanied by [[Al Silvani]] as coach at the Gramercy club in New York City, getting him into shape. The actor found that boxing came naturally to him; he entered as a middleweight boxer, winning two of his three fights in a [[Brooklyn]] ring dubbed ""young LaMotta"" by the commentator. According to Jake LaMotta, De Niro was one of the top 20 best middleweight boxers of all time.<ref name=""Total Film pp180-181"" /><ref name=""Baxter pp196-201"" />

=== Principal photography ===
[[File:filming the boxing scenes.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Filming of the boxing scenes with director, Scorsese (center left, with beard) and the director of photography, Michael Chapman (center right, with white shirt)]]
According to the production mixer, Michael Evje, the film began shooting at the Los Angeles Olympic Auditorium on April 16, 1979. [[Grip (job)|Grips]] hung huge curtains of black [[duvetyne]] on all four sides of the ring area to contain the artificial smoke used extensively for visual effect. On May 7, the production moved to the [[Culver City, California|Culver City]]  Studio, Stage 3, and filmed there until the middle of June. Scorsese made it clear during filming that he did not appreciate the traditional way in films of showing fights from the spectators' view.<ref name=""Thompson p80"" /> He insisted that one camera operated by the Director of Photography, [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], would be placed inside the ring as he would play the role of an opponent keeping out of the way of other fighters so that viewers could see the emotions of the fighters, including those of Jake.<ref name=""Baxter pp196-201"" /> The precise moves of the boxers were to be done as dance routines from the information of a book about dance instructors in the mode of [[Arthur Murray]]. A punching bag in the middle of the ring was used by De Niro between takes before he aggressively came straight on to do the next scene.<ref name=""Baxter pp196-201"" /><ref name=""Thompson and Christie pp83-84"">Thompson and Christie, ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', pp. 83–84.</ref> The initial five-week schedule for the shooting of the boxing scenes took longer than expected, putting Scorsese under pressure.<ref name=""Baxter pp196-201"" />

According to Scorsese, production of the film was then closed down for around four months with the entire crew being paid, so De Niro could go on a binge eating trip around [[northern Italy]] and France.<ref name=""Total Film pp180-181"" /><ref name=""Thompson and Christie pp83-84"" /> When he did come back to the United States, his weight had increased from 145 to 215&nbsp;pounds (66 to 97&nbsp;kg).<ref name=""Baxter pp196-201"" /> The scenes with the heftier Jake LaMotta—which include announcing his retirement from boxing and LaMotta ending up in a Florida cell—were completed while approaching Christmas 1979 between seven and eight weeks later so as not to aggravate the health issues which were already affecting De Niro's posture, breathing, and talking.<ref name=""Baxter pp196-201"" /><ref name=""Thompson and Christie pp83-84"" /><ref name=""Baxter p83"">Baxter, John, ''The Making of Raging Bull'', p. 83.</ref>

According to Evje, Jake's nightclub sequence was filmed in a closed-down [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]] club on December 3. The jail cell head-banging scene was shot on a constructed set with De Niro asking for minimal crew to be present—there was not even a boom operator.

The final sequence where Jake LaMotta is in front of his mirror was filmed on the last day of shooting, requiring 19 takes, with only the 13th being used for the film. Scorsese wanted to have an atmosphere that would be so cold that the words would have an impact as he tries to come to terms with his relationship with his brother.<ref name=""Thompson pp.76/77"" />

=== Post-production ===
The editing of ''Raging Bull'' began when production was temporarily put on hold and was completed in 1980.<ref name=""Thompson and Christie pp83-84"" /><ref name=""Biskind p399"" /> Scorsese worked with the editor, [[Thelma Schoonmaker]], to achieve a final cut of the film. Their main decision was to abandon Schrader's idea of LaMotta's nightclub act interweaving with the flashback of his youth and instead they just followed along the lines of a single flashback where only scenes of LaMotta practicing his stand-up would be left [[bookend scene|bookending]] the film.<ref name=""Baxter p90"">Evans, Mike ''The Making of Raging Bull'', p. 90.</ref> A sound mix arranged by [[Frank Warner (sound editor)|Frank Warner]] was a delicate process taking six months.<ref name=""Biskind p399"" /> According to Scorsese, the sound on ''Raging Bull'' was difficult because each punch, camera shot, and flash bulb would be different. Also, there was the issue of trying to balance the quality between scenes featuring dialogue and those involving boxing (which were done in [[Dolby Stereo]]).<ref name=""Thompson and Christie pp83-84"" /> ''Raging Bull'' went through a test screening in front of a small audience including the chief executives of United Artists, [[Steven Bach]] and [[Andy Albeck]]. The screening was shown at the MGM screening room in New York around July 1980. Later, Albeck praised Scorsese by calling him a ""true artist"".<ref name=""Biskind p399"" />

According to the producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler, matters were made worse when United Artists decided not to distribute the film but no other studios were interested when they attempted to sell the rights.<ref name=""Biskind p399"" /> Scorsese made no secret that ''Raging Bull'' would be his ""[[Cinema in the United States|Hollywood]] swan song"" and he took unusual care of its rights during post-production.<ref name=""Friedman p115"" /> Scorsese threatened to remove his credit from the film if he was not allowed to sort a reel which obscured the name of a whisky brand known as ""[[Cutty Sark (whisky)|Cutty Sark]]"" which was heard in a scene. The work was completed only four days shy of the premiere.<ref name=""Baxter p204"">Baxter, John ''De Niro A biography'', p. 204.</ref>

In 2012, ''Raging Bull'' was voted by the [[Motion Picture Editors Guild]] as the best-edited film in history.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 75 Best Edited Films Of All Time |publisher=Motion Picture Editors Guild |work=IndieWire |date=February 2015 |url=https://indiewire.com/2015/02/the-75-best-edited-films-of-all-time-267420/ |access-date=March 14, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314155912/http://www.indiewire.com/2015/02/the-75-best-edited-films-of-all-time-267420/ |archive-date=March 14, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Copyright litigation ===
Paula Petrella, heir to Frank Petrello whose works were allegedly sources for the film, filed for copyright infringement in 2009 based on MGM's 1991 copyright renewal of the film. In 2014, the Supreme Court held, in ''[[Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.]]'', that Petrella's suit survived MGM's defense of ""[[laches (equity)|laches]]"", the legal doctrine that protects defendants from unreasonable delays by potential plaintiffs. The case was remanded to lower courts, meaning that Petrella could receive a decision on the merits of her claim.<ref>Eriq Gardner, [https://hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/supreme-court-allows-raging-bull-705572 ""Supreme Court Allows 'Raging Bull' Heiress to Sue MGM for Copyright Damages""] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522052032/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/supreme-court-allows-raging-bull-705572 |date=May 22, 2014 }}, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', May 19, 2014.</ref> MGM settled with Petrella in 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=After Supreme Court, MGM Settles 'Raging Bull' Rights Dispute |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=April 5, 2015 |first=Eriq |last=Gardner |url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/supreme-court-mgm-settles-raging-786449 |access-date=June 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905135348/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/supreme-court-mgm-settles-raging-786449 |archive-date=September 5, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
The brew of violence and anger, combined with the lack of a proper advertising campaign, led to the film's lukewarm box office intake of only $23&nbsp;million, when compared to its $18&nbsp;million budget. By the time it left theaters, it only earned $10.1&nbsp;million in [[Gross rental|theatrical rentals]] (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US-GDP|10.1|1980|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}).<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Unstoppables |publisher=New York: Sussex Publishers, LLC |author=Spy |journal=Spy: The New York Monthly |date=Nov 1988 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KJly6nVC7qkC&q=An+Officer+and+a+Gentleman+1982+budget&pg=PA92 |issn=0890-1759 |page=90 |author-link=Spy (magazine) |access-date=October 28, 2020 |archive-date=February 6, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210206085526/https://books.google.com/books?id=KJly6nVC7qkC&q=An+Officer+and+a+Gentleman+1982+budget&pg=PA92 |url-status=live }}</ref> Scorsese became concerned for his future career and worried that producers and studios might refuse to finance his films.<ref name=""Evans pp124-129"" /> According to [[Box Office Mojo]], the film grossed $23,383,987 in domestic theaters (equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US-GDP|23,383,987|1980|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}).<ref name=""BOMJ"">{{Mojo title | id=ragingbull | title=Raging Bull}}</ref>

=== Critical response ===
When it first premiered in New York City on November 14, 1980, the initial release of ''Raging Bull'' was met with polarized reviews, but the film would later receive widespread critical acclaim and is widely regarded as one of Scorsese's best works.<ref name=""Biskind p399"">Biskind, Peter ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'' 1999, p.399.</ref><ref name=""Baxter p90"" />

On the  [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 92% based on 149 reviews, with an average rating of 9.00/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Arguably Martin Scorsese's and Robert De Niro's finest film, ''Raging Bull'' is often painful to watch, but it's a searing, powerful work about an unsympathetic hero.""<ref>{{cite web |url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/raging_bull/ |title=''Raging Bull'' Movie Reviews, Pictures |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=October 10, 2023 |archive-date=October 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013080614/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/raging_bull/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Metacritic]] which assigns a weighted average, gave it a score of 90 out of 100, based on 28 reviews, indicating ""universal acclaim"".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/raging-bull |title=''Raging Bull'' Movie Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=April 6, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218180746/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/raging-bull |archive-date=December 18, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Jack Kroll of ''[[Newsweek]]'' called ''Raging Bull'' the ""best movie of the year"".<ref name=""Biskind p399"" /> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that Scorsese ""has made his most ambitious film as well as his finest"" and went on to praise Moriarty's debut performance saying: ""either she is one of the film finds of the decade or Mr. Scorsese is [[Svengali]].

Jai and Veeru are small-time crooks who are released from prison, where they are recruited by a former [[police Inspector|Inspector]] [[Thakur (title)|Thakur]] Baldev Singh to capture a notorious [[dacoit]] named Gabbar Singh wanted for {{INR|50000}},{{efn|name=exchange|The exchange rate in 1975 was 8.94 Indian rupees ({{INR}}) per 1 US dollar (US$).{{sfn|Statistical Abstract of the United States|1977|p=917}}}} as the duo had saved Thakur from a train robbery which makes Thakur to recruit them for the mission with an additional {{INR|20000}} reward. The duo leave for Thakur's village in [[Chambal (region)|Ramgarh]], where Gabbar is residing and terrorizing the villagers.

After reaching Ramgarh, Veeru falls for Basanti, a feisty talkative [[Driving (horse)|horse-cart driver]]. Jai meets Thakur's widowed daughter-in-law Radha and falls for her, who later reciprocates his feelings. The two thwart Gabbar's dacoits, who came to extort money. During the festival of [[Holi]], Gabbar's gang attacks the villagers where they corner Jai and Veeru, but the duo manage to attack and chase them away from the village. The duo are upset at Thakur's inaction (when Jai and Veeru were cornered, Thakur had a gun within his reach, but did not help them) and consider calling off the mission. Thakur reveals that a few years ago, Gabbar had killed his family members (except Radha and Ramlal), and had both his arms cut off; he concealed the [[dismemberment]] by always wearing a [[shawl]], which was the sole reason he could not use the gun.

Seeing how much Thakur has suffered, Jai and Veeru took pity by taking an oath that they will capture Gabbar alive, free of charge. After learning the duo's heroics, Gabbar kills the local [[imam]] Rahim Chacha's son Ahmed, all to threaten the villagers to make Jai and Veeru surrender to him. The villagers refuse and instead get the duo to kill a few of Gabbar's [[Henchman|henchmen]] in revenge for the boy's death. Gabbar angrily retaliates by having his men capture Veeru and Basanti. Jai arrives and attacks the hideout, where the trio are able to flee Gabbar's hideout with dacoits in pursuit. Shooting from behind a rock, Jai and Veeru nearly run out of [[ammunition]]. Unaware that Jai was wounded in the [[Shootout|gunfight]], Veeru is forced to leave for more ammunition and also to drop Basanti at a safe place.

Jai sacrifices himself by using his last bullet to ignite [[dynamite|dynamite sticks]] on a bridge from close range, killing Gabbar's men. Veeru returns, and Jai dies, leaving Radha and Veeru devastated. Enraged, Veeru attacks Gabbar's den and kills his remaining men where he catches Gabbar and nearly beats him to death. Thakur appears and reminds Veeru of the vow to hand over Gabbar alive. Thakur uses his [[Track spikes|spike]]-soled shoes to severely injure Gabbar and his hands. The police arrive and arrest Gabbar for his crimes. After Jai's funeral, Veeru leaves Ramgarh and finds Basanti waiting for him on the train.","Action, Adventure, Comedy","starring       = {{Plainlist|

In AD [[932]], [[King Arthur]] and his squire, Patsy, travel [[Britain (place name)|Britain]] searching for men to join the [[Knights of the Round Table]].

He recruits [[Bedivere|Sir Bedevere the Wise]], [[Lancelot|Sir Lancelot the Brave]], [[Galahad|Sir Galahad the Pure]], Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, and the aptly named Sir Not-Appearing-in-this-Film, along with their squires and Robin's minstrels. Arthur leads the knights to [[Camelot]], but, after a musical number, changes his mind, deeming it ""a silly place"". As they turn away, [[God]] appears and orders Arthur to find the [[Holy Grail]].

Arthur and his knights arrive at a castle occupied by French soldiers, who claim to have the Grail and taunt the Britons, driving them back with a barrage of barnyard animals. Bedevere concocts a plan to sneak in using a [[Trojan Horse|Trojan Rabbit]], but forgets to tell the others to hide inside it; the Knights are forced to flee when it is flung back at them. Arthur decides the knights should go their separate ways to search for the Grail. Meanwhile, a modern-day historian filming a documentary on the Arthurian legends is killed by an unknown knight on horseback, triggering a police investigation.

Arthur and Bedevere are given directions by an old man and attempt to satisfy the strange requests of the dreaded [[Knights Who Say ""Ni!""]] Sir Robin avoids a fight with a Three-Headed Knight by running away while the heads are arguing amongst themselves. Sir Galahad is led by a grail-shaped beacon to Castle Anthrax, which is occupied exclusively by young women, who wish to be punished for misleading him, but is ""rescued"" against his will by Lancelot. Lancelot receives an arrow-shot note from Swamp Castle. Believing the note is from a lady being forced to marry against her will, he storms the castle and slaughters several members of the wedding party, only to discover the note is from an effeminate prince.

Arthur and his knights regroup and are joined by Brother Maynard, his monk brethren, and three new knights: [[Bors]], [[Gawain]] and [[Sir Ector|Ector]]. They meet Tim the Enchanter, who directs them to a cave where the location of the Grail is said to be written. The entrance to the cave is guarded by the [[Rabbit of Caerbannog]]. Underestimating it, the knights attack, but the Rabbit easily kills Bors, Gawain and Ector. Arthur uses the ""Holy Hand Grenade of [[Antioch]]"", provided by Brother Maynard, to destroy the creature. Inside the cave, they find an inscription from [[Joseph of Arimathea]], directing them to Castle Aarrgh and warning them of the ""Legendary Black Beast"", a cave monster whose location of origin is obscured by a screaming sound. In an animated sequence, the Black Beast devours Brother Maynard, but Arthur and the knights escape after the animator unexpectedly suffers a fatal heart attack.

The knights approach the Bridge of Death, where the bridge-keeper demands they answer three questions in order to pass or else be cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril. Lancelot easily answers simple questions and crosses. An overly cocky Robin is defeated by an unexpectedly difficult question, and an indecisive Galahad fails an easy one; both are magically flung into the gorge. When Arthur asks for clarification on a question regarding the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow, the bridge-keeper cannot answer and is himself thrown into the gorge.

Arthur and Bedevere cannot find Lancelot, unaware that he has been arrested by police investigating the historian's death. The pair reach Castle Aarrgh, but find it occupied by the French soldiers from earlier in the film. After being repelled by showers of manure, they summon an army of knights and prepare to assault the castle. As the army charges, the police arrive, arrest Arthur and Bedevere on suspicion of the murder of the historian, and break the camera, abruptly ending the film.","Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","starring       = {{Plainlist|

183,Judgment at Nuremberg,"== Plot ==
''Judgment at Nuremberg'' centers on a [[military tribunal]] convened in [[Nuremberg]], [[Germany]], in which four German judges and prosecutors stand accused of [[crimes against humanity]] for their involvement in atrocities committed under the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime.

Judge Dan Haywood is the chief judge of a three-judge panel of Allied jurists who will hear and decide the case against the defendants. Haywood is particularly interested in learning how the defendant Ernst Janning, a respected jurist and legal scholar, could have committed the atrocities he is accused of, including sentencing innocent people to death.

Haywood seeks to understand how the [[German people]] could have been deaf and blind to the Nazi regime's crimes. In doing so, he befriends the widow of a German general who had been executed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. He talks with other Germans who have varying perspectives on the war.

Other characters the judge meets are [[United States Army|US Army]] Captain Harrison Byers, who is assigned to assist the American judges hearing the case, and Irene Hoffmann, who is afraid to provide testimony that may bolster the prosecution's case against the judges. (Hoffman's character bears a resemblance to Irene Seiler, a key figure in the notorious [[Nazi]] [[kangaroo court]] case, the [[Katzenberger Trial]].)

German defense attorney Hans Rolfe argues that the defendants were not the only ones to aid or ignore the Nazi regime. He claims the United States has committed acts just as bad or worse than the Nazis, such as [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]]'s support for the first [[eugenics]] practices; the German-[[Holy See|Vatican]] ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' of 1933, which the Nazi-dominated German government exploited as an implicit early foreign recognition of Nazi leadership; [[Joseph Stalin]]'s part in the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Nazi-Soviet Pact]] of 1939, which removed the last major obstacle to Germany's [[Invasion of Poland|invasion]] and [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupation]] of western [[Poland]], initiating [[World War II]]; and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in the final stage of the war in August 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/288385%7C0/Pop-Culture-101-Judgment-at-Nuremberg.html |last=Nixon |first=Rob |title=Pop Culture 101: ''Judgment at Nuremberg'' |website=TCM.com |year=2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715094348/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/288385%7C0/Pop-Culture-101-Judgment-at-Nuremberg.html |archive-date=2018-07-15 |access-date=2012-11-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mann |first=Abby |title=Judgment at Nuremberg |location=London |publisher=Cassell |year=1961 |page=93}}</ref>

Meanwhile, as a strict constructionist jurist, Janning refuses to testify or participate in a legal proceeding that he profoundly feels is no better than a post-WWII Western kangaroo court of its own. As the proceeding becomes more and more intolerable to him, he dramatically breaks his silence. He chooses to testify before the Tribunal as a witness for the prosecution, admitting he is guilty of condemning to death a [[Jewish]] man of ""[[Rassenschande|blood defilement]]"" charges — namely, that the man had sex with a 16-year-old [[Gentile]] girl — when he knew there was no evidence to support such a verdict. Janning explains that well-meaning people such as him helped [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]], [[racism|racist]] policies out of patriotism despite knowing it was wrong, and that all of Germany [[collective guilt|bears some measure of responsibility]] for the [[Nazi war crimes|atrocities committed by the Nazi regime]].

Haywood must weigh considerations of [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] expediency against his own ideals of justice. The trial is set against the background of the [[Berlin Blockade]], and there is pressure to let the German defendants off lightly to gain German support in the growing [[Cold War]] against the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/JudgmentAtNuremberg.html|title=Judgment at Nuremberg|access-date=2008-09-27|last=Bradley|first=Sean|publisher=[[University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law]]|quote=He argues that the love of country led to an attitude of ""my country right or wrong.""

While the four defendants maintain their pleas of ""not guilty"" in their closing statements, Janning and fellow defendant, Werner Lampe, show clear remorse for their actions, while a third, Friedrich Hofstetter, claims they [[superior orders|had no choice]] but to execute the laws handed down by Hitler's government. Only the fourth defendant, Emil Hahn, remains unrepentant, telling the Americans that they will live to regret not allying with the Nazis against the Soviet Union. Ultimately, all four defendants are found guilty and sentenced to [[life in prison]].

Haywood visits Janning in his cell. Janning affirms to Haywood that his verdict was a just one, but asks him to believe that, regarding the mass murder of innocents, he never knew that it would come to that. Judge Haywood replies it came to that the first time Janning condemned a man he knew to be innocent.

Haywood departs; a [[title card]] informs the audience that, of 99 defendants sentenced to prison terms in [[Subsequent Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg trials that took place in the American Zone]], none was still serving a sentence when the film was released in 1961.<ref name=""AFI"">{{cite web |title=''Judgment at Nuremberg'' (1961) |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/23848 |url-status= |archive-date= |access-date=2024-02-18 |website=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]] |publisher=American Film Institute}}</ref>{{efn|This does not refer to the 1946 [[Nuremberg trials]] of the leadership of [[Nazi Germany]], which was in front of an international panel of judges, not solely American ones.

Broke, terrified, and desperate to leave Chicago, Joe and Jerry [[Drag (entertainment)|disguise themselves as women]] named Josephine and Daphne so they can join Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators, an all-female band headed by train to [[Miami]]. On the train, Joe and Jerry befriend Sugar Kane, the band's vocalist and [[ukulele]] player.

Joe and Jerry become obsessed with Sugar and compete for her affection while maintaining their disguises. Sugar confides to ""Josephine"" that she has sworn off male saxophone players, who have taken advantage of her in the past. She hopes to find a gentle, bespectacled millionaire in [[Florida]]. ""Josephine"" and ""Daphne"" become close friends with Sugar during a late-night party on the train and struggle to remember that flirting with her would compromise their cover.
[[File:Some Like it Hot (1959) trailer.webm|thumb|The film's trailer]]
Once in Miami, Joe woos Sugar by affecting a [[Mid-Atlantic accent]] and posing as oil heir ""[[Shell plc|Shell Oil]] Junior"" while feigning indifference to her. An actual millionaire, the much-married, aging Osgood Fielding III, persistently pursues ""Daphne"", whose refusals only increase his appetite. He invites ""her"" to dinner on his yacht. Joe convinces Jerry to keep Osgood occupied onshore so that ""Junior"" can take Sugar to Osgood's yacht and pass it off as his own. On the yacht, ""Junior"" tells Sugar that [[Psychological pain|psychological trauma]] from the death of a former lover has left him impotent, but that he would marry anyone who could cure him. Sugar tries to arouse him, with considerable success. Meanwhile, ""Daphne"" and Osgood dance the [[tango]] (""[[La Cumparsita]]"") until dawn. When Joe and Jerry get back to the hotel, Jerry announces that Osgood has proposed marriage to ""Daphne"" and that he has accepted, anticipating a divorce and cash settlement when his ruse is revealed. Joe convinces Jerry that he cannot marry Osgood.

The hotel hosts a conference for the ""Friends of Italian Opera Society"", a front for a national Mafia meeting presided over by ""Little Bonaparte"". Spats and his gang recognize Joe and Jerry as the witnesses they have been looking for. Fearing for their lives, Joe and Jerry realize they must quit the band and leave the hotel. Joe conceals his deception from Sugar by telling her over the telephone that ""Junior"" must marry a woman of his father's choosing and move to [[Venezuela]]. Sugar becomes distressed and heartbroken. Joe and Jerry evade Spats' men by hiding under a table at the syndicate banquet, where Little Bonaparte [[Roasting|roasts]] Spats and has him and his men killed. Joe and Jerry flee through the hotel after being spotted. Joe, dressed as Josephine, sees Sugar onstage singing a lament to lost love. He runs onto the platform and kisses her, causing her to realize that Josephine and Junior were the same person.

Jerry persuades Osgood to take ""Daphne"" and ""Josephine"" away on his yacht. Sugar runs from the stage at the end of her performance and jumps aboard Osgood's launch just as it is leaving the dock. Joe confesses the truth to Sugar and tells her that she deserves better, but Sugar wants him anyway, realizing he is the first man to genuinely care for her. Meanwhile, Jerry tries to get out of his engagement by listing reasons why ""Daphne"" and Osgood cannot marry, none of which bother Osgood. Exasperated, Jerry rips off his wig and says ""I'm a man!"" in his normal voice; still smiling, Osgood replies ""Well, nobody's perfect,"" confounding Jerry and leaving him speechless.","Comedy, Music, Romance","starring       = {{ubl|[[Marilyn Monroe]]|[[Tony Curtis]]|[[Jack Lemmon]]|[[George Raft]]|[[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]]|[[Joe E.

188,Dial M for Murder,"==Plot==
In the mid-1950s Tony Wendice, a retired English professional tennis player, is married to wealthy socialite Margot, who has been having an affair with Mark Halliday, an American crime-fiction writer. Unbeknownst to them, Tony knows about the affair and plots Margot's murder to inherit her fortune, fearing a divorce would leave him penniless.

Tony is also aware that Charles Swann, an old acquaintance from [[Cambridge University]], is a small-time con man with a criminal record. Tony invites Swann to his [[Maida Vale]] flat on a pretext and tells him about Margot's affair. Tony also confides that six months previously he had stolen Margot's handbag, which contained a love letter from Mark, and had anonymously blackmailed her. After tricking Swann into leaving his fingerprints on the letter, Tony entraps him, threatening to turn him in as Margot's blackmailer unless he kills Margot. With the added inducement of £1,000 in cash, Swann agrees to the murder. Tony then explains that he and Mark will attend a party while Margot stays at home alone. At a specific time when Margot is certain to be in bed, Swann will enter the front door, which is always unlocked, and will enter the locked door of the flat with Margot's latchkey, which Tony will hide on the staircase under a carpet. Tony will then telephone the flat from the party and Swann will kill Margot when she answers the call. Swann will whistle over the phone to signal the job is done, then create signs of a burglary gone wrong and put the key back under the staircase carpet as he is leaving the building.

The following night Swann enters the flat and Tony rings as planned. When Margot comes to the phone, Swann tries to strangle her with his scarf, but she fatally stabs him with scissors. Upon hearing Margot plead for help instead of Swann's whistle, Tony advises her not to speak to anyone. He returns home, calls the police, sends Margot to bed and transfers what he thinks is Margot's key from Swann's pocket into her handbag. He also attempts to frame Margot by planting Mark's letter on Swann and destroying Swann's scarf.
[[File:Redwood Drive-In Ad - 11 August 1954, Santa Rosa, CA.jpg|170px|thumb|left|[[Drive-in theater|Drive-in]] advertisement from 1954.]]
The next day Tony persuades Margot to hide the fact that he told her not to call the police. Chief Inspector Hubbard arrives to question the Wendices, though Margot makes several conflicting statements. When Hubbard says the evidence indicates that Swann entered through the front door, Tony claims that Swann must have been responsible for stealing Margot's handbag, and made a copy of her key. As Tony intends, Hubbard does not believe the story and arrests Margot after concluding that she killed Swann for blackmailing her. Margot is found guilty of murder and [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|sentenced to death]].

Months later, on the day before Margot's scheduled execution, Mark visits Tony, saying he has devised a story for him to tell the police to save Margot. Mark's ""story"" is very close to what actually happened: that Tony paid Swann to kill Margot. If Tony confesses to Mark’s story, Tony would go to jail for a while, but Margot would be saved. Hubbard arrives unexpectedly, and Mark hides in the bedroom. Hubbard asks Tony about large sums of cash he has been spending around town, tricks Tony into revealing that his latchkey is in his raincoat, and inquires about Tony's [[attaché case]]. Tony claims to have misplaced the case, but Mark, overhearing the conversation, finds it on the bed, full of banknotes. Deducing that the money was Tony's intended payoff to Swann, Mark confronts Tony and explains his theory to Hubbard. Tony ""confesses"" that the cash was Margot's blackmail payment to Swann, which he had concealed to protect her. Hubbard appears to accept Tony's explanation, and Mark leaves angrily. Hubbard discreetly swaps his own raincoat with Tony's. As soon as Tony leaves, Hubbard uses Tony's key to re-enter the flat, followed by Mark. Hubbard previously discovered that the key in Margot's handbag was Swann's own latchkey and deduced that Swann had put the Wendices' key back in its hiding place after unlocking the door. Now, correctly suspecting Tony of having conspired with Swann, Hubbard has developed an elaborate ruse to trap him.

Plainclothes police officers bring Margot from prison to the flat. She tries unsuccessfully to unlock the door with the key in her handbag, then enters through the garden, proving to Hubbard that she is unaware of the hidden key and is therefore innocent. Hubbard has Margot's handbag returned to the police station, where Tony retrieves it after discovering that he has no key. The key from Margot's bag does not work, so he uses the hidden key to open the door, demonstrating his guilt and exonerating Margot. With his escape routes blocked by Hubbard and another policeman, Tony calmly makes himself a drink and congratulates Hubbard.","Crime, Thriller","starring       = [[Ray Milland]]<br>[[Grace Kelly]]<br>[[Robert Cummings]]<br>[[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]]

The story begins [[in medias res]], told via narration by acerbic theatre critic Addison DeWitt, who introduces the various characters as they attend the ceremony for the distinguished Sarah Siddons Award for Prestigious Achievement, awarded to rising star actor Eve Harrington. DeWitt's narration promises the audience will learn Eve's true story as the narrative voice switches to that of Karen Richards.

Some years previous, [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] star Margo Channing, recently turned 40, worries about what advancing age will mean for her career. After a performance of Margo's latest play, Margo's close friend, Karen Richards, wife of the play's author Lloyd Richards, brings besotted fan Eve Harrington backstage to meet Margo. In Margo's dressing room, Eve tells Karen, Lloyd, and Margo's maid Birdie, that she followed Margo's last theatrical tour to [[New York City]] after seeing her perform in [[San Francisco]]. She tells an engrossing story of growing up poor in [[Wisconsin]] and losing her young husband, Eddie, in the [[Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II|South Pacific]] during [[World War II]]. Moved by Eve's story, Margo takes her into her home as her assistant, upsetting Birdie. Eve quickly manipulates her way into Margo's life, acting as both secretary and adoring fan.

Adding to Margo's concerns about aging is her romantic relationship with the play's director, Bill Sampson, 8 years her junior. Without telling Margo, Eve places a long-distance phone call ""on Margo's behalf"" to Bill when Margo forgets his birthday. This results in Margo's embarrassment, exposing her to Bill's realizing that Margo forgot his birthday, while Eve remembered and even sent her own greetings. Margo grows increasingly distrustful toward Eve, particularly after catching Eve taking a bow in front of a mirror while pretending to wear Margo's costume. Margo asks producer Max Fabian to hire Eve at his office, but instead, Eve becomes Margo's [[understudy]] without Margo's knowledge.
[[File:All About Eve trailer (1950).webm|thumb|The film's trailer]]
As Margo's irritation grows, Karen sympathizes with Eve, believing that Margo is overdramatizing her resentment of Eve out of temperamental peevishness. Hoping to humble Margo, Karen conspires for her to miss a performance so that Eve can perform. Eve invites the city's theater critics to attend the performance – including the influential DeWitt. Eve's performance is a triumph. Later that night, Eve  attempts to seduce Bill, who as a successful Broadway producer might be useful to her career. Bill  rejects Eve, letting her know that he sees her manipulations. Instead, Addison takes an interest in Eve. He interviews her for a column, harshly criticizing Margo for resisting younger talent.

Margo and Bill announce their engagement at dinner with Lloyd and Karen. Eve summons Karen to the ladies' room and, after first appearing regretful, delivers an ultimatum: Karen must recommend her to Lloyd to play Cora, the lead role in Lloyd's new play. Otherwise, she will reveal Karen's part in Margo's missed performance. When Karen returns to the table—to her relief—Margo surprisingly announces that she does not wish to play Cora, saying she is too old for the ingénue role.

Eve is cast as Cora. Just before the new play's premiere in [[New Haven]], Eve reveals her next plan to Addison: to marry Lloyd—who she has seduced despite his wife Karen's championship of her—so that Lloyd can write plays for her to star in. Angered with Eve's audacity, Addison says he knows her backstory is entirely lies; her real name is Gertrude Slescynski, she was never married, and she was paid to leave town over an affair with her married boss. He also says Lloyd would never leave Karen for Eve. Addison then blackmails Eve, saying she now ""belongs"" to him.

The story catches up to the opening scene; months later, Eve is a Broadway star headed for Hollywood. While accepting the Sarah Siddons Award, she thanks Margo, Bill, Lloyd, and Karen as all four coldly stare back. Eve skips the after-party and returns home, where she encounters Phoebe, a teenage fan who slipped into her apartment and fell asleep. Phoebe professes her adoration and ingratiates herself with Eve, then begins packing her trunk. Eve invites her to stay over rather than take the long subway ride back to Brooklyn. While Eve is resting, Addison brings Eve's forgotten award to the door and is greeted by Phoebe, who admits she chose her own theatrical name. Addison realizes Phoebe will do to Eve what Eve did to Margo. When she is alone, Phoebe puts on Eve's elegant cloak and poses in front of a floor-length mirror, holding the award and bowing.",Drama,"starring       = {{Plainlist|

194,The Gold Rush,"==Plot==
''The following is the plot of the 1942 re-release:''

During the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], in [[District of Alaska|Alaska]], [[Gold prospecting|gold prospector]] Big Jim finds an enormous gold deposit on his parcel of land when a [[blizzard]] strikes. [[The Tramp|The Lone Prospector]] gets lost in the same blizzard while also prospecting for gold. He stumbles into the cabin of Black Larsen, a wanted criminal. Larsen tries to throw the Prospector out when Jim also stumbles inside. Larsen tries to scare both out using his shotgun but is overpowered by Jim, and the three agree to a truce allowing them all to stay in the cabin.

When the storm is taking so long that food is running out, the three draw lots for who will have to go out into the blizzard to obtain food. Larsen loses and leaves the cabin. While outside looking for food, he encounters Jim's gold deposit and decides to ambush him there when Jim returns.

Meanwhile, the two remaining in the cabin get so desperate that they cook and eat one of the Prospector's shoes. Later, Jim gets delirious, imagines the Prospector as a giant chicken and attacks him. A bear then enters the cabin and is killed, supplying them with food.

[[File:The Gold Rush.webm|left|thumb|thumbtime=1|''The Gold Rush'' 1925<br>(full movie, public domain)]]
After the storm subsides, both leave the cabin, the Prospector continuing on to the next gold boom town while Jim returns to his gold deposit. There, he is knocked out by Larsen with a shovel. While fleeing with some of the mined gold, Larsen dies in an [[avalanche]]. Jim recovers consciousness and wanders into the snow, having lost his memory from the blow. When he returns to the town, his memory has been partly restored and he remembers that he found a large gold deposit, that it was close to a cabin, and that he stayed there with the Prospector. But he knows neither the location of the deposit nor of the cabin, and so looks for the Prospector, hoping that he can lead him to the cabin.

The Prospector arrives at the town and encounters Georgia, a dance hall girl, and [[Love at first sight|falls in love with her]]. To irritate Jack, a man who is making aggressive advances toward Georgia and is pestering her for a dance, she instead decides to dance with ""the most deplorable looking tramp in the dance hall"", the Prospector. After encountering each other again, she accepts his invitation for a [[New Year's Eve]] dinner, but does not take it seriously and forgets about it. On New Year's Eve, while waiting for her to arrive to the dinner, the Prospector imagines entertaining her with a dance of [[bread roll]]s on forks. When she does not arrive until midnight, he walks alone through the streets, desperate. Meanwhile, Georgia remembers his invitation and decides to visit him. Finding his home empty but seeing the meticulously prepared dinner and a present for her, she has a change of heart and prepares a note asking to talk to him.
	
When the Prospector is handed the note, he goes searching for Georgia. Jim finds him and drags him away to go search for the cabin, giving the Prospector only enough time to tell Georgia that he will return to her as a millionaire. Jim and the Prospector find the cabin and stay for the night. Overnight, another blizzard blows the cabin half over a cliff right next to Jim's gold deposit. The next morning the cabin is rocking dangerously over the cliff edge while the two try to escape. Jim eventually gets out and pulls the Prospector to safety right when the cabin falls off the cliff.

One year later, both have become wealthy, but the Prospector never could find Georgia. They return to the [[contiguous United States]] on a ship on which, unknown to them, Georgia is also traveling. When the Prospector agrees to don his old clothes for a photograph, he falls down the stairs, encountering Georgia once more. After she mistakenly thinks he is a [[stowaway]] and tries to save him from the ship's crew, the misunderstanding is cleared up and both are happily reunited.","Adventure, Comedy, Drama","starring       = Charlie Chaplin<br />[[Georgia Hale]]<br />[[Mack Swain]]<br />[[Tom Murray (actor)|Tom Murray]]<br />[[Malcolm Waite]]

[[File:Sherlock Jr. (1924).webm|thumb|left|thumbtime=2|''Sherlock, Jr.'']]
Buster Keaton stars as Projectionist, who moonlights as an amateur detective. When the cinema is empty, he reads the book ''How to be a Detective.'' He is in love with The Girl ([[Kathryn McGuire]]) but  has a rival, ""The Local Sheik"" ([[Ward Crane]]). Neither has much money. He finds a dollar note in the garbage he swept up in the lobby. He takes it and adds it to the $2 he has. A woman comes and says that she lost a dollar. He gives it back. But then a sad old woman also says that she lost a dollar, so he gives that also, leaving himself with $1. A man comes and searches the garbage and finds a wallet full of money. Projectionist buys a $1 box of chocolates, all he can afford, and changes the price to $4 before giving it to the woman he loves at her house. He later gives her a ring.

The Sheik comes into the house and steals the [[pocket watch]] of the Girl's Father ([[Joe Keaton]]) and pawns it for $4. With the money, he buys a $3 box of chocolates for the Girl. When the Father notices that his watch is missing, the Sheik slips the pawn ticket into the Projectionist's pocket unnoticed. The Projectionist offers to solve the crime, but when the pawn ticket is found in his pocket, he is banished from the house. When the Sheik leaves, the Projectionist shadows his every movement. The Sheik loses him by shutting him in a train car. Later, the Girl takes the pawn ticket to the pawnbroker and asks him to describe who pawned it. He points to the Sheik, standing outside.

While showing a film (advertised in the lobby as ""Hearts and Pearls"") about the theft of a [[pearl]] necklace, the Projectionist falls asleep and dreams that he enters the movie as a detective, Sherlock Jr. The other actors are replaced by the Projectionist's acquaintances, with the Sheik taking the role of the Villain. The dream begins with the theft being committed by the Villain with the aid of the Butler. The Girl's Father calls for the world's greatest detective and Sherlock Jr. arrives.

Fearing that they will be caught, the Villain and the Butler attempt to kill Sherlock Jr. through several traps, poison, and an elaborate pool game with an exploding 13 ball. When these fail, the Villain and Butler try to escape. Sherlock Jr. tracks them down to a warehouse but is outnumbered by the gang to which the villain was selling the necklace. During the confrontation, Sherlock Jr. discovers that they have kidnapped the Girl. With the help of his assistant, Gillette, Sherlock Jr. manages to save the woman, and after a car chase, manages to defeat the gang.

When he awakens, the Girl shows up to tell him that she and her father learned the identity of the real thief after she went to the pawn shop to see who actually pawned the pocket watch. As a reconciliation scene happens to be playing on the screen, the Projectionist mimics the actor's romantic behavior.","Action, Comedy, Romance","starring       = Buster Keaton

In a cemetery in the former nation of Zubrowka,{{efn|Zubrowka is depicted as an [[alpine country]] located somewhere between Central and Eastern Europe. According to newspapers shown in the film, Zubrowka was a [[constitutional monarchy]] (the Empire of Zubrowka) at least until late 1932, when a neighboring fascist state annexed it during a period of war. In 1936, the country was liberated, and by 1950, it had become a [[socialist republic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://imgur.com/gallery/ZDyFi/comment/1474868899|title=Newspapers & documents from ""The Grand Budapest Hotel""|website=imgur.com|access-date=10 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lilianalambriev.com/work/the-grand-budapest-hotel|title=Chapter 5.

The book, written in 1985, recounts the 1968 vacation of the young writer at the once-grand, then-drab hotel. There, he meets its owner, Zero Moustafa, who tells his [[rags to riches]] story at dinner.

In 1932, Zero is an illegal [[refugee]] escaping a war waged by a [[fascist regime]], which killed his entire family. He is hired as a lobby boy supervised by Monsieur Gustave H., the hotel's [[concierge]]. Gustave strikes up affairs with old, wealthy clients, including [[dowager]] Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe-und-Taxis (known as Madame D.), with whom he's had a nearly two-decade affair. She mysteriously dies a month after her last hotel visit so Gustave and Zero visit her estate, where relatives come for the reading of her will. There, her attorney, Deputy Vilmos Kovacs, announces a recent [[codicil (will)|codicil]] which bequeaths the famous Renaissance painting ''[[Boy with Apple]]'' to Gustave. Madame D.'s son and an agent of the regime, Dmitri, refuses to let it happen. Gustave and Zero abscond with the painting, hiding it in a [[safe]] in the Grand Budapest.

After a testimony by Madame D.'s [[butler]] Serge X, Gustave is arrested by Inspector Alfred J. Henckels for Madame D.'s murder; Serge then goes into hiding. Gustave befriends a gang during his imprisonment and provides them with pastries from Mendl's, a well-known bakery. After extensive research of the prison, one of Gustave's cellmates, Ludwig, tells the gang that they can escape via a storm-drain sewage system. Convinced to join the prison break, Gustave has Zero place hammers, chisels, and sawblades inside pastries made by Agatha, an apprentice of Herr Mendl and Zero's [[fiancée]]. The guard responsible for checking [[contraband]] cannot bring himself to break open the pastries since Mendl's pastries are works of art. During the prison break, the group of convicts runs into guards who secretly gamble at night, and convict Gunther is forced to sacrifice himself to dispatch the guards. The rest of the group manages to escape and disperse. Meanwhile, Dmitri sends his hitman, J. G. Jopling, to kill Kovacs after questioning his loyalty, as well as Serge's sister for hiding his whereabouts.

When Zero and Gustave are reunited, they set out to prove Gustave's innocence with the assistance of a fraternity of concierges known as the Society of the Crossed Keys, which locates Serge and facilitates a meeting between him, Gustave and Zero. Serge reveals that he was pressured to implicate Gustave by the real killer, Dmitri, and that Madame D. had a missing second will, which would only take effect should she be murdered. Jopling arrives and kills Serge, leaving Gustave and Zero without a witness, then tries to flee. After a chase through the snow, Gustave is left dangling off a cliff at the mercy of Jopling. Before it is too late, Zero rescues Gustave by pushing Jopling off the cliff, and the two men continue their escape from swarming Zubrowkan troops led by Henckels.

Gustave, Zero, and Agatha return to the Grand Budapest to find it converted into a fascist headquarters by Dmitri. Agatha sneaks in to retrieve the painting but is spotted by Dmitri. Gustave and Zero rush in to save Agatha, but Dmitri shoots at them and initiates a melee with Zubrowkan troops, which Henckels stops. On the back of the painting, the group finds Madame D.'s second will, which reveals her as the Grand Budapest's owner and bequeaths it to Gustave. He is exonerated in court, while Dmitri becomes the main suspect and flees the country. Over time, Gustave becomes one of the wealthiest Zubrowkans, and Zero and Agatha are wed. However, while the three are later traveling by train, soldiers come by and destroy Zero's refugee documents; Gustave tries to fend them off but is killed. His own will bequeaths the hotel and his fortune to Zero. He maintains the Grand Budapest up to its eventual decline in memory of Agatha who, like their infant son, died from [[Bornholm disease|Prussian Grippe]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Meenan |first=David |date=October 29, 2022 |title=The Grand Budapest Hotel Ending Explained: An Enchanting Old Ruin |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/1067683/the-grand-budapest-hotel-ending-explained-an-enchanting-old-ruin/ |access-date=October 7, 2023 |website=[[/Film]]}}</ref>","Adventure, Comedy, Crime","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--Per poster billing-->

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->
In 1929 [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], young [[Desmond Doss]] nearly kills his brother while roughhousing. That event and his [[Seventh-day Adventist]] upbringing reinforce Desmond's belief in the [[Ten Commandments#Christianity|commandment]] ""[[Thou shalt not kill]]"". Years later, he takes an injured man to the hospital and meets a nurse, Dorothy Schutte. They strike a romance, and Desmond tells her of his interest in medical work.

After the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] brings the United States into World War II, Desmond enlists in the United States Army to serve as a [[combat medic]]. His father, Tom, a [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]-ridden World War I veteran, is deeply upset by the decision. Shortly before leaving, Desmond and Dorothy get engaged.

Desmond is placed in [[basic training]] with the [[77th Sustainment Brigade|77th Infantry Division]] under the command of Sergeant Howell. He excels physically but becomes a pariah among some of his fellow soldiers for refusing to handle a rifle and train on [[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Saturdays]].

Howell and Captain Glover attempt to discharge Desmond for [[Conscientious objection in the United States#Conscientious objectors with Medals of Honor|psychiatric reasons]] under [[Section 8 (military)|Section 8]], but are overruled, as Desmond's religious beliefs do not constitute mental illness.

They subsequently torment Desmond by putting him through grueling labor, intending to drive him out. Despite being beaten one night by his fellow soldiers, he refuses to identify his attackers.

Desmond's unit completes basic training and is released on leave during which Desmond intends to marry Dorothy, but his refusal to carry a firearm leads to an arrest for insubordination. Captain Glover and Dorothy visit Desmond in jail and try to convince him to plead guilty so that he can be released without charge, but he refuses to compromise his beliefs.

At his [[court-martial]], Desmond pleads not guilty, but before he is sentenced, his father bursts into the tribunal with a letter from his former commanding officer, now a [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], stating that his son's pacifism is protected by the [[US Constitution]]. The charges against Desmond are dropped, and he and Dorothy are married.

Desmond’s unit is deployed to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]]. During the [[Battle of Okinawa]], they are tasked with ascending and securing the Maeda Escarpment (""Hacksaw Ridge"").

During the initial fight, with heavy losses on both sides, Desmond saves the life of his squad-mate Smitty, earning his respect. Smitty apologizes for doubting his courage, and Desmond reveals to him that his aversion to holding a firearm stems from nearly shooting his drunken father, who threatened his mother with a gun.

The next morning, the Japanese launch a massive counterattack and drive the Americans off the escarpment. Smitty is killed, and Howell and several of Desmond’s comrades are left injured on the battlefield.

Desmond hears the cries of dying soldiers so returns to save them, carrying the wounded, and Smitty's body, to the cliff's edge and belaying them down by rope, each time praying to save one more. The arrival of dozens of wounded who had been presumed dead comes as a shock to the rest of the unit below. When day breaks, Desmond rescues Howell, and both escape Hacksaw under enemy fire.

Captain Glover apologizes for dismissing Desmond’s beliefs and states that they are scheduled to retake the ridge on Saturday but will not launch the next attack without him. Desmond agrees, but the operation is delayed until after he concludes his [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] prayers.

With reinforcements, they turn the tide of battle. In an ambush set by Japanese soldiers who [[perfidy|pretend to surrender]], Desmond manages to save Glover and others by deflecting enemy [[grenade]]s. He is wounded by a grenade blast, but the battle is won. Desmond is lowered from the cliff, clutching the Bible that Dorothy had given to him.

The film switches to real photos and footage showing that Desmond was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] by President [[Harry S. Truman]] for rescuing 75 soldiers at Hacksaw Ridge, as well as real-life footage of Desmond just before his death, recounting his experiences during the war.","Biography, Drama, History","starring       = {{Plainlist|

215,Barfi!,"== Plot ==
===1972 ===
Murphy, also known as Barfi, is an optimistic, street-smart, charming young man who was born deaf and mute to a couple in [[Darjeeling]]. His mother died after giving birth to him and his father, Jungbahadur raised him alone while working as a chauffeur. Barfi is known as a troublemaker; he cuts lampposts, plays practical jokes, and is chased by Inspector Sudhanshu Dutta, a local police officer. Barfi meets Shruti Ghosh, a gorgeous, educated young girl who has just arrived in Darjeeling. She is engaged to Ranjeet Sengupta and is due to get married in three months, but Barfi is immediately smitten with Shruti. She also falls in love with Barfi, but Shruti's mother dissuades her from pursuing him because he could not take care of her with his disabilities and lack of money. Shruti unwillingly takes her mother's advice, marries Ranjeet, and leaves town, cutting off all contact with Barfi.

Meanwhile, Barfi's father suffers from kidney failure and Barfi is compelled to somehow raise the amount of [[Indian rupee|₹]]7000 for his surgery. After an unsuccessful attempt to rob a local bank, Barfi contemplates the kidnapping of Jhilmil Chatterjee, his autistic childhood friend and wealthy heiress of her grandfather's fortune, for a ransom. Upon arriving, Barfi discovers that Jhilmil has already been kidnapped and her father, Durjoy Chatterjee, files a police report and arranges a ransom of ₹50,000 as demanded. Barfi is escaping from Inspector Dutta from the bank robbery case and spots Jhilmil in a van. He sneaks inside and drives Jhilmil away from the ransom delivery. Barfi proceeds to hide her in his apartment with the police in pursuit. Barfi writes a new ransom note for ₹7000 and collects the amount from Jhilmil's father, but finds that his father has died just as he makes the hospital payment. Dejected, Barfi tries to leave Jhilmil at the village of her caretaker, but she refuses to leave him and the two soon move to [[Kolkata]], where Barfi assumes responsibility for Jhilmil and takes care of her.

===1978===
Six years later, Barfi and Shruti reunite by chance in Kolkata. Shruti is unhappy with her marriage with Ranjeet, and rekindles her friendship with Barfi, much to the chagrin of the lovestruck Jhilmil, who then goes missing in the city. Shruti files a missing person report for Jhilmil. Inspector Dutta and the Darjeeling police learn about the report, resume their pursuit of Barfi and arrest him. Shruti strives hard to help Barfi and Ranjeet abandons her as a result. As he is being interrogated, another ransom demand for Jhilmil is made and she is apparently killed in the process of the exchange, though her cadaver is never recovered. Inspector Dutta is confused that how come Jhilmil's father received a ransom note for her in Darjeeling when she was living in Kolkata for last six years. In order to conclude the case, the police decide to frame Barfi for Jhilmil's murder, but Inspector Dutta, who grew fond of Barfi after investigating him for his nuisances, asks Shruti to take him away, offering him a second chance at life. She agrees and hopes that now Jhilmil is dead, she can finally be with Barfi.

However, Barfi is deeply affected by Jhilmil's loss and finds living with Shruti unfulfilled. He eventually finds the location of Jhilmil's childhood home from the scribbles that she made in their house. Barfi takes Shruti to the place to find Jhilmil, and in a [[plot twist]], the two discover that Jhilmil is alive all along, and that both the kidnappings were fabricated by her father so that he could embezzle money from Jhilmil's [[Trust (law)|trust fund]]. In the second attempt, the second time, Jhilmil's caretakers from her childhood foster home colluded with Jhilmil's father and faked her death so that she could return to her special-care home, away from her alcoholic mother. In return, Jhilmil's father received control of the trust fund that Jhilmil's late grandfather had left behind for her. Barfi happily reunites with Jhilmil and the two get married, while Shruti spends the rest of her days alone, regretting the loss of her chance to be with Barfi, but still happy about Barfi and Jhilmil reuniting.

On the present day, Barfi is gravely ill in a [[hospital]] and is close to death. Jhilmil arrives and lies with Barfi in his [[hospital bed]] as Shruti narrates that the two died peacefully together, not wanting to leave each other behind in life or death. The film closes showing the last days of Barfi and Jhilmil as credits roll.","Comedy, Drama, Romance","starring       = [[Ranbir Kapoor]]<br>[[Priyanka Chopra]]<br>[[Ileana D'Cruz]]

218,Ford v Ferrari,"==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->
In 1963, [[Ford Motor Company]] Vice President [[Lee Iacocca]] proposes to [[Henry Ford II]] to boost their car sales by purchasing [[Ferrari]], dominant in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. Owner [[Enzo Ferrari]] uses Ford's offer to secure a deal with [[Fiat S.p.A.|Fiat]] that allows him to retain ownership of the firm's racing team, [[Scuderia Ferrari]], and insults Ford and his whole company. This leads Ford into ordering his racing division to build a car to compete against Ferrari at Le Mans, and Iacocca hiring [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby American]] owner [[Carroll Shelby]], a retired driver who won [[1959 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans in 1959]]. Shelby enlists his friend [[Ken Miles]], a hot-tempered English racing driver and mechanical engineer.

Shelby and Miles develop the UK-built [[Ford GT40#Mk I|Ford GT40 Mk I]] prototype at [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. At the launch of the new [[Ford Mustang]], Miles gives a witheringly rude appraisal of it to Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe. Beebe campaigns against sending Miles to the [[1965 24 Hours of Le Mans|upcoming race at Le Mans]] as a public relations liability. Shelby reluctantly excludes Miles and sends [[Phil Hill]] and [[Bruce McLaren]] to Le Mans; none of the Fords finish.

When Ford demands why he should not sack Shelby, Shelby explains that despite the GT40's reliability problems, it instilled fear in Enzo Ferrari by reaching 218&nbsp;mph (350.8 [[Kilometres per hour|km/h]]), on the [[Mulsanne Straight]] before breaking down. He says a race car cannot be designed by committee. Ford tells him to continue the project and report directly to him. During testing of the [[Ford GT40#Mk II|GT40 Mk II]], the recurrent problem of [[brake fade]] causes a crash and fire, which Miles survives. The team realizes the rules permit replacing the whole brake assembly during the race.

In 1966, Beebe takes over the racing division. When he and Ford arrive to inspect the program, Shelby locks Beebe in his office and gives Ford a ride in the GT40. Shelby makes an agreement with Ford: if Miles wins the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], then he will race at Le Mans. If not, Ford will take full ownership of Shelby American. At [[Daytona International Speedway]], Beebe enters a second GT40 supported by a [[NASCAR]] team with quicker pit stops. However, Shelby clears Miles to push his car beyond the 7,000 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] redline, and he wins.

At the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans|next race at Le Mans]], Miles struggles with a faulty door during the first lap. The pit crew fixes it and Miles sets lap records, catching the Ferraris. The GT40 suffers brake fade while dicing with the prototype [[Ferrari P|330 P3]] Ferrari of [[Lorenzo Bandini]], so Miles limps into the pits for replacement of the entire braking system. Ferrari protests but Shelby assures race officials it is legal.

Miles and Bandini duel on the Mulsanne Straight until the Ferrari breaks down, putting Bandini out of the race. With Fords in the top three positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other Fords to catch him and give the press a three-car [[photo finish]]. Shelby tells Miles what Beebe wants but says it is Miles's call. Miles initially continues to set new lap records, but decides to comply on the final lap.

McLaren is declared the winner as, having started behind Miles, his car traveled further overall. Miles is placed second. Shelby accuses Beebe of deliberately costing Miles the win, but an unusually sanguine Miles lets it pass, saying to Shelby, ""You promised me the drive, not the win."" From his vantage point, Enzo Ferrari tips his hat to Miles on the track. As they walk off together, Shelby tells Miles they will win Le Mans next time.

Two months later, during testing at [[Riverside International Raceway]], a mechanical failure in the [[Ford GT40#J-car|J-car]] kills Miles in a crash. Six months later, Shelby parks outside Miles's widow Mollie's house and hesitates. Miles's son Peter arrives and the two talk about Miles. Shelby gives Peter a wrench that Miles once threw at him in anger.

A textual epilogue text reveals Ford continued its Le Mans winning streak in [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans|1967]], [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans|1968]], and [[1969 24 Hours of Le Mans|1969]], and Miles was posthumously inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 2001.","Action, Biography, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!-- PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->

A poison-gas attack on a [[Kolkata Metro]] Rail compartment kills the passengers on board. Two years later, Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant [[British Indians|British-Indian]] [[software engineer]], arrives in [[Kolkata]] from [[London]] during the [[Durga Puja]] festivities in search of her missing husband, Arnab Bagchi. A police officer, Satyoki ""Rana"" Sinha, offers to help. Although Vidya claims that Arnab went to [[Kolkata]] on an assignment for the National Data Center (NDC), initial investigations suggest that no such person was employed by the NDC.

Agnes D'Mello, the NDC's head of human resources, suggests to Vidya that her husband resembled former employee Milan Damji, whose file is probably kept in the old NDC office. Before Agnes can provide any further help, she is killed by Bob Biswas, an assassin working undercover as a life insurance agent. Agnes is shot at the entrance of her house, before which she is seen enjoying some music. Vidya and Rana break into the NDC office and find Damji's file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is searching for the same information. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's records have attracted the attention of two [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] officials in [[Delhi]]—the chief Bhaskaran K. and his deputy Khan. Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was a rogue IB agent responsible for the poison gas attack. Despite Khan's warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji may have led him into trouble.

The address on Damji's record leads Vidya and Rana to a dilapidated flat. An errand boy from the neighbourhood tea stall identifies R. Sridhar, an NDC officer, as a frequent visitor to Damji's flat. Bob attempts, but fails, to kill Vidya and is soon run over by a truck during a chase. Examination of Bob's mobile phone leads Vidya and Rana to an IP address, sending instructions to kill her. They break into Sridhar's office to verify his IP address, but he is alerted electronically and returns to his office. Vidya accidentally kills Sridhar during a scuffle, which upsets Khan, who had wanted him alive.

Sridhar's computer data reveals a code, which when deciphered reveals Bhaskaran's phone number. Vidya calls Bhaskaran to tell him that she has retrieved sensitive documents from Sridhar's office. She asks Bhaskaran to help find her husband in exchange for the documents, but Bhaskaran tells her to contact the local police. Vidya soon gets a call from an unknown number, warning her that she should hand over the documents to the caller if she wishes to see her husband alive. Khan thinks the caller is Damji.

Vidya goes to meet Damji, followed by Rana and Khan. Damji cuts the meeting short when Vidya expresses her doubt that he will be able to return her husband in exchange for the sensitive file, and he attempts to leave. Vidya tries to stop him, and in the ensuing struggle, Damji draws a gun on her. Vidya disarms him using the prosthetic belly she has been using to fake her pregnancy and promptly stabbing him in the neck with her hairstick before finally killing him with his own gun. She flees into the crowd before the police arrive, leaving a thank-you note for Rana and a pen drive containing data from Sridhar's computer, which leads to Bhaskaran's arrest. Rana concludes that neither Vidya nor Arnab Bagchi ever existed and that Vidya had been using the police and the IB to achieve her own ends.

Vidya is revealed to be the widow of Major Arup Basu, an IB and Army officer and Damji's colleague, who was killed in the poison-gas attack, which also caused Vidya to immediately fall unconscious upon seeing her husband's corpse and suffer a miscarriage. In her mission to avenge his and their unborn child's deaths, Vidya was helped by the retired IB officer, Col. Pratap Bajpayee, who suspected the involvement of a top IB official.","Mystery, Thriller","starring       = {{ubl|[[Vidya Balan]]|[[Parambrata Chatterjee]]|[[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]|[[Indraneil Sengupta]]|[[Saswata Chatterjee]]}}

222,Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara,"== Plot ==
Kabir Dewan ([[Abhay Deol]]), an [[architect]] at his father's [[construction]] company in [[Mumbai]], gets engaged to his girlfriend, Natasha Arora ([[Kalki Koechlin]]), who is an [[interior designer]]. Before their marriage, Kabir plans a three-week [[road trip]] [[bachelor party]] in [[Spain]] with his two childhood friends: Imran Qureshi ([[Farhan Akhtar]]), an [[advertising]] [[copywriter]] in [[Delhi]]; and Arjun Saluja ([[Hrithik Roshan]]), a successful [[investment banker]] in [[London]]. The trio has a long-standing pact that during the road trip, each of them will pick a surprise [[adventure sport]] that they all have to participate in together. Arjun is initially reluctant to take the trip for being too tied up with work, but eventually agrees after much emotional blackmailing. Meanwhile, Imran secretly plans to find his [[Family estrangement|estranged]] biological father in Spain, after discovering [[Letter (message)|letters]] from his late stepfather, Faisal Qureshi, although his [[widow]]ed mother, Rahila ([[Deepti Naval]]), resists the thought and states that it was only Faisal who should be considered his real father. 

The trio flies to Spain separately and meets in [[Barcelona]]. They plan to visit [[Costa Brava]], [[Seville]] and [[Pamplona]]. While there, Imran takes Kabir out to find an [[art gallery]] where they come across the work of Salman Habib, an [[artist]] who resides in Spain. On their way to Costa Brava, Imran and Kabir are annoyed when Arjun [[Workaholic|continues working]]. While Arjun is [[driving]] and answering a [[phone call]] related to work simultaneously, Imran casually grabs his [[mobile phone]] from his hand and throws it out of their moving car through the window, which results in a [[physical altercation]]. Arjun, in a fit of rage, accuses Imran of being unapologetic for being involved four years prior with Arjun's then-girlfriend, Sonali. However, Kabir stops the argument and advises them not to bring Sonali up as she was the main reason why the trip was cancelled four years prior. After reaching Costa Brava, the trio meets Laila ([[Katrina Kaif]]), an [[Anglo-Indian]] woman studying [[fashion design]], whom Arjun is immediately attracted to, but Imran flirts with her and makes Arjun jealous. 

Kabir informs his friends that his choice of sport is [[underwater diving]], and the trio later finds out that Laila is their [[diving instructor]]. Arjun, who cannot [[Swimming|swim]] and is [[Aquaphobia|aquaphobic]], receives assistance from Laila to overcome his fears, and finishes the sport successfully, gaining a new perspective of life. Laila then invites the trio to attend the [[La Tomatina]] festival with her in [[Buñol]], interfering with Arjun's planned activity, but he accepts. Meanwhile, Natasha becomes suspicious that Kabir is involved with Laila after she sees her on a [[Videotelephony|video call]] with him. Kabir tries to explain that Laila is just a friend who has been invited over to the trio's [[villa]] for dinner, but Natasha refuses to believe him. She crashes the bachelor party trip, much to Kabir's discomfort. Imran spends time with Laila's friend, Nuria ([[Ariadna Cabrol]]), and Arjun with Laila, even opening up to Laila on his past. After the trio leaves for Seville, both Arjun and Laila realise they have fallen in love. Not to regret their parting, Laila pursues them on a [[motorbike]] and shares a passionate kiss with Arjun before bidding farewell. Arjun now feels much more at peace with himself, and Natasha is relieved of her suspicions about Kabir. 

On their way to Seville, Kabir drops Natasha off at the [[airport]], while Arjun and Imran discuss Kabir's change in behaviour around Natasha. The trio then arrives at Seville to go [[skydiving]], which is Arjun's choice of sport. During the task, Imran is forced to confront his [[acrophobia]] and hesitates to take part, but does so nevertheless. After skydiving, the trio visits a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] and becomes [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]]. After a childish prank on a stranger backfires, they are [[arrest]]ed and held in custody by the police, until Imran reveals to his friends that Salman is his father. Imran calls Salman, who [[bail]]s them out and takes them to his home. In an in-person conversation with Imran, Salman is proud of his biological son's hidden writing talent, but reveals that he never wanted the responsibility of married life or children while Rahila did. Imran realises that Salman still does not feel apologetic for abandoning Rahila and their unborn child, and storms out with a final request to Salman that he must apologise to him only when it is genuine. Realising how his actions must have hurt Arjun four years ago, Imran sincerely apologises to him, and Arjun, appreciating the genuineness of his apology, forgives Imran with a hug.

On reaching Pamplona, the trio learns about the [[running of the bulls]], which is Imran's choice of sport, baffling Kabir and Arjun. Imran calls Laila, who joins them in Pamplona. When confronted by his friends, Kabir reveals that he had actually [[Marriage proposal|proposed]] to Natasha by accident: he had purchased a [[Ring (jewellery)|ring]] as a birthday gift for his mother, and while showing it to Natasha during the celebration, she had misunderstood it for an [[engagement ring]]. Kabir eventually played along, spurred on by his family's approval. Arjun realises why this trip was so important to Kabir as no one apart from his friends would advise him to cancel his marriage. On the morning of the bull run, Imran suggests that they make another pact for if they survive the event: Imran vows to publish his secret [[poetry]], Arjun vows to follow Laila to [[Morocco]] and live to the fullest, and Kabir vows to confess to Natasha that he is not willing to marry her. The trio completes the event successfully, gaining a renewed sense of life. In the [[epilogue]], Imran, Kabir, Nuria and Natasha attend Arjun and Laila's marriage. Kabir and Natasha are no longer together, but are still friends, and Natasha introduces Kabir to her new partner, while Imran's poetry is revealed to have been published.","Comedy, Drama","starring       = [[Hrithik Roshan]]<br />[[Abhay Deol]]<br />Farhan Akhtar<br />[[Katrina Kaif]]<br />[[Kalki Koechlin]]

When Joe realises his five wives are fleeing in the Rig, he leads his entire army in pursuit, calling on his allies to help.

Nux joins the pursuit with Max strapped to his car, and a chasing battle ensues. After entering enemy territory and fending off a rival gang, Furiosa drives into a sandstorm and loses all of her pursuers except Nux, who attempts to [[Suicide attack|sacrifice himself]] to blow up the Rig. Max frees himself and restrains Nux, and Furiosa destroys Nux's car.

After the sandstorm, Max catches Furiosa repairing the Rig, accompanied by Joe's wives: Toast, Capable, the Dag, Cheedo, and Angharad, the last of whom is heavily pregnant with Joe's child. Max fights and subdues Furiosa, but her engine [[kill switch]] prevents him from stealing the Rig. He begrudgingly agrees to help Furiosa's group escape Joe's wrath. Nux sneaks onto the Rig and attempts to kill Furiosa, but the wives overpower him and throw him out. He rejoins Joe's army when it catches up.

Furiosa drives through a canyon controlled by a [[biker gang]], having pre-arranged to trade petrol for safe passage. The bikers turn on her when they spot Joe's army approaching, forcing her to flee. The bikers detonate the canyon walls to block Joe and then pursue the Rig as Max and Furiosa fend them off. Joe drives over the blockade in a [[monster truck]] and catches up with the Rig. He sends Nux to carjack the Rig, but Nux fails, to Joe's disgust. While helping Max, Angharad falls off the Rig and Joe fatally runs her over.

Capable finds Nux hiding in the Rig and consoles him as he laments his failure. At night, Furiosa and Max drive through a swamp and get stuck in the mud. They slow Joe's forces with landmines, but the Bullet Farmer continues the pursuit in his [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]]. Furiosa and Max work together to blind the Bullet Farmer and disable his ATV. Moved by Capable's compassion, Nux joins the group and helps get the Rig moving again.

In the morning, Furiosa tells Max that her group is escaping to a ""Green Place"", the bountiful land where she grew up before she was kidnapped and brought to the Citadel. She spots a Green Place watchtower and identifies herself to the watchwoman, who summons their matriarchal clan, the Vuvalini. The Vuvalini recognise Furiosa as one of their own, but inform a devastated Furiosa that the Green Place was the now-uninhabitable swamp from the previous night, and that there are only seven Vuvalini left. The group decides to ride across an immense [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flat]], hoping to find a new home on the other side. Max goes his own way.

After seeing a vision of a child he failed to save,<ref>''Mad Max: Fury Road: Max Comic'' (vol. 1) #1</ref><ref>''Mad Max: Fury Road: Max Comic'' (vol. 1) #2</ref> Max catches up with the group and convinces them to return to the Citadel, since they do not know what lies beyond the salt flat but do know that the now-undefended Citadel has ample water and crops. Joe intercepts them, and in the ensuing battle, five Vuvalini are killed, Toast is captured, and Furiosa is severely wounded. Joe overtakes the Rig as they approach the canyon. While Max fights Joe's son and enforcer, Rictus, Furiosa boards Joe's truck to rescue Toast, who distracts Joe, allowing Furiosa to kill him. The remnants of the group drive Joe's truck back to the Citadel, while Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the Rig to block the canyon behind them, killing Rictus. Max transfuses his blood to Furiosa, saving her life.

Back at the Citadel, the people rejoice upon learning of Joe's death. As Max's companions are lifted to Joe's cliffside fortress, Max exchanges a glance with Furiosa before disappearing into the crowd.","Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--- Per poster billing. --->

226,Gran Torino,"==Plot==
Recently widowed Walt Kowalski is a cantankerous and prejudiced [[Korean War]] veteran and retired [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] factory worker. His [[Rust Belt]] neighborhood in [[Metro Detroit]] has become ridden with [[gang violence]] and poor [[Hmong people|Hmong]] immigrants, including Walt's next-door neighbors, the Vang Lor family. Walt is estranged from his spoiled family, and on his 80th birthday, enragedly rejects his son's suggestion that he move to a [[retirement community]] in favor of living alone with his elderly [[Labrador Retriever|labrador]] Daisy. A chronic [[tobacco use]]r, Walt suffers from coughing fits, occasionally spitting up blood. As Walt's late wife requested, her priest, Father Janovich, tries to comfort Walt and persuade him to go to [[Confessional|confession]]. Despite being harshly rejected by Walt, Father Janovich repeatedly tries to get through to him.

15-year-old Thao Vang Lor is coerced by a Hmong gang led by his cousin, ""Spider"", to steal Walt's 1972 Ford Torino as an initiation. Walt catches Thao and thwarts the theft; Thao escapes after Walt nearly shoots him. When the gang tries to abduct Thao forcefully, Walt scares them off with his [[M1 Garand]] rifle, earning the local Hmong community's respect. Thao's mother makes him work for Walt as penance, who has him do different tasks to improve the local neighborhood. The two soon form a grudging mutual respect; Walt mentors Thao, helping him obtain a construction job. Walt also rescues Thao's sister, Sue, from the unwanted advances of three [[African Americans|African American]] gangsters. Despite his initial prejudices, Walt bonds with the Vang Lor family. With his cough worsening, Walt consults a doctor who gives him a gloomy prognosis that he conceals.

After the gang assaults Thao on his way home from work, Walt physically assaults a member as a warning. In retaliation, the gang beats and rapes Sue and then injures Thao in a [[drive-by shooting]]. The family refuses to report the crimes out of fear. The following day, an enraged Thao seeks Walt's help to exact revenge; Walt convinces him to return later that day. Walt buys a suit, gets a haircut, and finally confesses to Father Janovich. 

When Thao arrives, Walt takes him to his basement and gives him his [[Silver Star]], telling him that he is haunted by the memory of killing an enemy child soldier who was trying to surrender to him, and he wants to spare Thao from shedding blood. He locks Thao in the basement and departs to the gang's residence. 

When Walt arrives, the gang draws their guns on him as he berates them for their crimes, drawing the attention of the neighbors. Walt puts a cigarette in his mouth, slowly reaches into his jacket pocket, and pulls his hand out quickly. Thinking Walt is brandishing a pistol, the gang members shoot and kill him. Walt's hand opens to reveal his [[Zippo]] lighter with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry]] insignia. Following Walt's directions, Sue frees Thao, and they arrive at the scene. A police officer tells Thao and Sue that Walt was unarmed and that the gang members have been arrested for murder. The officer goes on to say to them that the gang members will be going to prison for a very long time, thanks to the fact that witnesses have come forward. 

Father Janovich conducts Walt's funeral, which his family and the Hmong community attend. Afterward, Walt's [[last will and testament]] is read. Much to the dismay of Walt's family, Walt leaves his house to the church and his cherished Gran Torino to Thao, on the condition that Thao does not modify the car. Sometime later, Thao drives the Torino along [[Jefferson Avenue (Detroit)|Detroit's Jefferson Avenue]] with Daisy at his side.",Drama,"starring       = Clint Eastwood<!-- per poster -->

229,Hachi: A Dog's Tale,"== Plot ==
Ronnie says to his class that his personal hero is his grandfather Parker Wilson's dog Hachi, whose story he starts narrating.

Parker Wilson, a professor who commutes to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]], finds a [[dog]] lost on the railway station in Bedridge and temporarily takes it home. The dog remains unclaimed but grows close to Parker, who takes it everywhere with him. Parker's Japanese friend Ken says the dog is a breed called Akita and the character on its collar tag is ""Hachi"" (""Eight"" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]). Parker thus names the dog ""Hachi"" as it is a lucky number. Parker's wife Cate Wilson eventually warms to Hachi but he sleeps outside in his own shed. Parker tries in vain to train Hachi in normal dog things like fetching a [[ball]]. However, Ken explains that Akita dogs cannot be trained; if Hachi fetches the ball, it will be for a special reason. Hachi digs under the fence and follows Parker to the station. He refuses to go home, and Parker misses the train. He hands him over to Cate and catches the next train. At 5:00 pm, he returns from the train and is surprised to find Hachi waiting for him at the station. He is even more surprised to learn that he came to the station all by himself. A daily routine begins: the two walk to the station, Parker leaves from the train, Hachi goes home, and returns at 5:00pm to receive Parker. Later, Parker's daughter Andy marries Michael, and Hachi is in the family marriage photograph. Soon after the marriage, Andy announces that she is pregnant.

However, one morning, Hachi behaves strangely at home and then follows Parker to the railway station with the ball. Parker throws the ball toward him, and much to his delight, Hachi fetches it for the first time. They play for a while, and Parker eventually puts the ball in his pocket and begins to leave. Hachi barks and watches Parker's train leaving. Hours later, while still holding the ball, Parker suffers a fatal [[stroke]] in his classroom and collapses; Hachi waits for him at the railway station. At 9:30pm, Michael comes to the railway station and takes Hachi home. From his shed, Hachi watches the family mourning Parker. The next morning, Parker's family members and friends gather for his funeral while Hachi goes to the station to wait. Soon, Cate sells the house and moves away, and Hachi goes to live with Andy and Michael and their infant son Ronnie. However, Hachi follows the train tracks to Bedridge. Andy and Michael find him and take him back to their house. Realizing that Hachi is pining for Parker, Andy opens the gate for him. Hachi licks her hand and runs back to the Bedridge station. Hachi waits at the station every day, while hot-dog seller Jasjeet and the other passers-by feed him. Soon, a reporter writes a story about Hachi, and people start sending him money and cards. Ken reads Hachi's news, travels to Bedridge and speaks to Hachi in Japanese: he too misses his best friend. On Parker's tenth death anniversary, Cate arrives in town to visit his grave, where Ken is present, too. She is moved to see an elderly Hachi still waiting at the station for his master. Later, Cate tells 10-year-old Ronnie the story of Hachi, who slowly settles in place. Hachi later passes away at his place in the station, while still waiting for Parker who finally comes to seek him in death and they at last reunite, in the afterlife.

In the present, Ronnie says that his grandfather and Hachi taught him the meaning of ""loyalty"", which means ""you should never forget anyone you have loved"". He concludes that Hachi will forever be his personal hero and the class applauds. From the school bus, Ronnie is met by Michael and a tiny new puppy who is also named Hachi. Ronnie and the puppy travel through the same tracks Hachi traveled years ago.","Biography, Drama, Family","starring       = [[Richard Gere]]<br />[[Joan Allen]]<br />[[Erick Avari]]<br />[[Jason Alexander]]

230,Mary and Max,"==Plot==
In 1976, eight-year-old Mary Daisy Dinkle lives a lonely life in [[Mount Waverley, Victoria|Mount Waverley]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia. Her classmates tease her because of a birthmark on her forehead. Her distant father, Noel, and alcoholic, [[kleptomaniac]] mother, Vera, provide little support. Her only comforts are her pet rooster, Ethel; her favourite food, sweetened [[condensed milk]]; and a [[The Smurfs|Smurfs]]-like cartoon show called ''The Noblets''. While at the post office with her mother, Mary spots a [[New York City]] telephone book and, curious about Americans, decides to write to one. She randomly chooses Max Jerry Horowitz from the phone book and sends him a letter telling him about herself.

Max is a [[Obesity-associated morbidity|morbidly obese]] 44-year-old [[Jewish atheist]] who has trouble forming relationships due to various mental and social problems. Mary's letter initially gives him an [[anxiety attack]], but he writes back, and the two become friends (partly due to their shared love of chocolate and ''The Noblets''). Vera disapproves of Max, so Mary tells him to send his letters to her [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] neighbour, Len Hislop. Mary asks Max about [[Romance (love)|love]], and he suffers a severe anxiety attack, being institutionalised for eight months. He wins the [[New York Lottery]] and buys a lifetime supply of chocolate and the entire collection of Noblet figurines. He gives the remainder to his elderly neighbour, Ivy, who pampers herself before dying in an accident. Mary becomes despondent, thinking Max has abandoned her.

Max finally writes back to Mary, explaining he has been diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]]. The two continue their correspondence for the next several years. When Noel retires, he takes up [[metal detector|metal detecting]] and is swept away by a large [[tidal bore]] while on a beach. The now-adult Mary goes to the [[University of Melbourne]]. She has her birthmark removed and develops a crush on her neighbour, Damien Popodopoulos. Vera accidentally kills herself after she drinks [[Embalming chemicals|embalming fluid]] instead of [[Classification of wine#Other styles|cooking sherry]]. Mary and Damien later marry.

Mary studies [[psychology]] and writes her doctoral dissertation on Asperger syndrome with Max as her case study. She sends Max a copy, and he is infuriated, believing she has taken advantage of him. He breaks off communication with Mary by removing the letter ""M"" from his typewriter. Mary has the entire run of her book [[pulped]], ending her career. She becomes [[major depressive disorder|depressed]] and begins drinking. She finds a can of condensed milk and sends it to Max as an apology. She finds a letter from Damien informing her that he has left her for his pen pal, Desmond.

After nearly choking a homeless man in anger (all because he threw a [[cigarette]] on the ground), Max realizes everyone is imperfect like himself. He sends Mary his Noblet figurine collection as a gesture of forgiveness. Mary fails to find the box on her doorstep for several days. Unaware she is pregnant, Mary decides to commit [[suicide]]. Having finally conquered his [[agoraphobia]], Len alerts her of Max's package. A letter from Max tells her of his realisation that they are not perfect. He also states how much their friendship means to him and hopes their paths will cross one day.

Mary travels to New York with her infant child to visit Max. Mary discovers Max dead on his couch, gazing upward and smiling. Mary finds all the letters she sent Max over the years taped to the ceiling. Seeing how much Max valued their friendship, Mary cries tears of joy as she sits beside him on the couch.","Animation, Comedy, Drama","starring       = [[Toni Collette]]<br>[[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]<br>[[Eric Bana]]

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be 400-700 words for feature films -->
In 1980, hitman [[Anton Chigurh]] is arrested in Texas. He escapes by strangling the sheriff's deputy and steals a car by killing the driver with a [[captive bolt pistol]]. Later, he spares the life of a [[gas station]] owner for correctly calling a [[coin toss]].

Meanwhile, Llewelyn Moss is hunting [[pronghorns]] in the desert. He comes across the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong. He finds several dead men, a wounded Mexican man begging for water, and cache of drugs in a truck.  Following the blood trail of ""the last man standing"" he finds him, now dead from his wounds under a tree beside a briefcase containing $2.4 million in cash. He takes the briefcase and returns home. Feeling guilty, he returns with water that night, but finds the man dead of new gunshot wounds. He looks up to the ridge and sees two men with guns who pursue him in a truck. He escapes into a river, shooting the men's dog as it chases him. After making his way back home, Moss sends his wife, Carla Jean, to stay with her mother.

Chigurh is hired to recover the missing money; meanwhile, [[Terrell County, Texas|Terrell County]] Sheriff Ed Tom Bell begins investigating the failed drug deal. Chigurh searches Moss' trailer home, using his bolt pistol to blow out the door lock. Moss takes a taxi to a motel in [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]], where he hides the briefcase in his room's air duct. Following a tracking device hidden in the case, Chigurh goes to Moss' motel and kills three Mexican mobsters. Moss has rented a second room adjacent to the Mexicans' room with access to the duct where the money is hidden. He retrieves the briefcase before Chigurh opens the duct.

Moving to a hotel in the border town of [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]], Moss discovers the tracking device, but Chigurh has already found him. Their firefight spills onto the streets, badly wounding both and killing a truck driver. Moss flees to Mexico, hiding the case along the Rio Grande. A [[Norteño (music)|norteño]] band takes Moss to a hospital. Chigurh cleans and stitches his wounds with stolen supplies. Carson Wells, a bounty hunter, offers Moss protection in exchange for the money, but he refuses. Chigurh ambushes Wells at his hotel. The phone rings as Wells is bartering for his life. Chigurh shoots him and takes the call from Moss, vowing to kill Carla Jean unless Moss gives up the money.

Moss retrieves the case from the Rio Grande and arranges to meet Carla Jean at a motel in [[El Paso]], where he plans to give her the money and hide her from danger. Carla Jean's mother unknowingly reveals Moss' location to a group of Mexicans tailing them. Bell reaches the motel in El Paso, only to find that the Mexicans have killed Moss. Carla Jean arrives later and bursts into tears when Bell somberly removes his hat.

That night, Bell returns to the crime scene and observes the lock blown out. Bell thinks that Chigurh is hiding, but when Bell hesitantly enters, he finds the room empty. Later, Bell visits his cousin Ellis and tells him he plans to retire because he feels overmatched by the recent violence. Ellis tells Bell of a story in which a lawman, Ellis' uncle, was killed on his porch and says that the region has always been violent.

Carla Jean returns from her mother's funeral to find Chigurh waiting in the bedroom. Chigurh says he must fulfill his vow, but offers a coin toss as a compromise. Carla Jean refuses to call it, saying that he will be responsible for her fate.<!-- Please do not describe off-screen events. --> Chigurh checks the soles of his boots as he leaves the house. As he drives through the neighborhood, another car crashes into him, breaking his arm. He asks a passing boy for a shirt to use as a sling and flees on foot.

Now retired, Bell shares two dreams with his wife. In the first, he lost some money his father had given him. In the other, as he rode through a snowy mountain pass, his father rode past him to prepare a campfire ahead.","Crime, Drama, Thriller","starring       = {{Plain list|

234,Lage Raho Munna Bhai,"== Plot ==
[[Munna Bhai|Murliprasad Sharma, alias Munna Bhai]] is a street-wise gangster, smitten by a [[radio jockey]], Jahnvi, who hosts a morning show. After winning a contest hosted by her station through his men, he gets to meet her in-person for an interview on [[Gandhi Jayanti]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s birthday. To impress Jahnvi, Munna poses as a college professor specializing in [[Gandhism]] and claims he lives by Gandhi's principles of [[truth]] and [[non-violent]] resistance. Jahnvi owns a large property called the Second Innings House, which serves as a senior-citizen home. She invites Munna to lecture the seniors. To prepare, Munna spends five days in a library reading about Gandhi. On the fifth day, he starts [[hallucinating]] and seeing visions of Gandhi, who also speaks to him. Munna's sidekick, Circuit, accompanies him to a psychiatrist but prevents the doctor from revealing to Munna that he is ill and mentally exhausted. Convinced Gandhi is actually there, Munna delivers a successful lecture and impresses Janhvi.

Lucky Singh, an unscrupulous businessman who employs Circuit and Munna to conduct ""[[Mumbai underworld|underworld]]"" activities for him, learns about Munna's love for Janhvi and offers to help by funding a trip to [[Goa, India|Goa]] for all the senior citizens. During the trip, Munna tries to propose to Jahnvi; however, they discover the trip was a ruse for Lucky to occupy the house. It turns out that Lucky's daughter, Simran, is engaged to Sunny, the son of Khurana, a powerful businessman. Khurana is superstitious and his activities are controlled by his [[astrologer]], Batuk Maharaj. Maharaj's particular use of [[numerology]] led Khurana to add an extra ""k"" to his name and further convinced him that ""Second Innings House"" would be the most auspicious place for the new couple to live, hence the seizure. Further, Batuk initially advised Khurana to not go through with the wedding since, unbeknownst to Simran, she is revealed to be a [[Mangal Dosha|manglik]] and would pass bad luck to Sunny. Lucky, not wanting to lose such an alliance, covers this up by saying that there was a mistake at the time of Simran's birth, and hence the alliance progresses. 

With the authorities and lawyers not willing to confront Lucky, Munna comes up with a Gandhi-inspired approach. He starts co-hosting a radio show with Jahnvi, where he solves ordinary listeners' everyday problems with [[satyagraha|Gandhi principles]], with his request that they send Lucky flowers to help him recover from the ""disease of dishonesty"" in exchange for a unique, non-violent protest. The show becomes successful, and pressure mounts on Lucky to return the home. Meanwhile, on Gandhi’s insistence, Munna writes a letter to Janhvi revealing the truth about him. Heartbroken, she leaves him and quits the radio show, but Munna continues his struggle against Lucky. However, he receives another setback when Lucky hosts a press conference to declare Munna mentally ill, supported by Munna's psychiatrist. Convinced Gandhi was only in his imagination, Munna decides to leave the city with Circuit but decides to host his last radio segment, holding the studio hostage. Elsewhere, on Simran’s wedding day, she learns about her father's deception of Khurana and runs away, ending up in a cab of a taxi driver, Victor D’Souza, who was helped by Munna in his radio show. Victor connects her to Munna, where she explains her dilemma. Munna convinces her to go back to wedding and tell the truth. When Khurana rejects her, Munna and Circuit crash the wedding and confront Batuk. Sunny decides he wants to marry her nonetheless, but Munna and Circuit are arrested for causing a disturbance. 

At the police station, Jahnvi reconciles with Munna. Lucky, grateful, bails him out and returns the keys to Jahnvi's house. Munna and Jahnvi eventually marry and continue hosting their radio show on Gandhism, affectionately called ''Gandhigiri''. A senior couple from the house adopt Circuit and his mannerisms; Victor achieves success and makes his father proud; Simran and Sunny, happily married, have a child; and Khurana fires Batuk and removes the extra “k” from his name, thus denouncing his belief in numerology. Meanwhile, a reformed Lucky sits in the same library in which Munna sat, reading about Gandhi, and Gandhi begins to appear to him too.","Comedy, Drama, Romance","starring       = {{Plainlist|

235,Million Dollar Baby,"==Plot==
Margaret ""Maggie"" Fitzgerald, a waitress from the [[Ozarks]], enters the Hit Pit, a rundown boxing gym in Los Angeles operated by Frankie Dunn. Dunn is a cantankerous Irish-American trainer, estranged from his daughter. Maggie asks Frankie to train her, but he refuses because he does not want to train women and believes Maggie is too old. Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, Frankie's friend and the gym's handyman, allows her to train at the Hit Pit regardless. Frankie's prize prospect, ""Big Willie"" Little, signs with rival manager Mickey Mack after becoming impatient with Frankie rejecting offers for a championship bout, so Maggie gets her chance.

Maggie fights her way up in the women's amateur boxing division with Frankie's coaching. Since she has earned a reputation for quick knockouts, Frankie bribes managers to put their trainee fighters against her. Scrap, concerned when Frankie rejects several offers for big fights, arranges a meeting for Maggie with Mack, but out of loyalty to Frankie, she declines. Frankie bestows Maggie a Gaelic nickname, embroidered on her boxing robe, [[Macushla|''Mo Chuisle'']], but does not tell her its meaning. The two travel to Europe as she continues to win. Maggie eventually saves enough of her winnings to buy her mother a house, but her mother berates Maggie for endangering her welfare checks, claiming that everyone back home is laughing at her.

Frankie is finally willing to arrange a title fight. He secures Maggie a $1 million match in Las Vegas against the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] women's welterweight champion, Billie ""the Blue Bear"" Osterman, a German ex-prostitute who has a reputation as a dirty fighter. Maggie begins to dominate the fight, but Billie knocks her out with an illegal [[sucker punch]] from behind after the bell rings to end the round. Maggie lands hard on her corner stool, breaking her neck and leaving her a ventilator-dependent [[Tetraplegia|quadriplegic]].

Frankie goes through the [[five stages of grief]], seeking multiple doctors' opinions in denial, lashing out in anger at Scrap, and trying to bargain with God through prayer. He later apologizes to Scrap and blames himself for Maggie's injuries. Scrap tells him not to as Maggie owed it to him for getting her shot at the world championship.

While in the hospital, Maggie looks forward to a visit from her family. They arrive late, having first toured [[Disneyland]] and [[Universal Studios Hollywood]]. Accompanied by an attorney, their sole concern is to get Maggie's assets transferred to them. Disgusted, she orders them to leave and threatens to report their [[welfare fraud]] if they try to contact her again.

Maggie develops bedsores and undergoes an amputation for an infected leg. She asks Frankie to help her die, declaring that she had everything she wanted out of life. A horrified Frankie refuses, so Maggie later bites her own tongue in an attempt to bleed to death. Knowing the fatherly affection Frankie has developed for Maggie, Frankie's priest warns him that he would never find himself again if he were to go through with Maggie's request. Frankie sneaks into the hospital one night, unaware that Scrap is watching from the shadows.

236,Hotel Rwanda,"==Plot==
In April 1994, tensions between the [[Hutu]]-controlled government and [[Tutsi]] rebels led to [[Rwandan genocide|genocide in Rwanda]], where corruption and bribes between politicians were routine. [[Paul Rusesabagina]], manager of the Belgian-owned [[Hôtel des Mille Collines]], is Hutu, but his wife Tatiana is Tutsi. Their marriage is a source of friction with Hutu extremists, including [[Georges Rutaganda]], a goods supplier to the hotel who is also the local leader of [[Interahamwe]], a brutal Hutu militia.
Paul curries favor with [[Rwandan Army]]  general [[Augustin Bizimungu]], who favors the Hutu. Following the [[Assassination of Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|assassination]] of the [[Juvénal Habyarimana|president]], a Hutu, Paul and his family observe neighbors being killed, initiating the early stages of the genocide. When [[Rwandan Civil War|civil war]] erupts and a [[Rwandan Army]] Captain threatens Paul and his neighbors, Paul barely negotiates their safety and brings them to the hotel. Upon returning with them, he finds his insolent receptionist Gregoire occupying the presidential suite and threatening to expose the Tutsi refugees, including Paul's wife, if he is made to work.

The UN peacekeeping forces, led by Canadian Colonel Oliver, are forbidden to intervene in the conflict and prevent the genocide. Paul's boss and owner of the hotel, who lives in Belgium, apologizes to him over the phone, saying there's nothing he can do to provide safe passage for him and his family. The foreign nationals are evacuated, but the Rwandans are left behind to fend for themselves.
More evacuees arrive at the hotel from the overburdened United Nations refugee camp, the [[Red Cross]], and various orphanages, totaling 800, both Tutsi and Hutu. Tatiana desperately searches for her brother, sister-in-law, and two nieces. As the situation becomes more violent, Paul must divert the Hutu soldiers, care for the refugees, protect his family, and maintain the appearance of a functioning 4-star hotel. Paul forces Gregoire to work with the help of General Bizimungu.

Low on supplies, Paul and Gregoire drive to collect hotel supplies from Georges Rutaganda and witness the Interahamwe militia raping Tutsi hostages. Georges explains to Paul that the ""rich cockroaches"" money will become worthless since all of the Tutsis will be killed. Paul expresses disbelief that the Hutu extremists will wipe out all of the Tutsis, but Georges replies: ""Why not? We are halfway there already."" They return to the hotel through the dark, thick fog, on the riverside road recommended by Georges, only to find it is carpeted with dead bodies.

When the UN forces attempt to evacuate a group of refugees, including Paul's family, Gregoire betrays them to the Interahamwe, who use radio broadcasts to accost them. After giving General Bizimungu the remaining valuables and Scotch from his office safe to protect the refugees, Paul then admonishes Bizimungu for genocide apathy and promises to testify on his behalf for his help.
Soon afterward, Paul's family and the hotel refugees are finally able to leave the besieged hotel in a UN convoy. They travel through retreating masses of refugees and militia to reach safety behind [[Rwandan Patriotic Front|Tutsi rebel]] lines and are reunited with their nieces.

The end title cards explain that Paul saved at least 1,200 Tutsi and Hutu refugees. He and his family, who adopted the two nieces, moved to [[Belgium]], but Tatiana's brother Thomas and his wife were never found. The genocide came to an end in July 1994 when the Tutsi rebels drove the Hutu and the Interahamwe militia across the border into the Congo. At least 800,000 people died in the genocide. Georges and Bizimungu were tried and sentenced for war crimes, with Georges receiving a life sentence.","Biography, Drama, History","starring       = {{Plainlist|

Nine years after meeting Céline in Vienna,{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Before Sunrise]]'' (1995)}} Jesse has written a bestselling novel, ''This Time'', based on their time together. During a book tour in Europe, he does a reading at [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]], where three journalists interview him: one is convinced the novel's characters meet again, another that they do not, and a third who wants them to but is doubtful that will occur. Céline also attends the reading.

Required to leave for the airport in an hour, Jesse and Céline use the time to roam Paris. Their conversations soon become deeply personal, and they passionately discuss work, politics and lament their failure to meet again in Vienna or exchange contact details. Céline informs she did not return as her grandmother died, and Jesse claims that he did not return either; after Céline asks him why he did not, he confesses that he did return.

They reveal how their lives have changed in the nine years apart: Jesse is married and has a son named Hank, while Céline works for an environmental non-governmental organization and is in a relationship with a photojournalist. Their old romantic feelings become slowly rekindled while walking around Paris. Jesse says his novel was inspired by the hope of seeing Céline again, and she says that reading it caused painful memories. They both admit that their previous night together had profoundly affected their perceptions of love, leading to dissatisfaction in both of their lives as Céline has had difficulty maintaining relationships while Jesse’s marriage is deeply strained.

Céline and Jesse arrive at her apartment, even after continuous insistence that Jesse should not miss his flight. Jesse persuades her to play a waltz on her guitar, which she wrote about their encounter in Vienna.

239,Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.,"== Plot ==

Murliprasad Sharma is a gangster in [[Mumbai]], known by the title '[[Munna Bhai]]' (''""bhai""'' means brother or don in the [[Bombay Hindi|local dialect]]), who runs an extortion racket. Every year, with the help of his aide Sarkeshwar ""Circuit"" Sharma and his gang, he converts his hide-out into a fully-functioning hospital to fool Munna's visiting parents Hariprasad and Parvati, who believe Munna is a real doctor.

Meanwhile, one of Hari's annual visits with Parvati culminates in Hari bumping into his friend Dr. Jagdish Asthana, who is the dean of a local medical college. Hari proposes to Asthana that they get his daughter and Munna's childhood friend ""Chinki"" married to him. Asthana agrees, even though Munna asks her to reject him, lest his parents discover the truth. However, when his maid reacts shockingly to Munna's photo, Asthana realizes the truth and exposes Munna to Hari and Parvati. Humiliated at their son's lack of a real vocation, they leave the city and return home. Munna vows to become a doctor to get back at Asthana but unknowingly ends up enrolling into his college with the help of home surgeon Dr. Rustom Pawri. Certain that Munna has cheated his way through the entrance exam, but lacking real evidence, he is forced to allow Munna to study there.

Upon becoming a student, Munna falls back into his ways by enforcing his regime of ""common-sense treatment"", directly challenging Asthana's conventional opinions to get under his skin. Despite the school's emphasis on mechanical, cartesian, impersonal, and often bureaucratic relationships between doctors and patients, Munna, who constantly seeks to impose a more empathetic and almost holistic regimen around himself, clashes with professors over their lack of empathy towards patients, especially those who are deemed incurable by conventional medicine. His behavior is well-received by the hospital staff and patients, who are able to see the good-natured intent behind his anti-establishment actions. Asthana, perceiving this as chaos, is unable to stop it and resorts to [[laughter therapy]] to deal with his stress. 

Munna simultaneously develops a friendly relationship with Dr. Suman, who works at the hospital, unaware that she is ""Chinki"", an ignorance she hilariously exploits, and uses old-fashioned kindness and love to 'cure' many patients at the hospital, including Karan, a suicidal youngster he met on his first day of college, and Dr. Pawri's father, who at one point fell ill and short of a desire to live. He even thanks an underappreciated janitor and arranges to bring a stripper inside the patient ward to cheer up Zaheer, a man dying from stomach cancer who he befriends in the process.

When Asthana learns about the stripper episode, he sees this as a potential reason to expel Munna on disciplinary grounds but fails to do so after Munna injures himself to stay back. However, after he recovers, the hospital staff, patients and students stand in Asthana's way and refuse to let Munna leave. Munna is then made to take a test before the entire college the next day to keep his enrolment. Later that night, Zaheer dies; still in shock, Munna gives up at a point during the test and leaves; in the process, Anand Banerjee, a paraplegic patient who has been brain-dead for the last 12 years, comes back to life. Suman realizes Munna as the miracle behind Anand's recovery and gives a heartfelt speech, defending his actions. Asthana, finally moved, is forced to change his opinion of Munna.

Munna does not become a doctor, but news of his 'miraculous' treatments reaches his parents. They return to the city and forgive him. Munna ends up marrying Suman after learning of her true identity, and together, they open a real hospital in Munna's family village. Circuit also gets married a year later and has a son nicknamed ""Short Circuit"". Asthana resigns as the dean and becomes the head doctor, employing Munna's methods. As the film concludes, Anand, restored to normal mental health, narrates the story to a few children at the hospital as he is about to leave for Kolkata.","Comedy, Drama, Musical","starring       = {{unbulleted list|[[Sunil Dutt]]|[[Sanjay Dutt]]|[[Gracy Singh]]|[[Jimmy Sheirgill]]|[[Arshad Warsi]]|[[Rohini Hattangadi]]|[[Boman Irani]]}}

241,Dil Chahta Hai,"== Plot ==
In [[Mumbai]], best friends Akash, Sameer and Siddharth (aka Sid) attend their college graduation. Akash notices a pretty girl called Shalini and approaches her. Unknown to him, Shalini is engaged to the short-tempered Rohit, who punches Akash for flirting with his fiancée. After the incident, Sameer's girlfriend, Priya, asks him to cut ties with Akash. Sameer hesitates, and is dumped by Priya. The next day, he, Akash, and Sid, go on an impromptu [[road trip]] together to [[Goa]]. Akash comes across a clingy ex-girlfriend, Deepa, whom he avoids. Sid finds Deepa alone on the beach one day, and encourages her to move on. Meanwhile, Sameer has taken a liking to Christine, whom he met at the beach and who claims to be of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] origin. He stays back with her, but is swindled of his money as Christine turns out to be a crook. 

Returning home, Sameer is set up by his parents for an [[arranged marriage]] with Pooja.

Despite Akash's insistence that he do nothing, Sameer befriends Pooja and tries to pursue her. Sid meets an older neighbour called Tara, who is an [[interior designer]]. Tara lost custody of her daughter to her ex-husband, and has a growing addiction to alcohol. Despite the associated [[taboo]], Sid finds himself attracted to her. He confesses his feelings one evening to Akash and Sameer. Akash is dismissive, comparing Sid's infatuation to his own [[virginity|""first time""]] with an older woman, leading Sid to slap him.

Sameer and Pooja find love after she breaks up with Subodh. In Sydney, Akash runs into Shalini, who is visiting her uncle, Mahesh.

After seeing the [[opera]] with Shalini, Akash realises he wants Shalini as a life-partner, but she has to return to Mumbai for her wedding to Rohit. With Mahesh and Sameer's encouragement, Akash proposes to Shalini publicly for the second time after their graduation, though she accepts this time, as she has also fallen in love with him. Sid had left town when Tara reacted negatively to his feelings for her. In the present, he returns to find her suffering from [[liver cirrhosis]] due to alcohol. Sid rushes her to the hospital, where he is visited by Sameer. Akash chooses not to come, but regrets in the morning after driving by his [[alma mater]]. Sameer informs Sid of his plans to marry Pooja, and Akash drops by the hospital to bury his grudge. Sid is summoned into Tara's ward as she is dying. She wishes Sid happiness before passing away. 

Six months later, Sid is grieving, but has accompanied Akash, Sameer, Pooja and Shalini, on a trip to Goa. He meets a woman who smiles back at him.

244,Catch Me If You Can,"==Plot==
<!--Please do not expand the plot summary any further. Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words.-->
In 1969, [[FBI]] agent Carl Hanratty arrives in [[Marseille]], [[France]], to pick up a prisoner named [[Frank Abagnale Jr.]], who has fallen ill due to the prison's poor conditions.

Six years ago, Frank lived in [[New Rochelle]], [[New York (state)|New York]], with his father, Frank Sr., and his French mother, Paula. During his youth, he witnesses his father's many techniques for conning people, but Frank Sr.'s tax problems with the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] eventually force the family to move from their house and into a small apartment.

One day, Frank discovers his mother is having an affair with Jack Barnes, his father's friend from the New Rochelle [[Rotary Club]]. When his parents divorce, Frank runs away. Needing money, he turns to [[Confidence trick|confidence scams]] to survive, his cons progressively growing bolder. He poses as a [[Pan Am]] pilot named Frank Taylor and forges the airline's payroll checks. Soon, his forgeries are worth millions of dollars.

News of the crimes reaches the FBI and Carl begins tracking Frank. He finds him at a motel, but Frank tricks Carl into believing he is a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent named [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]. He escapes before Carl realizes he was fooled.

Frank then begins to impersonate a doctor. As Dr. Frank Conners, he falls in love with Brenda, a naive young hospital nurse, and asks her attorney father for both her [[Marriage proposal|hand in marriage]] and help with arrangements to take the [[Louisiana State Bar Association|Louisiana State Bar]] exam, which Frank passes. Carl tracks Frank to his and Brenda's engagement party, but Frank escapes through a bedroom window, telling Brenda to meet him at [[Miami International Airport]] two days later.

At the airport, Frank spots Brenda, but also plainclothed agents. He realizes she has given him up, then drives away. Reassuming his pilot identity, he stages a recruiting drive for stewardesses at a local college. Surrounded by eight women as stewardesses, he conceals himself from Carl and the other agents at the airport and escapes on a flight to [[Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport|Madrid]].

In 1967, Carl tracks down Frank in his mother's hometown of [[Montrichard]], France, and convinces him to surrender to the French police. Frank is immediately arrested and taken into French custody, but Carl assures him that he will get him extradited back to the U.S.

Picking back up once more in 1969, Carl takes Frank on a flight back to the U.S. As they approach, Carl informs Frank that Frank Sr. has died. Grief-stricken, Frank escapes from the plane and reaches the house of his mother, who now has a daughter with Barnes. Frank surrenders to Carl and is sentenced to 12 years in a maximum-security prison.

Carl occasionally visits Frank. During one visit, he shows him a fraudulent check from a case he is working on. Frank immediately deduces that the bank teller was involved in the fraud. Impressed, Carl convinces the FBI to allow him to serve the remainder of his sentence working for the FBI Financial Crimes Unit. Frank agrees but soon grows restless doing the tedious office work.

One weekend, Frank prepares to impersonate a pilot again and is intercepted by Carl, who is willing to let him continue with his con, assuring him that no one is chasing him and that it's his choice.  Frank returns to work and discusses another fraud case with Carl, who asks him how he cheated on the Louisiana State Bar exam. Frank tells him he studied and passed it. Carl smiles and asks Frank if he's telling the truth, but Frank doesn't answer, instead giving Carl input on a new fraud case.

A postscript says that Frank lived for 26 years in the [[Midwestern United States]] with his wife, with whom he had three sons, remained friends with Carl, and made a living as a leading expert on bank fraud and forgery in the FBI.","Biography, Crime, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!-- Per poster billing -->

245,Amores perros,"==Plot==
The film is constructed from three distinct stories linked by a car crash that brings the characters briefly together.

===''Octavio y Susana''===
Octavio ([[Gael García Bernal]]) is in love with his brother's wife Susana ([[Vanessa Bauche]]) and dislikes the way she is abused by his brother Ramiro ([[Marco Pérez (actor)|Marco Pérez]]). Octavio tries to persuade her to run away with him. Local thug Jarocho, happy after winning in a [[Dog fighting|dog fight]], lets his dog loose on some strays and is threatened by a homeless guy wielding a [[machete]]. Eventually, Jarocho sics his dog on Octavio's [[rottweiler]], Cofi, but his own dog is killed instead. Octavio and his friend Jorge, realising Cofi's potential, become involved in the dogfighting scene. Octavio makes enough money to flee with Susana, and pays Mauricio, the owner of the dogfighting venue, to get Ramiro beaten up. Afraid, Ramiro steals the money and leaves with Susana. Struggling financially, Octavio accepts a challenge by Jarocho to participate in a private dogfight, with no outside bets. Cofi is about to win, but Jarocho shoots him. The infuriated Octavio stabs Jarocho in the stomach. Pursued by Jarocho's thugs, Octavio finds himself in a car chase with Jorge and the wounded Cofi. A collision follows; Jorge dies and Octavio is badly injured.

===''Daniel y Valeria''===
Magazine publisher Daniel ([[Álvaro Guerrero]]) leaves his family to live with his lover Valeria ([[Goya Toledo]]), a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[supermodel]]. On the day they move in together, Valeria's leg is severely broken in Octavio's car crash and she is unable to continue working as a model. As Valeria is recuperating in Daniel's apartment, her dog Richie disappears under a broken floorboard and becomes trapped. The missing dog triggers tension and arguments for the couple, leading to doubts about their relationship on both sides. Trying to rescue the dog, Valeria again injures her leg; Daniel finds her hours later. Valeria's new leg injury results in severe [[arterial thrombosis]] and eventually [[gangrene]]. Her leg is [[amputation|amputated]]. While she is in the hospital, Daniel finally rescues Richie from the floorboards. When she returns, Valeria drives her wheelchair through the torn-up [[lovenest]] and looks out of the window expecting to see a billboard bearing her likeness, only to find it has been removed.

===''El Chivo y Maru''===
The homeless guy occasionally seen in Octavio's story is revealed to be a professional [[contract killer|hitman]] called El Chivo ([[Emilio Echevarría]]). He is a former private school teacher who was imprisoned after committing terrorist acts for [[guerrilla]] [[Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre|movements]]. He is trying to make contact with his daughter, Maru, whom he abandoned when he began his guerrilla involvement and who believes that he is dead. He is about to perform a hit on a businessman when Octavio's car crash interrupts him. During the chaos at the car crash, he steals Octavio's money and takes the wounded Cofi to his warehouse hideout to nurse the dog back to health. One day, while El Chivo is out, Cofi kills the other mongrel dogs El Chivo is caring for. He is about to kill Cofi, but decides against it. Meanwhile, Octavio's brother Ramiro is shot and killed during an attempted bank robbery.

At Ramiro's funeral, Octavio meets Susana, and again attempts to convince her to run away with him, but she angrily rejects the notion. A few days later, Octavio is shown waiting at the bus station for Susana. She never shows up, and Octavio does not board the bus. El Chivo learns that his client and his intended victim are half-brothers. He leaves both men alive and chained to separate walls with a pistol within reach between them, their fate left uncertain. He then breaks into his daughter Maru's house and leaves her a large bundle of money along with a message on her [[answering machine]] explaining what happened to him. When he is about to tell Maru that he loves her, the answering machine stops recording. He then goes to an autoshop, where he sells the client's [[SUV]]. The mechanic asks him the dog's name, and El Chivo calls him ""Negro"" (""Black""). After El Chivo receives the money for the car, he and Negro walk away, disappearing into the horizon.","Drama, Thriller","starring        = [[Emilio Echevarría]]<br />[[Gael García Bernal]]<br />[[Goya Toledo]]<br />[[Álvaro Guerrero]]<br />[[Vanessa Bauche]]<br />[[Jorge Salinas]]<br />[[Adriana Barraza]]

249,The Sixth Sense,"== Plot ==
In [[Philadelphia]], child psychologist Malcolm Crowe is at home with wife Anna when Vincent Grey, a former patient Malcolm had treated, breaks into their house. Vincent accuses Malcolm of failing him before shooting Malcolm and then himself.

Months later, Malcolm has begun working with Cole Sear, a nine-year-old boy who reminds him of Vincent. He feels he must help Cole to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with Anna, who has become distant and cold and is suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. Cole's mother Lynn worries about him, especially after seeing mysterious signs of physical harm. At a birthday party, when bullies see that Cole is terribly scared of a cupboard, they lock him in there, causing him to scream in terror about someone seemingly inside with him. Following this, Cole finally confides to Malcolm that he sees dead people who walk around like the living do, unaware that they are dead.

Malcolm thinks Cole is [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] and considers dropping his case. However, after listening to an audiotape from a session with Vincent, he hears a man begging for help in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] when Vincent is supposed to be alone in the room, suggesting that Vincent had the same ability. He realizes that Cole is telling the truth and suggests that he try to communicate with the ghosts and help them finish their business.

One night, Cole discovers Kyra Collins, a female child ghost, vomiting. He finds out who she is and goes with Malcolm to the funeral reception at her home. In her room, Kyra gives Cole a videotape that he hands to her father. The tape reveals Kyra's stepmother [[Factitious disorder imposed on another|poisoning her food]], alerting her father to the reality of her death and saving her younger sister from the same fate.

Now that Cole is doing better socially and personally, he tries out for and is given a lead part in the school play. He is coached by a ghost director and gives a masterful performance with Malcolm looking on. Before leaving, Cole suggests that Malcolm try speaking to Anna while she is asleep to ensure he can understand her better. While stuck in traffic, Cole tells Lynn his secret. When she does not believe him, he tells her that his late grandmother visits him and describes details from his mother's childhood that he could not have known.

Malcolm returns home to find his wedding video playing and Anna talking in her sleep, asking Malcolm why he left her. Suddenly, she drops his wedding ring and he notices that it is not on his finger.

Malcolm quickly comes to terms with the fact that he is a ghost, and tells Anna that she was never second to anything and that he loves her. Anna's face relaxes, indicating she is now at peace and can move on.

251,The Truman Show,"== Plot ==
Selected at birth and legally adopted by a television studio following an [[unwanted pregnancy]], Truman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of ''The Truman Show'', a [[reality television]] program filmed and broadcast worldwide, 24/7, through approximately five thousand hidden cameras.

Truman's hometown, Seahaven Island, is set inside an enormous soundstage, which allows Christof, the show's creator and [[executive producer]], to control most aspects of Truman's life, including the weather. Truman's world is populated by actors and crew members who serve as his community while carefully keeping him from discovering the truth. They also earn revenue for the show through cleverly disguised [[product placement]]. To prevent Truman from escaping, Christof has orchestrated various scenarios, such as the ""death"" of Truman's father in a boating accident to instill [[thalassophobia]], and has the cast reinforce Truman's anxieties with messages about the dangers of traveling and the virtues of staying home.

Though the producers intend for Truman to fall in love with and marry a woman named Meryl, Truman develops feelings for Sylvia, an [[Extra (acting)|extra]]. Sympathetic to Truman's plight, she tries to tell him the truth, but is fired and forcibly removed from the set before she can convince him. Truman eventually marries Meryl, but their relationship is stilted and passionless, and he secretly continues to imagine a life with Sylvia and dreams of traveling to [[Fiji]], where he was told she had moved. Meanwhile, in the real world, Sylvia joins ""Free Truman,"" an activist group that calls for Truman's liberation.

As the show approaches its thirtieth anniversary, Truman begins to notice unusual occurrences, such as a stage light falling from the sky, an isolated patch of rain that falls only over him, a radio transmission describing his movements through town, and the reappearance of his father, who is rushed away by crew members before Truman can confront him. Deducing that the city somehow revolves around him, Truman begins questioning his life and asking who he sees as his closest confidants to help him solve the mystery.

Truman's suspicions culminate in an attempt to escape the island, but increasingly implausible occurrences block his path. Eventually, he is caught and returned home under a flimsy pretext. There, he confronts Meryl and challenges the sincerity of their marriage. A panicked Meryl tries to change the subject with a product placement, causing Truman to snap and hold her at knifepoint. Meryl [[breaking character|breaks character]] to call for help and is removed from the show.

Hoping to bring Truman back to a controllable state, Christof reintroduces his father to the show under the guise of him having developed amnesia after the boating accident. The show regains its ratings, and Truman seems to return to his routines. One night, however, Christof discovers that Truman has begun sleeping in his basement. Disturbed by this change in behavior, Christof sends Truman's best friend Marlon to visit and discovers that Truman has disappeared through a makeshift tunnel in the basement. Christof suspends the broadcast for the first time in its history, leading to record viewing numbers.

Christof orders a citywide search for Truman and is soon forced to break the production's day-night cycle to optimize the hunt. Truman is found sailing away from Seahaven, having conquered his fear of water. Christof resumes the transmission and creates a violent storm in an attempt to capsize Truman's boat. Truman nearly drowns, but he continues to sail until his boat strikes the wall of the dome. Horrified, Truman looks around and finds a staircase leading to an exit door. As he contemplates leaving, Christof speaks to Truman directly, revealing the truth about the show and encouraging him to stay by claiming that there is no more truth in the real world than in his artificial one. Truman utters his catchphrase: ""In case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night,"" bows to the audience, and exits. Viewers around the world celebrate Truman's escape, and Sylvia races to greet him. The executive producers end the program with a shot of the open exit door, leaving Christof devastated. After the broadcast ends, Truman’s viewers look for something else to watch.","Comedy, Drama","starring credit and text at the bottom includes the film's tagline and credits.

One enforcer urinates on the Dude's rug before the two realize they have the wrong man and leave.

Consulting his bowling partners, [[Vietnam veteran]] Walter Sobchak and Donny Kerabatsos, the Dude visits wealthy philanthropist Jeffrey Lebowski (""the big Lebowski""), requesting compensation for the rug. Lebowski refuses but the Dude tricks his assistant Brandt into letting him take a similar rug from the mansion. Outside, he meets Bunny, Lebowski's [[trophy wife]] and her German [[Nihilism|nihilist]] friend Uli. Soon afterward, Bunny is apparently kidnapped and Lebowski hires The Dude to deliver a [[ransom]]. That night, another group of thugs ambushes the Dude, taking his replacement rug on behalf of Lebowski's daughter Maude, who has a sentimental attachment to it.

Convinced the kidnap was a ruse by Bunny, Walter fakes the ransom drop. He and the Dude return to the bowling alley, leaving the briefcase of money in the car trunk. While they are bowling, their car is stolen. The Dude is confronted by Lebowski, who has an envelope from the kidnappers containing a severed toe, supposedly Bunny's. Maude asks the Dude to help recover the money her father illegally withdrew from the family's charity foundation.

The police recover the Dude's car. The briefcase is missing but the Dude finds a clue: a sheet of homework signed by a teenager named Larry Sellers. Walter learns that Larry is the good-for-nothing son of Arthur Digby Sellers, a principal writer for the television show ''[[Branded (TV series)|Branded]]'', that Walter reveres. The Dude and Walter visit Larry but get no information from him, as Larry remains mute and affectless through Walter's increasingly volatile and obscene interrogation. Walter assumes a sports car in front of Larry's house was purchased with the ransom and smashes it. The car actually belongs to a neighbor, who smashes the Dude's car in return.

Jackie Treehorn's thugs abduct the Dude and bring him to the porn kingpin, who demands to know where Bunny is and what happened to his money. The Dude says Bunny faked her kidnapping and Larry has the money then passes out from a [[Mickey Finn (drugs)|spiked drink]] Treehorn gave him. He is arrested while wandering deliriously in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] and evicted by the police chief. On his way home Bunny (whose toes are intact) drives by, unnoticed by the Dude.

Maude is waiting for the Dude at his home and has sex with him, wishing to become pregnant by a father with whom she will not have to interact. She tells the Dude that her father has no money of his own, his wealth came from her late mother.

The Dude and Walter confront Lebowski and find Bunny has returned, having gone out of town without telling anyone. Bunny's nihilist friends took the opportunity to blackmail Lebowski, who in turn, had tried to embezzle money from the family charity, blaming its disappearance on the blackmailers. The Dude believes the briefcase never contained any money. An enraged Walter suspects Lebowski is faking his paralysis and lifts him out of his wheelchair but his condition is real.

Walter and the Dude are bowling when a rival bowler, Jesus Quintana, interrupts them. Walter had previously stated that he could not bowl on Saturdays since he is [[shomer Shabbat|shomer Shabbos]]. In a tirade, Quintana implies he does not believe Walter's excuse for not bowling on Saturday, threatens Walter and the Dude and storms out. Outside the bowling alley, the nihilists set fire to the Dude's car and demand the ransom money. Walter fights them off but Donny dies from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. On a cliff overlooking the [[Pacific Ocean]], Walter eulogizes Donny’s passing, but ultimately ruins it by unrelatedly referring to his fallen comrades in Vietnam. As he scatters Donny's ashes, they are blown back onto the Dude by an ill-timed updraft. As Walter tries to brush off the ashes, the Dude finally loses his temper and yells at him for everything that has happened. After apologizing and consoling the Dude, the two go bowling.

At the bowling alley, the Dude encounters the Stranger, the movie's narrator, who sums up everything that happened in the film and states that while he ""didn't like seeing Donny go"", he remains inspired by the Dude and that Maude is pregnant with a ""little Lebowski on the way.""","Comedy, Crime, Sport","starring       = {{Plainlist|

259,Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"== Plot ==
Simran lives with her conservative family in the suburbs of [[London]]. Her father, Baldev, is a strict disciplinarian, who does not encourage spending time outside or engaged in frivolous activities. Simran has been betrothed since birth, to marry a man named Kuljeet, who is the son of Baldev's friend in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].

Following their graduation, Simran's friends wish to travel across Europe. Simran asks her father for permission to go on the trip, and he agrees. Also on the trip, in a separate party, is Raj, who is accompanying his friends despite having failed in college. Raj and Simran meet on the train, and immediately dislike each other. Raj is flirtatious with every girl he meets, but Simran prefers to keep to herself.

While stopping at [[Zurich]], Raj and Simran both try to buy souvenirs and end up missing their train. Stranded alone in a foreign country, they decide to travel together to catch up with the rest of their group. Simran opens up to Raj, who confesses having had many girlfriends. Eventually, they reunite with their friends towards the end of the trip, but both have fallen in love with each other. When Simran's father hears of this, he immediately moves the family to Punjab so Simran can marry Kuljeet.

Raj shows up at Simran's London address, but finds out that she has left. He follows her to India, where they reunite in the village outside her current residence. Raj and Simran wish to marry, but Raj does not want her to elope with him. Instead, he hopes to win over Simran's family during the months-long festivities before the wedding, so that they can agree to the match themselves. He befriends Kuljeet while out hunting, and Kuljeet unwittingly introduces Raj to his and Simran's family.

Raj stays at Kuljeet's house, and becomes the center of the wedding party. He attracts the attention of Kuljeet's sister, Preeti, during his stay, and Preeti's parents decide to ask Raj's father to arrange their marriage. Raj's father, Dharamvir, arrives in Punjab and immediately agrees to the match, not knowing that Raj is in love with Simran and not Preeti. On the eve of Simran's wedding, Raj and Simran discuss eloping again, but Raj rejects the idea. 

The next day, Baldev discovers a photograph of Raj and Simran in Europe. He realises Raj is the boy she fell in love with on her trip, and throws Raj out of the house. On the train station, Raj and Kuljeet start brawling. Raj wins the fight when Kuljeet attacks Dharamvir, but spares his life. As the train is about to depart, Simran begs Baldev to let her go with Raj. Seeing the love his daughter feels for him, Baldev agrees. Raj pulls Simran on the train, similar to the way they first met in London.","Drama, Romance",,"director       = [[Aditya Chopra]]

260,Before Sunrise,"==Plot==
On June 16, 1994, Jesse meets Céline on a train from Budapest, and they strike up a conversation. Jesse is going to Vienna to catch a flight back to the United States, whereas Céline is returning to university in Paris after visiting her grandmother. When they reach Vienna, Jesse asks Céline to disembark with him, saying that 10 or 20 years down the road, she might not be happy with her significant other and might wonder how her life would have been different if she had picked someone else. Alternatively, she may just realize Jesse himself is not that different from the rest. Lacking the money to rent a room for the night, they decide to roam around in Vienna until Jesse's flight the next morning.

After visiting a few landmarks in Vienna, they share a kiss at the top of the [[Wiener Riesenrad]] at sunset and start to feel a romantic connection. As they continue to roam around the city, they begin to talk more openly with each other, with conversations ranging from topics about love, life, religion, and their observations of Vienna.

When they are walking alongside the [[Donaukanal]], they are approached by a man who offers to write them a poem with a word of their choice inside. Jesse and Céline decide on the word ""milkshake” and are soon presented with the poem ""Delusion Angel"" (written for the film by poet [[David Jewell (poet)|David Jewell]])—a poem that Jesse cynically claims the man had already previously written and just inserts the words people choose.

Later, while playing pinball at a local club, Céline tells Jesse that her last boyfriend broke up with her six months ago, claiming that she ""loved him too much.” When questioned, Jesse reveals he had initially come to Europe to spend time with his girlfriend who was studying in Madrid, but they broke up soon after he was there. He found a cheap flight home, via Vienna, but it did not leave for two weeks so he bought a [[Eurail]] pass and traveled around Europe. In a [[Viennese café]], Jesse and Céline stage fake phone conversations with each other, playing each other's friends they pretend to call. Céline reveals that she was ready to get off the train with Jesse before he convinced her. Jesse reveals that after he broke up with his girlfriend, he bought a flight that really was not much cheaper, and all he really wanted was an escape from his life.

They admit their attraction to each other and how the night has made them feel, though they understand that they probably will not see each other again. They decide to make the best of what time they have left. They then get a bottle of wine and share it together in a park and begin discussing whether or not they should have sex. Céline says that she doesn't just want to be a one-night stand for Jesse, and then Jesse explains that, if given the choice, he would marry her instead of never seeing her again. They begin kissing passionately and embracing each other, then it is heavily implied Jesse and Céline have sex in the park. The film ends the next day at the [[Wien Westbahnhof|train station]], where, just as Céline's train is about to leave, the couple decide not to exchange any contact information but instead meet at the same place in six months.","Drama, Romance","starring       = {{Plainlist|

267,Dead Poets Society,"==Plot==
<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. -->
In 1959, Todd Anderson begins his junior year of high school at Welton Academy, an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] [[Single-sex education|all-male]] [[University-preparatory school|preparatory]] [[boarding school]] in [[Vermont]].  Todd is assigned one of Welton's top students, junior Neil Perry, as his roommate, and through Neil, he meets his friends: Knox Overstreet, Richard Cameron, Steven Meeks, Gerard Pitts, and Charlie Dalton.

On the first day of classes, the boys are taken aback by the unusual teaching methods of their new English teacher, John Keating. A Welton alumnus who studied [[English literature|English Literature]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], Keating encourages his students to ""seize the day"", referencing the Latin expression ''[[carpe diem]]''.

Keating has the students take turns standing on his desk to demonstrate ways to look at life differently, tells them to rip out the introduction of their poetry books that explains a mathematical formula for rating poetry, and invites them to make up their own style of walking in a courtyard to encourage their individualism. Keating's methods attract the attention of strict headmaster Gale Nolan.

Upon learning that Keating had been a member of the unofficial Dead Poets Society during his time as a student at Welton, Neil restarts the club, and he and his friends sneak off campus to a cave, where they read poetry. Keating's lessons and their involvement with the club encourage them to live their lives on their own terms. Knox pursues Chris Noel, a cheerleader who is dating Chet Danburry, a football player from a local public school, and whose family is friends with his.

Neil discovers his love of acting, and gets the role of [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Puck]] in a local production of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', despite the disapproval of his controlling father, who wants him to attend [[Harvard University|Harvard]] to study medicine. Keating helps Todd come out of his shell and realize his potential when he takes him through an exercise in self-expression, resulting in his spontaneously composing a poem in front of the class.

Charlie publishes an article in the school newspaper, on behalf of the club, recommending that girls be admitted to Welton. In response, Nolan [[Paddle (spanking)|paddles]] Charlie, attempting to force him to reveal who else is in the Dead Poets Society; but Charlie remains defiant. Nolan also confronts Keating, advising him that he should discourage his students from questioning authority. Keating admonishes the boys, warning them that one must assess all potential consequences of one's actions.

On the eve of the play's opening performance, Neil's father discovers his involvement in the play and demands that he quit immediately. Keating advises Neil to stand his ground to prove to his father that he takes acting seriously. After Neil performs in the play, his father retaliates by withdrawing him from Welton and enrolling him in Braden Military School. Lacking any support from his mother and unable to explain to his father how he feels, Neil commits suicide using his father's gun.

At Neil's parents' request, Nolan investigates his death. During the investigation, Cameron shifts blame onto Keating to avoid punishment for his role in the Dead Poets Society, and he names the other members of the group. When Charlie confronts him over this, Cameron urges the other students to let Keating take the fall. Charlie punches Cameron and is expelled. Each of the boys is called to Nolan's office to sign a letter confirming Cameron's false allegations. When Todd's turn comes, he reluctantly signs the letter under the pressure of his parents, and Keating is fired as a result.

Nolan, who had taught English at Welton prior to becoming headmaster, temporarily takes over Keating's English class. As Keating interrupts the class to gather his belongings, Todd confesses that the boys were pressured into signing the letter that led to his dismissal. Keating assures Todd that he believes him. Nolan threatens to expel Todd and anyone else who speaks out of line. Despite the threat, Todd stands up on his desk and says ""[[O Captain! My Captain!]]"".  The other members of the Dead Poets Society, except for Cameron, along with several other students in the class, follow suit. Touched by their support, Keating proudly thanks the boys before departing.","Comedy, Drama","starring        = [[Robin Williams]]

274,Fitzcarraldo,"==Plot==
In the early part of the 20th century, [[Iquitos]], Peru, a small city east of the [[Andes]] in the [[Amazon basin]], is experiencing rapid growth due to a [[Amazon rubber cycle|rubber boom]], and many Europeans and North African [[Sephardic Jewish]] immigrants are settling in the city, bringing their cultures with them. One immigrant, an Irishman named Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald (known by the locals as ""Fitzcarraldo""), is a lover of opera and a great fan of the internationally-renowned Italian [[tenor]] [[Enrico Caruso]]. He dreams of building an [[opera house]] in Iquitos, but, although he has an indomitable spirit, he has little capital. The Peruvian government has parceled up the areas in the Amazon basin known to contain [[rubber trees]]. However, the best parcels having already been leased to private companies for exploitation, Fitzcarraldo has been trying and failing to make the money to bring opera to Iquitos by various other means, including an ambitious attempt to construct a Trans-Andean Railway.

A rubber baron shows Fitzcarraldo a map and explains that, while the only remaining unclaimed parcel in the area is on the [[Ucayali River]], a major [[tributary]] of the Amazon, it is cut off from the Amazon (and access to Atlantic ports) by a lengthy section of [[rapids]]. Fitzcarraldo notices that the [[Pachitea River]], another Amazon tributary, comes within several hundred meters of the Ucayali upstream of the parcel.{{efn|This is [[fictional]]. The Pachitea is a tributary of the Ucayali, not a third river, and their [[confluence]] is nearly 500 kilometers south of Iquitos. The true map looks nothing like the one Fitzcarraldo draws.}} He leases the inaccessible parcel from the government, and his paramour, Molly, a successful [[brothel]] owner, funds his purchase of an old [[riverboat|steamship]], which he [[Ceremonial ship launching|christens]] the SS ''Molly [[Aida]]'', from the rubber baron. After fixing up the boat, Fitzcarraldo recruits a crew and takes off up the Pachitea, which is largely unexplored because of the hostile [[Jivaroan peoples|indigenous people]] who live on its banks.

Fitzcarraldo intends to go to the closest point between the Ucayali and the Pachitea, pull his three-deck, 320<!--ARTICLES SAY 320/340/350/360, CONSERVATIVE VALUE PICKED-->-ton steamship up the muddy 40° hillside, and [[portage]] it from one river to the next.<ref name=""Blank-1-11-25"">{{Cite web

Soon after they enter indigenous territory, the majority of Fitzcarraldo's crew, who are unaware of his full plan, abandon the expedition, leaving only the captain, engineer, and cook. The natives are impressed by the steamship and, once they make contact, agree to help Fitzcarraldo without asking many questions. After months of work and great struggles, they successfully pull the ship over the mountain using a complex system of pulleys and aided by the ship's anchor [[windlass]]. The crew falls asleep after a drunken celebration, and the chief of the natives severs the rope securing the ship to the shore. Fitzcarraldo awakens as the boat is going through the [[Pongo de Mainique|Ucayali rapids]], and is unable to stop it. The ship does not sustain any major damage, but Fitzcarraldo is forced to abandon his quest. Before returning to Iquitos, he learns that the natives helped him move the ship so they could attempt to appease the river gods by shooting the rapids in the enormous ship.

Lacking an opera house, they construct their sets on the deck of the ship, and the entire city of Iquitos comes down to the riverbank to watch as Fitzcarraldo floats it by, managing to bring opera to the city after all.","Adventure, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|

{{Hatnote|Note: Since there are several versions of ''Blade Runner'', this summary excludes version-specific events. See the [[Versions of Blade Runner|Versions of ''Blade Runner'']] article for discussion of version-specific plot elements.}}
<!-- Note: The plot summary serves as an overview of the film's events. Per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. -->

In 2019 Los Angeles, former police officer [[Rick Deckard]] is detained by Officer [[List of Blade Runner characters#Gaff|Gaff]], who likes to make [[origami]] figures, and is brought to his former supervisor, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Harry Bryant|Bryant]]. Deckard, whose job as a ""blade runner"" was to track down bioengineered humanoids known as [[replicant]]s and terminally ""retire"" them, is informed that four replicants are on Earth illegally. Deckard begins to leave, but Bryant ambiguously threatens him and Deckard stays. The two watch a video of a blade runner named [[List of Blade Runner characters#Dave Holden|Holden]] administering the Voight-Kampff test, which is designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional responses to questions. The test subject, [[Leon Kowalski|Leon]], shoots Holden on the second question. Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and three other Nexus-6 replicants: [[List of Blade Runner characters#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]], [[Characters in Blade Runner#Zhora Salome|Zhora]], and [[List of Blade Runner characters#Pris Stratton|Pris]].

Bryant has Deckard meet with the CEO of the company that creates the replicants, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Dr. Eldon Tyrell|Eldon Tyrell]], so he can administer the test on a Nexus-6 to see if it works. Tyrell expresses his interest in seeing the test fail first and asks him to administer it on his assistant [[List of Blade Runner characters#Rachael|Rachael]]. After a much longer than standard test, Deckard concludes privately to Tyrell that Rachael is a replicant who believes she is human. Tyrell explains that she is an experiment who has been given false memories to provide an ""emotional cushion"", and that she has no knowledge of her true nature.

In searching Leon's hotel room, Deckard finds photos and a scale from the skin of an animal, which is later identified as a synthetic snake scale. Deckard returns to his apartment where Rachael is waiting. She tries to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo, but Deckard reveals that her memories are implants from Tyrell's niece, and she leaves in tears.

Replicants Roy and Leon meanwhile investigate a replicant eye-manufacturing laboratory and learn of [[List of Blade Runner characters#J.F. Sebastian|J. F. Sebastian]], a gifted genetic designer who works closely with Tyrell. Pris locates Sebastian and manipulates him to gain his trust.

A photograph from Leon's apartment and the snake scale lead Deckard to a strip club, where Zhora works. After a confrontation and chase, Deckard kills Zhora. Bryant also orders him to retire Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation. Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd, but he is ambushed by Leon, who knocks the gun out of Deckard's hand and beats him. As Leon is about to kill Deckard, Rachael saves him by using Deckard's gun to kill Leon. They return to Deckard's apartment and, during a discussion, he promises not to track her down. As Rachael abruptly tries to leave, Deckard restrains her and forces her to kiss him, and she ultimately relents. Deckard leaves Rachael at his apartment and departs to search for the remaining replicants.

Roy arrives at Sebastian's apartment and tells Pris that the other replicants are dead. Sebastian reveals that because of a genetic [[premature aging]] disorder, his life will be cut short, like the replicants that were built with a four-year lifespan. Roy uses Sebastian to gain entrance to Tyrell's penthouse. He demands more life from his maker, which Tyrell says is impossible. Roy confesses that he has done ""questionable things"" but Tyrell dismisses this, praising Roy's advanced design and accomplishments in his short life. Roy kisses Tyrell and then kills him by crushing his skull. Sebastian tries to flee and is later reported dead.{{#tag:ref|Sebastian's death was never shot because of concerns over too much violence in the film.{{sfn|Sammon|p=175}}|group=nb}}

At Sebastian's apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but he kills her as Roy returns. Roy's body begins to fail as the end of his lifespan nears. He chases Deckard through the building and onto the roof. Deckard tries to jump onto another roof but is left hanging on the edge. Roy makes the jump with ease and, as Deckard's grip loosens, Roy hoists him onto the roof to save him. Before Roy dies, he laments that his memories ""[[Tears in rain monologue|will be lost in time, like tears in rain]]"". Gaff arrives to congratulate Deckard, also reminding him that Rachael will not live, but ""then again, who does?"" Deckard returns to his apartment to retrieve Rachael. While escorting her to the elevator, he notices a small origami [[unicorn]] on the floor.

Mike, Steven, and Nick are preparing to leave for military service in [[Vietnam]]. Steven is engaged to Angela Ludhjduravic, who was secretly impregnated by another man. Mike and Nick are close friends who live together and both love Linda, who will be moving into their home to escape from her alcoholic father. While dancing at Steven and Angela's wedding, Linda accepts Nick's spontaneous marriage proposal. Nick implores Mike to ensure he returns from Vietnam. Mike, Nick, and their friends go on a final hunting trip. Mike kills a deer with a single shot.

In 1969 in Vietnam, Mike, now a [[U.S. Army Special Forces|Green Beret]], happens upon Nick and Steven, who land in a village during an Air Assault mission. The three are soon imprisoned by the [[Viet Cong]] in a cage along a river and forced to participate in games of [[Russian roulette]] while the jailers bet. Steven fires his round at the ceiling and is forced into a cage with rats and previous victims of the jailers. Mike convinces his captors to put three bullets into the revolver's cylinder. Mike kills two captors as he and Nick overpower their captors, however, Nick is wounded in the leg.  They quickly escape, rescuing Steven in the process.

The trio floats down the river on a felled tree trunk, but Nick and Steven are weak from their wounds.  They are rescued by an American helicopter, but Steven falls back into the river while trying to grab onto the helicopter skids. Nick boards, however, Mike drops down to help Steven, whose legs are broken in the fall. Mike carries him until they meet refugees and a South Vietnamese Army convoy fleeing to [[Saigon]].

Nick is treated at a U.S. [[military hospital]]. Once released, Nick, now suffering from [[PTSD]], wanders into a gambling den. French businessman Julien Grinda persuades him to come inside. Upset, Nick interrupts a game of Russian roulette, pulling the trigger on himself. Mike happens to be present as a spectator, but Nick and Julien hurriedly leave.

Sometime later, Mike returns home, but cannot integrate into civilian life. He avoids a welcome-home party, opting to stay alone in a hotel. He visits Linda and learns that Nick has deserted. Mike then visits Angela, who is now a mother, but has slipped into catatonia following the return of Steven, who has lost both of his legs in the war. Stan, Axel, and John understand nothing of war or what Mike has experienced. Linda and Mike find comfort in each other's company. During a hunting trip, Mike stops himself from shooting a deer and returns to the cabin where he finds Stan cavalierly threatening Axel with his pistol. Mike takes it, chambering a single round, and triggers an empty chamber at Stan's head.

Mike visits Steven at a veterans' hospital; both of Steven's legs have been amputated, and he has lost the use of an arm. Steven refuses to come home, saying he no longer fits in. He tells Mike that he has been regularly receiving large sums of money from Vietnam. Mike intuits that Nick is the source of these payments, and forces Steven to return home to Angela. Mike returns to Vietnam in search of Nick. Wandering around Saigon, which is now in a state of chaos shortly before [[Fall of Saigon|its fall]], Mike finds Julien and persuades him to take him to the gambling den. Mike finds himself facing Nick, who has become a professional in the macabre game and fails to recognize Mike. Mike attempts to bring Nick back to reason by invoking memories of their hunting trips back home, but Nick maintains his indifference. However, during a game of Russian roulette between Mike and Nick, Nick recalls Mike's ""one shot"" method and smiles before pulling the trigger and killing himself.

Mike and his friends attend Nick's funeral, and the atmosphere at their local bar is dim and silent. Moved by emotion, John begins to sing ""[[God Bless America]]"" in honor of Nick, as everyone joins in.","Drama, War",,"director       = [[Michael Cimino]]

In 1975, [[heavyweight]] [[boxing]] world champion [[Apollo Creed]] plans to hold a [[title bout]] in [[Philadelphia]] during the upcoming [[United States Bicentennial]]. However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injured hand, and that all other potential replacements are either booked up or unable to get into shape in time. Having already invested heavily into the fight, Creed decides to give a local contender a chance to challenge him.

Creed selects [[Rocky Balboa]], an [[Italian Americans|Italian-American]] [[Journeyman (sports)#Boxing, kickboxing and mixed martial arts|journeyman]] [[Southpaw stance|southpaw]] boxer who [[clubfighter|fights primarily in small gyms]] and works as a collector for a [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] [[loan shark]], on the basis of his nickname, ""The Italian Stallion"". Rocky fights in a local Philadelphia fight club, and he won his last fight with Spider Rico. He meets with [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] George Jergens, who tells him Creed has selected Rocky to fight him for the World Heavyweight Championship. Reluctant at first, Rocky eventually agrees to the fight, which will pay him $150,000. Rocky undergoes several weeks of unorthodox training, such as using sides of [[beef]] as [[punching bag]]s.

Rocky is later approached by Mickey Goldmill, a former [[bantamweight]] fighter-turned-trainer whose gym Rocky frequents, about further training. Rocky is not willing initially, as Mickey has not shown much interest in helping him before and saw him as a wasted talent, but eventually Rocky accepts the offer.

Rocky begins to build a romantic relationship with Adrian Pennino, a shy woman who is working part-time at the J&M Tropical Fish [[pet store]]. Adrian's brother and Rocky's best friend, Paulie, helps Rocky get a date with his sister and offers to work as a [[cornerman]] with him for the fight, an offer Rocky turns down. Paulie becomes jealous of Rocky's success, but Rocky placates him by agreeing to advertise the [[Meat packing industry|meat packing business]] where Paulie works for sponsorship as part of the upcoming fight, and both of them reconcile. Rocky trains extensively for the championship fight, while Apollo is unconcerned about the match and puts more effort into promotion than training. The night before the match, Rocky visits the [[Spectrum (arena)|Spectrum]] and begins to lose confidence. He confesses to Adrian that he does not believe he can win, but strives to [[The distance (boxing)|go the distance]] against Creed, which no other fighter has done, to prove himself to everyone.

On [[New Year's Day]], the fight is held with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as [[George Washington]] and then [[Uncle Sam]]. Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first round—the first time that Creed has ever been knocked down. Humbled and worried, Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight, though his ego never fully fades. The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds, with both combatants sustaining various injuries: Rocky, with hits to the head and swollen eyes, requires his right eyelid to be cut to restore his vision, while Apollo, with internal bleeding and a broken rib, struggles to breathe. As the fight concludes, Creed's superior skill is countered by Rocky's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches and his dogged refusal to go down. As the final bell sounds, with both fighters embracing each other, they promise each other there will be no rematch.

The fight is extremely well received by the sportscasters and the audience. Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down as Paulie distracts security to help her get into the ring. As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a [[split decision]], Rocky and Adrian embrace and profess their love for each other, not caring about the outcome of the fight.","Drama, Sport","starring       = {{Plainlist|

282,Barry Lyndon,"==Plot==
===Part I: ''""By What Means Redmond Barry Acquired the Style and Title of Barry Lyndon""''===
In the 1750s [[Kingdom of Ireland]],<!--- there is literally no reason to shorten/remove this, remember how common geo-historical illiteracy is --> Redmond Barry's father is killed in a [[duel]]. Barry becomes infatuated with his cousin Nora Brady, and shoots her suitor, [[British Army]] captain John Quin, in a duel. He flees but is robbed by [[highwaymen]] on his way to [[Dublin]]. Penniless, Barry enlists in the British Army. Family friend Captain Grogan informs him that Quin is not dead: the duel was staged so that Nora's family could get rid of Barry and improve their finances through her marriage to Quin.

Barry serves with his regiment in Germany during the [[Seven Years' War]], but [[desertion|deserts]] after Grogan dies in combat against the [[French Royal Army]]. Absconding with a lieutenant's horse and uniform, Barry has a brief affair with Frau Lieschen, a married German peasant woman. On his way to [[Bremen]], he encounters Captain Potzdorf, who sees through the ruse and [[Impressment|impresses]] him into the [[Prussian Army]]. Barry later saves Potzdorf's life and receives a commendation from [[Frederick the Great]].

At the end of the war, Barry is recruited by Captain Potzdorf's uncle into the Prussian Ministry of Police. The Prussians suspect that the Chevalier de Balibari, an Austrian [[diplomat]] and professional gambler, is in fact an Irishman and a spy for Empress [[Maria Theresa]], and assign Barry to become his manservant. An emotional Barry confides everything to the Chevalier and they become confederates. After they win an enormous sum from the Prince of Tübingen at cards, the Prince deduces that he has been cheated and refuses to pay his debt; the Chevalier in turn threatens to demand [[Duel#Offence and satisfaction|satisfaction]]. To avoid a scandal, the Ministry of Police pays off the debt and quietly escorts the Chevalier outside  Prussian borders, which allows Barry, disguised as the Chevalier, to leave the country as well.

Barry and the Chevalier travel across Europe, perpetrating similar gambling scams, with Barry forcing payment from debtors with sword duels. In [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], he encounters the beautiful, wealthy, and visibly depressed Lady Lyndon. He seduces her, and goads her elderly husband Sir Charles Lyndon to death with verbal repartee.

===Part II: ''""Containing an Account of the Misfortunes and Disasters Which Befell Barry Lyndon""''===
In 1773, Barry marries Lady Lyndon, takes her last name and settles in England. The Countess bears Barry a son, Bryan Patrick, whom Barry spoils. The marriage is unhappy: Barry is openly unfaithful and squanders his wife's wealth while keeping her in seclusion. Lord Bullingdon, Lady Lyndon's son by Sir Charles, still grieves for his father and sees Barry as a gold digger who does not love his mother. Barry responds with years of escalating [[emotional abuse|emotional]] and [[physical abuse]]. 

Barry's mother comes to live with him and warns him that if Lady Lyndon dies, Bullingdon will inherit everything. She advises her son to obtain a title. To this end, Barry cultivates the influential Lord Wendover and spends even larger sums of Lady Lyndon's money to ingratiate himself with [[high society]]. Bullingdon, now a young adult, interrupts a society party Barry throws. He publicly accuses his stepfather of infidelity, abuse and financial mismanagement, and announces that he will leave the Lyndon estate for as long as Barry remains there. Barry responds by brutally assaulting Bullingdon until they are physically separated by the party attendees. In the aftermath, Barry is ostracised by high society and plunges further into financial ruin.

Barry arranges to gift Bryan a full-grown horse for his ninth birthday. An impatient Bryan rides the horse unaccompanied and dies in a riding accident. Barry sinks into [[alcoholism]], while Lady Lyndon seeks religious counseling from clergyman Samuel Runt, who had been tutor to Bullingdon and Bryan and a longtime companion of Lady Lyndon. When Barry's mother dismisses Runt to keep her son from losing control, Lady Lyndon attempts suicide. Runt and Graham, the family's steward, write to Bullingdon, who returns to the estate and challenges his stepfather to a duel.

After Bullingdon misfires the first shot, Barry [[Delope|fires into the ground]] in an effort to abort the duel. Bullingdon refuses to accept this as satisfaction and shoots Barry in the leg, forcing an amputation below the knee. While Barry is recovering, Bullingdon takes control of the Lyndon estate. Through Graham, he reminds Barry that his credit is exhausted and offers him 500 [[Guinea (coin)|guineas]] a year to leave Lady Lyndon, her estates, and England forever. Barry grudgingly accepts and resumes his former gambling profession, but without any real success. In December 1789, a melancholic Lady Lyndon signs Barry's annuity cheque as her son looks on.","Adventure, Drama, History","starring       = {{Plainlist|

'''''Barry Lyndon''''' is a 1975 [[Epic film|epic]] [[historical drama]] film written, directed, and produced by [[Stanley Kubrick]], based on the 1844 novel ''[[The Luck of Barry Lyndon]]'' by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]].<ref name=""BFIsearch"">{{Cite web |title=Barry Lyndon |url=https://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceFilmWorks/150046269 |access-date=21 August 2024 |website=British Film Institute Collections Search}}</ref> Narrated by [[Michael Hordern]], and starring [[Ryan O'Neal]], [[Marisa Berenson]], [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]], [[Leonard Rossiter]] and [[Hardy Krüger]], the film recounts the early exploits and later unravelling of an 18th-century [[Anglo-Irish]] rogue and [[golddigger]] who marries a rich widow to climb the social ladder and assume her late husband's aristocratic position.

Kubrick began production on ''Barry Lyndon'' after his 1971 film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. He had originally intended to direct a [[Stanley Kubrick's unrealized projects#Napoleon|biopic on Napoleon]], but lost his financing because of the commercial failure of the similar 1970 [[Dino De Laurentiis]]-produced ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]''. Kubrick eventually directed ''Barry Lyndon'', set partially during the [[Seven Years' War]], utilising his research from the Napoleon project. Filming began in December 1973 and lasted roughly eight months, taking place in [[England]], [[Ireland]], and [[Germany]].

The film's cinematography has been described as ground-breaking. Especially notable are the long [[Two shot|double shots]], usually ended with a slow backwards zoom, the scenes shot entirely in candlelight, and the settings based on [[William Hogarth]] paintings. The exteriors were filmed on location in England, Ireland, and Germany, with the interiors shot mainly in London.<ref name=""production""/> The production had problems related to logistics, weather,<ref name=""production"">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/marisa-berenson-on-the-making-of-barry-lyndon-kubrick-wasnt-a-difficult-ogre-he-was-a-perfectionist-a7134716.html|website=[[The Independent]]|title=Marisa Berenson on the making of Barry Lyndon: Kubrick wasn't a 'difficult ogre – he was a perfectionist'|date=13 July 2016|access-date=20 June 2020|archive-date=20 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820023434/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/marisa-berenson-on-the-making-of-barry-lyndon-kubrick-wasnt-a-difficult-ogre-he-was-a-perfectionist-a7134716.html|url-status=live}}</ref> and politics (Kubrick feared that he might be an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] hostage target).<ref name=""Whitington""/><ref name=""rte""/>

''Barry Lyndon'' received seven nominations at the [[48th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], winning four for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Scoring: Original Song Score and Adaptation or Scoring: Adaptation]], 
[[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. Although some critics took issue with the film's slow pace and restrained emotion, its reputation, like that of many of Kubrick's works, has grown over time.  In the [[The Sight and Sound Greatest Films of All Time 2022|2022 ''Sight & Sound'' Greatest Films of All Time]] poll, ''Barry Lyndon'' placed 12th in the directors' poll and 45th in the critics' poll.

289,Cool Hand Luke,"==Plot==
In early 1950s Florida, decorated World War II veteran Lucas ""Luke"" Jackson drunkenly beheads several [[parking meter]]s. He is sentenced to two years on a [[chain gang]] in a prison camp run by the Captain, a stern warden, and Walking Boss Godfrey, a quiet rifleman nicknamed ""the man with no eyes"" because he always wears mirrored sunglasses. There, even minor violations are punished by ""a night in the box"", a small wooden booth in the prison yard with limited air and space.

Luke refuses to observe the established order among the prisoners and quickly runs afoul of their leader, Dragline. When the two have a boxing match, Luke is severely outmatched but refuses to acquiesce. Eventually, Dragline stops the fight, but Luke's tenacity earns the prisoners' respect and draws the guards' attention. He later wins a poker game by [[bluff (poker)|bluffing]] with a hand worth nothing, and Dragline christens him ""Cool Hand Luke"".
[[File:Cool Hand Luke 2.jpg|thumb|left|Luke and the chain gang finish paving the road|270px]]
After a visit from his sick mother, Arletta, Luke becomes more optimistic about his situation. He repeatedly shows defiance to the Captain and the guards, and his sense of humor and independence prove inspiring to the other prisoners. Luke's struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than a day. The prisoners start to idolize him after he wins a bet that he can eat 50 [[hard-boiled eggs]] in an hour.

One evening, Luke receives notice that his mother has died. Anticipating that Luke might attempt to escape to attend the funeral, the Captain has him locked in the box. After being released, Luke becomes determined to escape. Under cover of a Fourth of July celebration, he makes his initial escape attempt. He is recaptured by local police and returned to the chain gang. The Captain has Luke fitted with [[leg iron]]s and delivers a warning speech to the inmates.

Shortly afterward, Luke escapes a second time. While free, Luke mails the prison a magazine that includes a photograph of himself with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. The Captain warns Luke that he will be killed if he ever attempts to escape again. Luke becomes annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and says he faked it. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but when Luke returns after a long stay in the box and is punished by being forced to eat a massive serving of rice, the others help him finish it.
[[File:Cool Hand Luke 3.jpg|thumb|250px|Luke defies the authorities for the last time]]
For his escape, the guards brutalize Luke to the point of exhaustion, particularly when he is forced to repeatedly dig and refill a grave-sized hole in the prison yard. He eventually breaks down and begs for mercy, losing the respect of his fellow inmates. Luke seems to succumb to cowardice and become an errand boy for the guards, but when an opportunity presents itself, he flees again by stealing a truck, with Dragline joining him. After abandoning the truck, the pair agree to separate. Luke enters a church and talks to God, whom he blames for sabotaging him so he cannot win in life. Police cars appear moments later, and Dragline arrives to tell him that he will not be hurt if he surrenders peacefully. Instead, Luke mockingly repeats the Captain's warning speech at the police. Godfrey shoots him in the neck. Dragline carries Luke outside and surrenders, but charges at Godfrey and strangles him until he is subdued by the guards.

While Luke is loaded into the Captain's car, Dragline tearfully implores him to live. Despite protests from local police, the Captain decides to take Luke to the distant prison infirmary instead of the local hospital to ensure Luke will not survive the trip. As the car drives away, a semi-conscious Luke weakly smiles while the tires crush Godfrey's sunglasses. (It is implied that Luke soon dies of his injuries.)

Some time later, the prison crew works near a rural intersection close to where Luke was shot, with Dragline now wearing leg irons and a new Walking Boss supervising.  Dragline and the other prisoners fondly reminisce about Luke.","Crime, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|

295,Sanjuro,"==Plot==
Nine young [[samurai]] believe that the lord chamberlain, Mutsuta, is corrupt after he tore up their petition against fraud at court. One of them tells the superintendent Kikui of this and he agrees to intervene. As the nine meet secretly to discuss this at a shrine, a [[rōnin]] overhears and cautions them against trusting the superintendent. While at first they do not believe him, he saves them from an ambush. But as their rescuer is about to leave, he realises that Mutsuta and his family must now be in danger and decides to stay and help.

By the time the samurai get to Mutsuta's house, the chamberlain has been abducted and his wife and daughter are held prisoner there. Following the rōnin's suggestion, a servant from the house gets the guards drunk, allowing the samurai to free the women. Then the group hide in a house next door to the superintendent's compound. When Mutsuta's wife asks the rōnin his name, he looks out of the window at the surrounding [[camellia]] trees and says it is {{nihongo|Tsubaki Sanjūrō|椿三十郎}}, literally ""thirty-year-old camellia"". The lady then criticises ""Sanjuro"" for killing too frequently and insists that ""the best sword is kept in its sheath.""

Sanjuro decides to get closer to the corrupt officials and joins their henchman Hanbei, who had previously offered him a job after the ambush at the shrine. Although the samurai distrustfully decide to keep watch on him, Sanjuro realises he is being followed as he walks along with Hanbei, and their shadows are easily captured and bound. Made to believe that a much larger group may be involved, Hanbei leaves to request reinforcements. Sanjuro then frees the four captured samurai, although having to kill all their guards. He tells the four to leave him tied up, then explains to Hanbei on his return that he did not wish to die in a cause in which he had no stake.

The chamberlain's whereabouts are not discovered until the next day, when Mutsuta's wife and daughter find a piece of the torn petition in the small stream that flows from the superintendent's compound past their hideout. Since an attack on the officials is impossible with the compound full of armed men, Sanjuro hatches a plan to get the army away by reporting to Hanbei that he saw the rebels at a temple where he was sleeping. Meanwhile he has told his group of samurai that he will send the signal to attack by floating large numbers of camellias down the stream.

The first part of the plan works, with the superintendent's forces rushing off to the temple; however, Hanbei becomes suspicious after catching Sanjuro trying to drop the camellias into the stream and ties him up. Just as Hanbei is preparing to kill him, the remaining corrupt officials realise that Sanjuro has tricked them—his description of the temple was incorrect. They convince Hanbei not to waste any further time and instead catch up with the superintendent's forces and have them return as soon as possible. However, Sanjuro tricks the officials into giving the signal for the samurai to come to the rescue. Hanbei returns to find he has been made a fool of once again.

Mutsuta is restored to his position and the superintendent commits [[hara-kiri]], much to the chamberlain's regret, as he wished to avoid a public scandal. As his family and the loyal samurai are celebrating, they discover that Sanjuro has slipped away. The samurai race off to find Sanjuro and Hanbei about to duel.

Sanjuro is reluctant to fight and tries to dissuade Hanbei, but Hanbei is furious at his loss of dignity and declares he can only find peace by killing Sanjuro. Hanbei draws his sword, but the faster Sanjuro kills him. When the young samurai cheer his victory, Sanjuro becomes angry, stating that Hanbei was just like him: ""a sword unsheathed"". Also warning that he will kill them if they follow him. His admirers can only kneel and bow as he walks away.","Action, Comedy, Crime","starring       = {{plainlist|*[[Toshiro Mifune]]

296,The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,"==Plot==
Near the turn of the 20th century, U.S. Senator Ransom ""Ranse"" Stoddard and his wife Hallie arrive in Shinbone, a [[Border town|frontier town]] in an unnamed [[Western United States|Western]] state, to attend the funeral of Tom Doniphon. When asked by the local newspaper reporter why a senator would attend the funeral of a poor rancher, Stoddard answers with a story that flashes back 25 years.

Entering the then-unincorporated territory as a young lawyer, Ranse is beaten and robbed by infamous outlaw Liberty Valance and his gang. Tom Doniphon and his handyman, Pompey, find Ranse and take him to Shinbone, where Tom's girlfriend, Hallie, treats his wounds. Ranse learns Valance frequently terrorizes Shinbone and the surrounding country since the local [[town marshal|marshal]], Link Appleyard, is too cowardly to stop him. Tom says Valance only understands force, but Ranse is determined to bring Valance to justice through the law.

While establishing his practice, Ranse [[Busser|buses tables]] at Peter Ericson's [[steakhouse]], where Hallie works, and befriends Dutton Peabody, the editor of the  ''Shinbone Star'' newspaper. After learning Hallie is illiterate, Ranse opens a school for children and adults in the back of the newspaper's office. He also begins practicing with Peabody's old gun after Valance bullies him in the restaurant. Hallie tells Tom of Ranse's gun practice. Tom takes Ranse to his ranch for a shooting lesson, shows off renovations that are intended for his planned marriage to Hallie and makes those intentions clear to Ranse. During the lesson, he tricks Ranse by shooting a paint can above his head and staining his clothes, telling Ranse he can expect the same kind of trickery from Valance. Ranse angrily punches Tom and leaves.

Shinbone's men meet to elect two delegates to the upcoming statehood convention at the territorial capital. Tom refuses Ranse's nomination; ultimately, Ranse and Peabody are elected. Valance, hired by the [[cattle baron]]s who oppose statehood, fails to intimidate the voters into selecting him. Valance challenges Ranse to a gunfight. Tom offers to assist Ranse in leaving town, but Ranse stubbornly declines.

That evening, Valance and his gang vandalize the newspaper office and severely injure Peabody for reporting Valance's murder of a local farmer. Ranse arms himself and goes after Valance; even drunk, Valance easily wounds and disarms Ranse, then prepares to kill him. Ranse retrieves his gun and shoots, and Valance falls dead. Ranse returns to Ericson's, where Hallie treats his wounded arm; Tom enters and sees Hallie's affection for Ranse as she attends his wounds. He gets drunk and forces Appleyard to run Valance's men out of town. Tom then attempts suicide by setting fire to his house, but Pompey rescues him.

At the territorial convention, Ranse is nominated for delegate to Congress, but withdraws after a representative of the cattle barons accuses him of building a career from murdering a man. Tom arrives and explains to Ranse that it was he who killed Valance; knowing that Ranse could not beat Valance, Tom shot him with Pompey's rifle at the same time Ranse fired. Tom encourages Ranse to accept the nomination for Hallie's sake before quietly walking out of the convention.

In the present, Ranse's rising political achievements – state governor, senator, ambassador to the United Kingdom, and likely vice-presidential nominee in the upcoming election – fill the intervening years. The newspaper editor decides publishing the story would ruin Ranse's legacy, burns the reporter's notes, and leaves Ranse to conduct Tom's funeral. When Ranse asks why, the editor says ""when the legend becomes fact, print the legend.""

On the return trip to Washington, D.C., Ranse contemplates retiring to Shinbone, which pleases Hallie. Hallie admits placing a cactus rose on Tom's coffin, a plant Tom knew Hallie liked. As Ranse thanks the train conductor for the railroad's courtesies, the conductor answers, ""Nothing's too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance!""","Drama, Western","starring       ={{ubl| [[John Wayne]] | [[James Stewart]] | [[Vera Miles]] | [[Lee Marvin]] | [[Edmond O'Brien]] | [[Andy Devine]]<!--- per poster billing block - in which Wayne and Stewart are transposed versus opening credits --->}}

305,The Bridge on the River Kwai,"==Plot==
In 1943, a contingent of British [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], led by [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]] Nicholson, arrive at a [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] prison camp in [[Thailand]]. [[United States Navy]] [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Shears tells Nicholson that the camp conditions are horrific. Nicholson forbids any escape attempts because headquarters ordered them to surrender. Also, the dense surrounding jungle renders escape virtually impossible.

Colonel Saito, the camp commandant, informs the prisoners they will construct a railway bridge over the [[Khwae Yai River|River Kwai]] connecting [[Bangkok]] and [[Rangoon]]. Nicholson objects, citing the [[Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War (1929)|Geneva Convention]] exempting officers from manual labour. Saito threatens to have the officers shot, but [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] Clipton, the British medical officer, warns him there are too many witnesses. The officers are left standing in the intense heat until evening when Saito then confines them to a punishment hut. Nicholson is beaten and locked in an iron box.

Shears and two other prisoners try to escape, though only Shears survives. Wounded, he wanders into a Thai village, where he is nursed back to health. He eventually recuperates in the British colony of [[Ceylon]].

The bridge construction proceeds badly due to incompetent Japanese engineering and the prisoners' slow pace and sabotage. Saito informs Nicholson he is expected to commit [[seppuku|ritual suicide]] if the construction is not completed by the deadline. Desperate, he releases Nicholson and his officers, exempting them from manual labour. Nicholson, shocked by the poor job his men have done, orders the design and building of a proper bridge. He considers it a lasting tribute to the [[British Army]]'s ingenuity but Clipton argues it is collaboration with the enemy. Nicholson's obsession drives him to volunteer his officers to work on the project.

Major Warden tries to recruit Shears for a commando mission to destroy the bridge. Shears refuses, revealing he impersonated an officer in hopes of better treatment as a prisoner. He is informed that they already knew of his deception, and that he has been temporarily transferred to the British military and therefore has no choice. Warden, Shears, and two others—Chapman and Joyce—parachute into Thailand. Chapman dies on landing, and Warden is wounded in an encounter with a Japanese patrol. Khun Yai, a village chief, and a group of Thai women guide Warden, Shears, and Joyce to the river. Under cover of darkness, Shears and Joyce plant explosives at the base of the bridge towers. The first train to cross the bridge is scheduled for the following day, and Warden wants to destroy both the train and the bridge. By daybreak, however, the river level has dropped, exposing the wire leading to the detonator.

Nicholson spots the wire, and he and Saito investigate as the train approaches. Nicholson pulls up the wire on the riverbank, leading them toward Joyce, who is manning the detonator. Joyce breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson inexplicably calls to Japanese soldiers for help and attempts to stop Joyce from reaching the detonator. After Joyce is shot, Shears swims across the river to detonate the explosives, but is wounded. Recognizing Shears, Nicholson exclaims, ""What have I done?"" Warden fires a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], fatally wounding Nicholson. Dazed, Nicholson stumbles towards the detonator and falls on the plunger, blowing up the bridge; the train tumbles into the river. Witnessing the carnage, Clipton exclaims, ""Madness!&nbsp;... Madness!""","Adventure, Drama, War","starring       = {{Plainlist|

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->New York [[Professional boxing|prize fighter]] Terry Malloy's career was cut short when he [[Match fixing|purposely lost a fight]] at the request of mob boss Johnny Friendly. Terry now works for Friendly's [[labor union]] as a [[Dockworker|longshoreman]] while his older, more educated brother Charley is Friendly's right-hand man. Terry is coerced into luring fellow worker Joey Doyle onto a rooftop, where he believes Friendly's henchmen want to talk Joey out of testifying to the [[Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor|Waterfront Crime Commission]]. When they instead murder Joey by throwing him off the roof, Terry confronts Friendly, but is threatened and bribed into acquiescence.

Joey's sister Edie and priest Father Barry try to inspire the dockworkers to stand up to Friendly. Terry attends the meeting as a snitch, but when it is violently broken up by Friendly's men, he helps Edie escape and misses Father Barry convincing one worker to testify. After the testimony, the worker is killed in a staged workplace accident.

Terry's own unwillingness to testify is softened by his growing feelings for Edie and her and Father Barry’s pursuit of justice. He confesses his role in Joey's death to both. Shocked by this, Edie distances herself from him.

Friendly sends Charley with a job offer to keep Terry quiet. Knowing refusal will get Terry killed, Charley urges him to comply. When Terry expresses regret about throwing his best fight and blames Charley for setting up the fix, Charley hands him a gun and tells him to run. Terry finds Edie and they kiss. After hearing someone in the street, they find Charley murdered.

Determined to kill Friendly, Terry is convinced by Father Barry to instead testify in court. Following the hearing, Friendly loses his powerful connections and faces [[indictment]].

When he is excluded from the next hiring call at the harbor, Terry confronts Friendly together with the other workers, saying that he is proud of testifying and no longer betraying himself. After seeing Terry get beaten severely by Friendly’s thugs, the longshoremen refuse to work without him and renounce Friendly, wishing to run the union ""on the up-and-up"". Encouraged by Edie and Father Barry, Terry stumbles to the warehouse. The men follow him inside and the door closes, leaving Friendly outside, ignored by the workers and shippers.","Crime, Drama, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist|

Arthur ""Cody"" Jarrett is a ruthless, psychotic criminal and leader of the Jarrett gang. Although married to Verna, he is overly attached to his equally crooked and determined mother, ""Ma"" Jarrett.

Cody and his gang rob a [[Railway Mail Service|mail train]] in the [[Sierra Nevada]] mountains, killing four members of the train's crew. While on the lam, Cody has a severe migraine, which Ma nurses him through. Afterward, Ma and Cody have a quick drink and toast, ""Top of the world!"" before rejoining the others. The gang splits up.

However, one gang member was severely scalded during the attack by escaping steam from the locomotive. The gang had left the helpless man in their hiding place. His body puts the police on Cody's trail.

Informants enable the authorities to close in on a motor court in Los Angeles where Cody, Verna, and Ma are holed up. Cody shoots and wounds [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury]] investigator Philip Evans and makes his escape. He then puts his emergency scheme in motion: confess to a lesser crime committed by an associate in [[Springfield, Illinois]], at the same time as the train job—a federal crime—thus providing him with a false [[alibi]] and assuring him a lesser sentence. He turns himself in and is sentenced to one to three years in state prison. Evans, however, plants undercover agent Hank Fallon (as ""Vic Pardo"") in Cody's cell. His task is to find the ""Trader,"" a fence who launders stolen money for Cody.

On the outside, ""Big Ed"" Somers, Cody's ambitious right-hand man, takes charge. Verna betrays Cody and joins Ed. Ed pays inmate Roy Parker to kill Cody. In the prison workshop, Parker attempts to drop a heavy piece of machinery on Cody, but Hank pushes Cody out of the way, saving his life and gaining Cody's trust. Ma visits and vows to ""take care of"" Big Ed, despite Cody's frantic attempts to dissuade her. He starts worrying and decides to break out with Hank. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Verna has murdered Ma, whom she despised (as well as vice versa), by shooting her in the back. Big Ed knows this and holds this information over Verna to keep her with him. When Cody learns of Ma's death from a new inmate, he goes berserk in the mess hall. He concocts an escape plan.

In the infirmary, he is diagnosed as having a ""homicidal psychosis"" and is recommended for transfer to an asylum. Another inmate sneaks him a gun, which Cody uses to take hostages, and along with Hank and their cellmates, Cody escapes. They also take along Parker. Cody later kills him in cold blood.

When they learn of Cody's escape, Big Ed and Verna anxiously await his return. Verna tries slipping away, but Cody catches her. Although Verna murdered Ma, she convinces Cody that Big Ed did it, so Cody guns him down. The gang welcome the escapees, including Hank, whom Cody likes and trusts. They start planning their next job.

A stranger shows up at the gang's isolated hideout, asking to use the phone. Hank is concerned. Cody introduces the stranger as ""The Trader,"" Daniel Winston. Cody plans to steal a chemical plant's payroll by using an empty tanker truck as a [[Trojan horse]]. Hank says he will repair Verna's radio, then rigs a signal transmitter and attaches it to the tanker; on the way to the plant, he manages to get a message to Evans. The police track the tanker and prepare an ambush.

The gang gets into the payroll office, but the tanker driver, ex-con ""Bo"" Creel, recognizes Hank and informs Cody. Having tracked the truck to [[Long Beach, California]], using [[direction finder]]s, the police surround the building and call on Cody to surrender; he decides to fight it out. When the police fire [[tear gas]] into the office, Hank manages to escape. In the ensuing gun battle, the police kill most of Cody's gang and Verna is arrested. Cody shoots one of his own men for trying to surrender. Finally, only Cody is still loose. He flees to the top of a gigantic, [[Horton sphere|globe-shaped gas storage tank]]. After Hank shoots Cody several times with a rifle, Cody fires at the tank, which bursts into flames. He shouts ""Made it, Ma! Top of the world!"" before the tank explodes.","Action, Crime, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist |

Holly Martins, an American author of [[western fiction|Western]] [[Pulp magazine|pulp novels]], arrives in the British sector of [[Allied-occupied Austria|Allied-occupied]] Vienna seeking Harry Lime, a childhood friend who has offered him a job. However, Martins is told that Lime was killed by a car while crossing the street. At Lime's funeral, Martins meets two [[Royal Military Police]] officers: Sergeant Paine, a fan of Martins' novels, and Major Calloway. Afterward, Martins is asked to lecture at a book club a few days later. He then meets a friend of Lime's, ""Baron"" Kurtz, who tells Martins that he and another friend, Popescu, carried Lime to the side of the street after the accident, and that, before he died, Lime asked them to take care of Martins and Lime's girlfriend, actress Anna Schmidt.

As Martins and Anna query Lime's death, they realise that accounts differ as to whether Lime was able to speak before his death, and how many men carried away the body. The porter at Lime's apartment tells them that he saw a third man helping. He offers to give Martins more information but is murdered before they can speak again; Martins and Anna flee the scene after a mob begins to suspect him of the murder. When Martins confronts Major Calloway and demands that Lime's death be investigated, Calloway reveals that Lime was stealing [[penicillin]] from military hospitals, diluting it, and then selling it on the [[black market]], injuring or killing countless people. Martins agrees to drop his investigation and leave.

An inebriated Martins visits Anna and confesses his feelings for her. A man crosses the street towards her front door, but moves away after seeing Martins at the window. After leaving, Martins walks the streets until he notices Anna's cat and realises someone is watching from a darkened doorway. In a momentary flash of light, Martins sees that the man is Lime. Martins calls out, but Lime flees and vanishes. Martins summons Calloway, who realises that Lime has escaped through the city's sewers to the Soviet sector. The British police exhume Lime's coffin and discover that the body is that of a hospital orderly who had been assisting him. Anna, who is Czech, is to be sent to the Soviet sector after the British police discover that she has a forged Austrian passport, and is questioned again by Calloway.

Martins goes to Kurtz and asks to see Lime. They meet and talk as they ride the [[Wiener Riesenrad]]. Lime speaks cynically of the insignificance of his victims' lives and the personal gains to be earned from the city's chaos and deprivation, further suggesting that he sold Anna out to the Soviet authorities in order to discourage them from pursuing him. He obliquely threatens Martins and taunts him for his infatuation with Anna before leaving quickly. Calloway asks Martins to help arrest Lime; he agrees provided that Calloway will arrange for Anna to leave Vienna rather than be handed over to the Soviets. The British authorities arrange for Anna to take a train to Paris, but she spots Martins, who has come to observe her departure, at the station. After persuading Martins to reveal the plan to capture Lime, she leaves in order to warn him. Exasperated, Martins decides to leave Vienna; on the way to the airport, Calloway stops at a hospital to show Martins children dying of [[meningitis]] who were treated with Lime's diluted penicillin, which convinces him to stay and assist in capturing Lime.

Lime arrives at a café in the international zone to meet Martins, but Anna is able to warn him that the police are closing in. He flees into the sewer, with the police following him underground. Lime shoots and kills Sgt. Paine, but Calloway shoots and badly wounds Lime. Lime drags himself up a cast-iron stairway to a street grating but cannot lift it. Martins, armed with Paine's gun, finds Lime beneath the grating and they exchange a look. Calloway shouts that Martins must take no chances and shoot on sight. Lime nods his head slightly at Martins, who then shoots and kills him.

Martins attends Lime's second funeral at the risk of missing his flight out of Vienna. He waits on the road to the cemetery to speak with Anna, but she walks past without glancing in his direction.","Film-Noir, Mystery, Thriller","starring       = {{Plain list|

314,Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"==Plot==
In the late 1930s, the governor of an unnamed western state, Hubert ""Happy"" Hopper, appoints Jefferson Smith to replace deceased [[U.S. Senator]] Sam Foley. Smith is head of the Boy Rangers, and his appointment is supported by the governor's children. Corrupt [[political boss]] Jim Taylor sought the appointment of his handpicked stooge, while popular committees wanted another candidate. Smith, however, was chosen because his naivety about politics was expected to make him easy to manipulate.

Smith is taken under the wing of the publicly esteemed, but secretly crooked, Senator Joseph Paine, who was Smith's late father's friend. Smith develops an immediate attraction to the senator's daughter, Susan. At Senator Paine's home, Smith has a conversation with Susan, fidgeting and bumbling, entranced by the young socialite. Smith's naïve and honest nature allows the unforgiving Washington press to take advantage of him, quickly tarnishing Smith's reputation with ridiculous front-page pictures and headlines branding him a [[yokel|bumpkin]].

To keep Smith busy, Paine suggests he propose a bill. With the help of his secretary, Clarissa Saunders, who was the aide to Smith's predecessor and had been around Washington and politics for years, Smith comes up with a bill to authorize a federal government loan to buy some land in his home state for a national boys' camp, to be paid back by youngsters across America. Donations pour in immediately. However, the proposed campsite is already part of a dam-building [[graft (politics)|graft]] scheme included in an appropriations bill framed by the Taylor [[political machine]] and supported by Senator Paine.

Unwilling to crucify the worshipful Smith so that their graft plan will go through, Paine tells Taylor he wants out, but Taylor reminds him that Paine is in power primarily through Taylor's influence. Paine then advises Smith to keep silent about the matter. The following day, when Smith speaks out about the bill at Senate, the machine in his state — through Paine — accuses Smith of trying to profit from his bill by producing fraudulent evidence that Smith already owns the land in question. Smith is too shocked and angry by Paine's betrayal to defend himself and runs away.

Saunders, who looked down on Smith at first, but has come to believe in him, talks him into launching a [[filibuster]] to postpone the appropriations bill and prove his innocence on the Senate floor just before the vote to expel him. In his last chance to prove his innocence, he talks non-stop for about 25 hours, reaffirming the American ideals of freedom and disclosing the dam scheme's true motives. Yet none of the senators are convinced.

The constituents try to rally around him, but the entrenched opposition is too powerful, and all attempts are crushed. Owing to the influence of Taylor's machine, newspapers and radio stations in Smith's home state, on Taylor's orders, refuse to report what Smith has to say and even distort the facts against the senator. The Boy Rangers' effort to spread the news in support of Smith results in vicious attacks on the children by Taylor's gangsters.

Although all hope seems lost, the senators begin to pay attention as Smith approaches utter exhaustion. Paine has one last card up his sleeve: he brings in bins of letters and telegrams from Smith's home state, purportedly from average people demanding his expulsion. Nearly broken by the news, Smith finds a small ray of hope in a friendly smile from the [[Vice President of the United States|President of the Senate]]. Smith vows to press on until people believe him but immediately collapses in a faint. Overcome with the pangs of remorse, Paine leaves the Senate chamber and attempts to commit suicide by gunshot but is stopped by onlooking senators. He then bursts back into the Senate chamber, shouting a confession to the whole scheme; the reformed Paine further insists that he must be expelled from the Senate and affirms Smith's innocence to Clarissa's delight. The President of the Senate observes the ensuing chaos with amusement.

316,La Grande Illusion,"==Plot==
[[File:Grand-Illusion-1937.jpg|thumb|Pierre Fresnay and Erich von Stroheim in Rauffenstein's Wintersborn office]]
During the [[World War I|First World War]], two French [[aviator]]s of the ''[[French Air and Space Force|Service Aéronautique]]'', the aristocratic Captain de Boëldieu and the working-class Lieutenant Maréchal, set out to investigate a blurred spot found on reconnaissance photographs. They are shot down by German [[flying ace]] and aristocrat, ''[[Rittmeister]]'' von Rauffenstein, and both are taken prisoner by the [[Imperial German Army]]. Upon returning to the [[aerodrome]], Rauffenstein sends a subordinate to find out if the aviators are officers and, if so, to invite them to lunch. During the meal, Rauffenstein and Boëldieu discover they have mutual acquaintances—a depiction of the familiarity, if not solidarity, within the upper classes that crosses national boundaries.

Boëldieu and Maréchal are then taken to a [[prisoner-of-war camp]], where they meet a colorful group of French prisoners and stage a [[vaudeville]]-type performance just after the Germans have taken [[Fort Douaumont]] in the epic [[Battle of Verdun]]. During the performance, word arrives that the French have recaptured the fort. Maréchal interrupts the show, and the French prisoners spontaneously burst into ""[[La Marseillaise]]"". As a result of the disruption, Maréchal is placed in solitary confinement, where he suffers badly from lack of human contact and hunger; the fort changes hands once more while he is imprisoned. Boëldieu and Maréchal also help their fellow prisoners to finish digging an escape tunnel. However, just before it is completed, everyone is transferred to other camps. Because of the language barrier, Maréchal is unable to pass word of the tunnel to an incoming British prisoner.

Boëldieu and Maréchal are moved from camp to camp, finally arriving in Wintersborn, a mountain fortress prison commanded by Rauffenstein, who has been so badly injured in battle that he has been given a posting away from the front, much to his regret. Rauffenstein tells them that Wintersborn is escape-proof.

At Wintersborn, the pair are reunited with a fellow prisoner, Rosenthal, from the original camp. Rosenthal is a wealthy [[History of the Jews in France|French Jew]] who generously shares the food parcels he receives.  Boëldieu comes up with an idea, after carefully observing how the German guards respond to an emergency. He volunteers to distract the guards for the few minutes needed for Maréchal and Rosenthal to escape. After a commotion staged by the prisoners, the guards are ordered to assemble them in the fortress courtyard. During the roll call, it is discovered that Boëldieu is missing. He makes his presence known high up in the fortress, drawing the German guards away in pursuit. Maréchal and Rosenthal take the opportunity to lower themselves from a window by a homemade rope and flee.

Rauffenstein stops the guards from firing at Boëldieu and pleads with his friend to give himself up.  Boëldieu refuses, and Rauffenstein reluctantly shoots him with his pistol, aiming for his legs but misses and accidentally (and fatally) hits him in the stomach. Nursed in his final moments by a grieving Rauffenstein, Boëldieu laments that the whole purpose of the nobility and their usefulness to both French and German culture is being destroyed by the war. He expresses pity for von Rauffenstein, who will have to find a new purpose in the postwar world.

Maréchal and Rosenthal journey across the German countryside, trying to reach neutral Switzerland. Rosenthal injures his foot, slowing Maréchal down. They quarrel and part, but then Maréchal returns to help his comrade. They take refuge in the modest farmhouse of a German woman, Elsa, who lost her husband at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], along with three brothers, at battles which, with quiet irony, she describes as ""our greatest victories"". She takes them in and does not betray them to a passing army patrol. She and Maréchal fall in love, despite not speaking each other's language, but he and Rosenthal eventually leave from a sense of duty after Rosenthal recovers from his injury. Maréchal declares he will come back to Elsa and her young daughter, Lotte, if he survives the war.

A German patrol sights the two fugitives crossing a snow-covered valley. They fire a few rounds, but their commanding officer, hurrying to the scene, orders them to stop, saying the pair have crossed into Switzerland.

317,It Happened One Night,"==Plot==
Spoiled heiress Ellen ""Ellie"" Andrews has eloped with pilot and fortune-hunter King Westley against the wishes of her extremely wealthy father, Alexander Andrews, who has sequestered his daughter and wants to have the marriage annulled because he knows that Westley is interested only in Ellie's money. Jumping ship in Florida, Ellie runs away and boards a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] to New York City to reunite with her husband. She meets fellow passenger Peter Warne, a newspaper reporter who recently lost his job. Soon, Peter recognizes her and gives her a choice. If she gives him an exclusive on her story, he will help her reach Westley. If not, he will tell her father where she is. Ellie agrees.

Ellie loses her initial disdain for Peter and they begin to fall in love. When the bus breaks down, they try [[hitchhiking]]. They fail to secure a ride until Ellie displays a shapely leg to Danker, the next driver. When they stop en route, Danker tries to drive away with their luggage, but Peter chases him down and takes his [[Model T]]. Near the end of their journey, Ellie confesses her love to Peter. The owners of the motel in which they are staying notice that Peter's car is gone and expel Ellie. Believing Peter has deserted her, Ellie telephones her father, who agrees to let her marry Westley. Meanwhile, Peter has obtained money from his editor to marry Ellie but he misses her on the road. Although Ellie has no desire to be with Westley, she believes that Peter has betrayed her for the reward money and so agrees to have a second, formal wedding with Westley.

On the wedding day, she finally reveals the whole story to her father. When Peter comes to Ellie's home, Andrews offers him the reward money, but Peter insists on being paid only his expenses, a mere $39.60 for items that he had been forced to sell to buy gasoline. When Andrews presses Peter for an explanation of his odd behavior and demands to know if he loves her, Peter first tries to dodge the questions but then admits that he does and storms out. Westley arrives via an [[autogyro]], but at the ceremony, Andrews reveals to his daughter Peter's refusal of the reward money and tells her that her car is waiting by the back gate in case she changes her mind. At the last minute, Ellie dumps Westley at the altar, bolts for her car, and drives away as the newsreel cameras crank.

A few days later, Andrews is working at his desk when Westley calls to tell him that he will take the financial settlement and not contest the annulment. His executive assistant brings him a telegram from Peter: ""What's holding up the annulment, you slowpoke? The [[Battle of Jericho|walls of Jericho]] are toppling!"" That is a reference to a makeshift wall made of a blanket hung over a rope that was tied across the rooms separating the beds they had slept in, in order to give them each privacy while traveling together. With the annulment in hand, Andrews sends the reply, ""Let 'em topple.""

Peter's battered Model T is parked in a motor court in Glen Falls, Michigan. The mom-and-pop owners talk and wonder why, on such a warm night, the newlyweds (he had seen the marriage license) wanted a clothesline, an extra blanket, and a little tin trumpet. As they look at the cabin, the toy trumpet sounds a fanfare, the blanket falls to the floor, and the lights in the cabin go out.","Comedy, Romance","starring       = {{ubl|[[Clark Gable]]|[[Claudette Colbert]]}}

320,Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans,"==Plot==
A vacationing woman from the city lingers in a lakeside town for weeks. After dark, she goes to a farmhouse where the Man and the Wife live with their child. She whistles from the fence outside. The Man is torn, but finally departs, leaving his wife with the memories of better times when they were deeply in love.

The man and woman meet in the moonlight and kiss passionately. She wants him to sell his farm—which has not done well recently—to join her in the city. When she suggests that he solve the problem of his wife by drowning her, he throttles her violently, but even that dissolves in a passionate embrace. The Woman gathers bundles of reeds so that when the boat is overturned, the Man can stay afloat.

The Wife suspects nothing when her husband suggests going on an outing, but when they set off across the lake, she soon grows suspicious. He prepares to throw her overboard, but when she pleads for his mercy, he realizes he cannot do it. He rows frantically for shore, and when the boat reaches land, the Wife flees.

She boards a trolley, and he follows, begging her not to be afraid of him. The trolley brings them to the city. Her fear and disappointment are overwhelming. He plies her with flowers and bread and finally she stops crying and accepts his gifts. Emerging back on the street, they are touched to see a bride enter a church for her processional, and follow her inside to watch the wedding. The Man breaks down and asks her to forgive him. After a tearful reconciliation, they continue their adventure in the city, having their photograph taken together and visiting a funfair. As darkness falls, they board the trolley for home.

Soon they are drifting back across the lake under the moonlight. A sudden storm causes their boat to begin sinking. The Man remembers the two bundles of reeds he placed in the boat earlier and ties the bundles around the Wife. The boat capsizes, and the Man awakes on a rocky shore. He gathers the townspeople to search the lake, but all they find is a broken bundle of reeds floating in the water.

Convinced the Wife has drowned, the grief-stricken Man stumbles home. The Woman from the City goes to his house, assuming their plan has succeeded. The Man begins to choke her. Then the Maid calls to him that his wife is alive, so he releases the Woman and runs to the Wife, who survived by clinging to one last bundle of reeds.

The Man kneels by the Wife's bed as she slowly opens her eyes. The Man and the Wife kiss, while the Woman from the city's carriage rolls down the hill toward the lake, and the film dissolves to the sunrise.","Drama, Romance","starring       = {{Plainlist|

<!--The guideline for this section is WP:FILMPLOT. Summaries should be 400-700 words.-->

Amidst the picturesque hills of [[Sultanpur, Jhelum|Sultanpur, Azad Kashmir]], [[Pakistan]] lives a six-year-old [[Muteness|mute]] girl named Shahida. One afternoon, she is playing on a hill when she accidentally falls off it. When she doesn't return home by the end of the day, the villagers organise a search party. After hours of searching, they find the little girl on a branch protruding from the hill. She had been stuck on it for the entire day but couldn't call for help because of her disability. The following morning, her parents and neighbours discuss what must be done to help her. An older man suggests they take her to the shrine of Sufi saint [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] in [[Delhi]], [[India]]. The religious family believes that visiting the holy shrine will bring peace and happiness and most importantly, restore Shahida's speech. Shahida's father, being an ex-armyman, is sure that he won't be provided with a visa to India. Hence, her mother Razia takes it upon herself to travel far from the village for the first time. The trip goes as planned for the most part. The two reach the shrine, pay for offerings and get on a train back to their home country.

On the return journey, the train stops for repairs at night. When everyone is asleep, Shahida notices a sheep stuck in a pit right outside the train. She doesn't think much before going outside to help the animal. However, the train restarts before she can return to her mother. The little girl runs towards it but is eventually left behind, and in a desperate attempt to go the same way that her mother did, she boards a freight train. But to her dismay, it goes reverse-path and stops in Kurukshetra, India. Razia notices her daughter is missing and stops the train. Policemen are appointed to look for the girl around the track where she was lost. However, they cannot find her since Shahida has already reached a different place. Razia meets her husband who is worried to death about his daughter. They cannot get an immediate visa back to India, much to their dismay. The parents have no other way but to pray that their daughter is safe.
 
Meanwhile, Shahida is now lost in a different country with no way to communicate. At a religious celebration, she sees a stranger eating at a street-side restaurant. The stranger is the kind Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi who invites her to have a meal with him. After a few minutes of trying to get her to talk, he realises she is mute and starts calling her Munni. A starving Munni finishes the food and follows Pawan around. Assuming that she was separated from her parents during the festival, he asks her to stay in front of a temple. Pawan is a devout [[Hindu]] [[Brahmin]] and an ardent devotee of [[Lord Hanuman]]. He believes that Lord Hanuman will take Munni home if she stays in front of his temple. When Munni still doesn't stop following him, he brings her to the police station. But since she cannot tell them any details about her parents, the police can only wait for someone to file a missing complaint. Until her parents are found, Munni needs a place to stay, hence, Pawan takes her in. On his way to his home in Delhi, he tells Munni to call him Mama if she ever talks in the future. He also starts naming different Indian cities, asking her to nod if she knows what city her parents are in. All the passengers on the bus help him but none of them name cities outside of India. As they talk, Pawan tells everyone how he came to Delhi for work.

A flashback shows the time he was in high school. He was an average student who could never pass the final examination. All his friends cheated and went on with their lives, but Pawan refused to cheat or lie, being a true devotee of Lord Hanuman. Eventually, he passed on his eleventh try and came to Delhi to look for work. He stayed with his father's friend, Pandey, a strict Hindu who refused to let the followers of any other religion enter his house. Pandey's daughter Rasika offered Pawan a job at the school she taught and fell in love with his innocent persona. But being the strict father he is, Pandey asked Pawan to build his own house before marrying his daughter. Even since then, Pawan and Rasika have been working hard to collect money. The two are bound to get married sometime next year. Everyone on the bus is impressed by his story. He and Munni reach his home where Rasika receives them in the doorway. She is glad that Pawan is helping a little girl in need but Pandey doesn't feel the same way. He is worried about the possibility that Munni belongs to a different religion. Pawan rationalises that she is Hindu because of her fair skin color and persuades Pandey to let her stay for a month. Munni cries every day in memory of her parents even though Pawan and Rasika treat her like their own daughter. Since the entire family is [[vegetarian]], and Munni is accustomed to eating meat with every meal, she hardly ever finishes her food.

One day, Pawan and Rasika find her in a [[Muslim]] neighbour's home devouring home-cooked chicken. Pawan brings her to a restaurant that evening and lets her eat whatever she likes, even though eating meat is against his religion. Munni is very fond of the glittery bangles they sell on the street side. One day while walking down a market, she innocently picks up a pack of bangles before being stopped by the vendor. Pawan makes her return it and takes her to the temple to apologise to God for stealing. As he teaches her to join her hands, Munni sneaks into a [[Mosque]] nearby. Pawan is hesitant to follow her inside but he does it anyway. To his utter surprise, he sees her reading the [[Quran]] in front of a shrine. For a few minutes, he feels like she betrayed him because he would have never befriended a Muslim. But Rasika makes him realise that she is a human before being Muslim. She hates that her father discriminates against people because of their religion and wants Pawan to be different. Pawan understands and runs into the Mosque to get Munni but by now, she has already left. As he nervously looks for her, she runs to him and hugs him tightly. At that moment, he accepts her entirely, overcoming his irrational fear of going against his religion.

That night is a cricket match against Pakistan and India. The entire family watches it on TV, cheering for India, except Munni who cheers when Pakistan scores. When the Pakistani team wins the game, she dances and kisses their flag on TV. Pawan approaches her and asks her if she is from Pakistan. After weeks of shaking her head to every Indian city, Munni finally nods yes. Pandey is furious. Being a Muslim was bad enough but since the girl is from Pakistan, he can no longer allow her to stay at their home. Pawan promises to hand her to the Pakistani embassy the next day. However, the embassy worker cannot allow her a [[Travel visa|visa]] without a [[passport]]. In Munni's case, they don't even know her real name so a visa allotment is impossible. Moreover, a riot takes place in front of the embassy that closes all visa processing for a month. As the last resort, Pawan takes her to a [[travel agent]] at Pandey's suggestion. The agent promises to take the little girl to the other side of the border and asks for one lakh rupees. Pawan and Rasika give up the funds they had collected for their house to help Munni. The next day, Pawan reluctantly brings Munni to the travel agent's office and leaves after a tearful farewell. On his way home, he notices a street vendor selling glittery bangles. He remembers that Munni liked them and buys one for her. However, on returning to the travel agent's office, he finds out that he has been cheated. The agent has taken the little girl to a [[brothel]] and is about to sell her into prostitution. The otherwise composed Pawan loses his temper at the sight of the agent counting bills that he made from Munni. He throws the man out of the window and brings Munni home again.

Pawan has made the decision to bring Munni home himself. Although he has no connections or ideas about Pakistani villages, he packs his bags and makes his way to the border.  A few miles away from it, they meet a secret agent named Ali who illegally transports people to the other side through a tunnel. After listening to Munni's story, he agrees to take them for free.  When they reach Pakistan's side of the border, Ali runs away but being a lord Hanuman's devotee, Pawan refuses to go without asking the guards for permission. When the officers find him, they beat him up as Munni watches and cries. Pawan pretends to laugh even while being beaten so the little girl wouldn't be afraid. After finding out the reason for his travel the head [[soldier]] asks him to do whatever he wants in the following ten minutes before they return for the next round. Pawan decides to wait for them because they have still not permitted him.  Although the idea is idiotic, and he gets beaten up again, he is eventually allowed to go, with permission from the soldiers.
 
In the following scene, he and Munni are in a restaurant. Munni sees a cop's handcuffs and steals it, assuming that it is a bracelet.  The cop finds out and throws Pawan in jail, labelling him as an Indian spy because of the lack of a passport. Then, we are introduced to a struggling journalist Chand Nawab. He finds out about the alleged spy and runs to the police station to interview him. He gets a few vague answers from Pawan and informs the media company that doesn't take him seriously. Inside the police station, a cop interrogates Pawan but refuses to believe anything he has to say. Suddenly, Munni sees a picture on a table calendar and recognises it as her village. Pawan is overjoyed until the policeman forcefully makes Munni open her mouth. Pawan loses his temper and attacks the man, inviting more trouble for himself. He manages to defeat the officers and run away from the police. Nawab sees him escaping and follows him behind.

They board the bus where Pawan shows the conductor their destination and also tells him Munni's story.  After finding out he is actually a good person, Nawab and the rest of the travellers decide to help him. They hide him and Munni on the top of the bus when the police come looking for them. At night, Nawab, Pawan, and Munni stay at a Mosque. A religious scholar named Azad also helps them and hides them from the policemen searching the entire city for the alleged spy. One of Azad's students sees ""Switzerland"" written on the picture that Munni thought was her village. The group is back to square one. After that, Azad dresses up Pawan and Nawab in a [[burqa]] and manages to send them outside the city without the police noticing. Pawan, who was oblivious to [[Islam]] a few weeks ago, feels strange in their traditional clothing. He apologises to his god but is ready to do anything for Munni. For the next few days, Pawan and Nawab take Munni to several different places, asking people if they know her. Nawab documents their journey and everything about Munni and Pawan's relationship. He tries selling the documentary to news channels, but they refuse to air it, claiming it is boring. They have to find another way to spread the news so, the people on the internet can help. One day, they go to a famous mosque where they find policemen looking for them. Nawab realises that his cameraman friend is being used by the police to gather information about their whereabouts. The trio immediately runs away from the holy place and gives the cameraman false information to distract the police.

Following that, the group is reviewing the footage from their time at the mosque when Munni recognises her mother in one of the clips. They see her getting into a specific bus and go to the bus driver the very next day. On inquiring, he names all the villages that come to his daily route. One of them is Sultanpur which Munni confirms is her home. Nawab and Pawan hug, having finally found their destination. Nawab also uploads the video documentary on YouTube and the police get a hint of their location through it. On their way to Sultanpur, the bus is stopped to be checked. With no way out, Pawan comes to the police's view and pretends to run away. While the men are trying to catch him, Nawab takes Munni and brings her back to her village. In the following scene, we see Munni run to her mother, who couldn't be happier to see her. As she reunites with her family, Pawan gets beaten up by the police.

The documentary on YouTube goes viral and bigger news channels start covering the story. Eventually, people find out that Pawan is not a spy and is being held in prison for helping a little girl. Both Indian and Pakistani people give him all their support. But the Pakistani officials refuse to let him go. They torture him in prison, beating him up for hours, drowning him until his last breath, and starving him. Nawab then claps back with another video, this time on a bigger platform, asking people to gather at the border and ensure that Pawan reaches home safely. The plan works, and several people from both sides come to the border in crowds. Rasika and her family are also among the crowd, waiting for him to come home. Eventually, the officials have to back down. The crowd erupts chanting Pawan's name as he crosses the border. Then, we see Munni among the crowd, waving her hands but unable to call him. All of a sudden, she shouts ""Mama"", the name Pawan wanted her to call him when they first met. The crowd goes silent as she yells goodbye. Pawan turns around in shock. The story ends as they run to each other and hug.","Action, Adventure, Comedy","starring       = {{unbulleted list|[[Salman Khan]]|[[Harshaali Malhotra]]|[[Kareena Kapoor Khan]] [[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]|}}

While stuck in Los Angeles traffic, Sebastian ""Seb"" Wilder has a moment of [[road rage]] directed at aspiring actress Mia Dolan. After a hard day at work, Mia's next audition goes awry because the casting director takes a phone call during an emotional scene. That night, her roommates take her to a lavish party in the [[Hollywood Hills]], promising her that someone in the crowd could jump-start her career. After her car is towed, she walks home in disappointment.

During a gig at a restaurant, Seb slips into jazz improvisation despite the owner's warning to only play traditional Christmas pieces. Mia hears him playing as she passes by. Moved, she enters the restaurant and observes Seb being fired for disobedience. Mia attempts to compliment him as he storms out, but he brushes by her. Months later, she runs into Seb at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band. Mia makes Seb play ""I Ran"" for her. After the gig, they walk to their cars and lament wasting a lovely night together despite their clear chemistry.

Seb arrives at Mia's workplace, and she shows him around the [[Warner Bros. Studios Burbank|Warner Bros. backlot]], where she works as a [[barista]], while expressing her passion for acting. He takes her to a jazz club, describing his passion for jazz and his desire to open his own club. Seb invites Mia to a screening of ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' and she accepts, forgetting a date with her boyfriend. Bored with the latter date, she rushes to the theater and finds Seb as the film begins. When the screening is interrupted by a projector malfunction, Seb and Mia spend the rest of the evening together with a romantic visit to the [[Griffith Observatory]].

After more failed auditions, Mia decides, with Seb's encouragement, to write a one-woman play. Seb begins to perform regularly at a jazz club, and the two of them eventually move in together. A former bandmate of Seb invites him to be the keyboardist in a new jazz fusion band, which will give him a steady income. Although dismayed by the band's pop style, Seb signs on after hearing Mia trying to convince her mother that he is working on his career. The band finds success, but Mia knows their music is not the type of music Seb wants to perform.

During the band's first tour, Seb and Mia argue: she accuses him of abandoning his dreams, while he claims that she liked him more when he was unsuccessful because it made her feel better about herself. Two weeks later, Seb misses Mia's play because of a photoshoot he had forgotten about. The play fails, very few people attend, and Mia overhears dismissive comments about her performance. Unable to forgive him for missing her play and their previous argument, Mia returns to her hometown of [[Boulder City, Nevada]].

Seb receives a phone call from a prominent casting director who attended Mia's play, inviting her to audition for an upcoming film. Knowing that this could be her big break, he drives in a hurry to Boulder City. He finds her house since he remembered that she lived across the street from the library, the library where she fell in love with acting. Seb persuades her to attend, and she reluctantly agrees to go. 

The next morning, Seb picks her up, and Mia greets him with a coffee. During the audition, Mia is asked to tell a story. In response, she talks about how her aunt, a one-time stage actress who eventually died from alcoholism, inspired her to chase her dreams. Confident the audition was a success, Seb encourages Mia to devote herself to acting. The two then recognize that they will always love each other despite what may come for their relationship.

Five years later, Mia is a famous actress and married to a different man, with whom she has a daughter. She is living a happy life. That night, the couple stumble upon a jazz bar. Recognizing the logo she had once designed, Mia realizes that Seb has opened his own jazz club. Seb notices Mia in the crowd and begins to play their love theme on the piano. The two imagine what might have been had their relationship thrived along with their careers before acknowledging each other with a silent exchange of smiles and going their separate ways.","Comedy, Drama, Music","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--PER POSTER BILLING-->

In 1951, police investigate the mathematician [[Alan Turing]] after an apparent home break-in. During his interrogation, Turing talks of his work at [[Bletchley Park]] during [[World War II|WWII]].

In 1928, the young Turing is constantly bullied at boarding school. Developing a friendship with [[Christopher Morcom]], who sparks his interest in [[cryptography]], he soon develops romantic feelings. However, Christopher shortly dies from tuberculosis.

When Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing joins the cryptography team of [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]], [[John Cairncross]], [[Peter Hilton]], Keith Furman, and Charles Richards in [[Bletchley Park]], directed by Commander [[Alastair Denniston]]. They are [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|to analyze]] the [[Enigma machine]], which the Nazis use to send coded messages.

Difficult to work with, and believing his colleagues inferior, Turing works alone to design a [[Bombe|machine]] to decipher Enigma messages. When Denniston refuses to fund the machine's £100,000 construction cost, Turing contacts Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who makes him team leader and funds them. Turing fires Furman and Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers to find replacements.

Cambridge graduate [[Joan Clarke]] passes Turing's test but her family will  not allow her to work with the male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her to live and work with the women who intercept the messages, and shares his plans with her. Clarke helps Turing warm to the others, who begin to respect him.

Turing's machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed but cannot determine the Enigma encryption settings quickly enough; as the Germans reset them each day. Denniston orders it to be destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes.

When Clarke plans to leave because of her parents, Turing proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their engagement party, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who advises he keep secret.

Overhearing a clerk talking about messages she receives from the same German coder and always contain the same combination of letters at the beginning, Turing has an epiphany: he can program the machine to [[known plaintext attack|decode words he already knows exist in certain messages]]. They realize that the answer to the daily code combination is in the 6:00{{nbsp}}am weather forecast, and that all telegrams contain the same phrase 'Heil Hitler', which reveals enough of the day's Enigma code for Christopher to quickly decode all the messages that same day. Recalibrating the machine, it quickly decodes a message, and the cryptographers celebrate.

Discovering a British convoy is about to be attacked, Turing realizes that if they suddenly react to prevent it, the Germans will know Enigma is compromised and change it. Therefore, the team cannot act on every decoded message, so they do not act to save the convoy although Peter begs them, as his brother serves on one of the ships. Turing asks Chief of [[MI6]] [[Stewart Menzies]] to keep this discovery a secret, and in return promises to create a statistical model to choose the warnings to send to maximize destruction and minimize detection.

Discovering Cairncross is a Soviet spy, Turing confronts him. Cairncross argues that the Soviets are allies, working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by disclosing Turing's sexuality if he divulges his identity. When Menzies threatens to have Clarke arrested as a suspected spy, Turing reveals that the spy is actually Cairncross. Menzies reveals that he already knew, and he had put Cairncross in the team so he could choose exactly what information to leak to the Soviets for British benefit.

Turing urges Clarke to leave Bletchley Park and terminate their engagement, telling her he is a homosexual. She reacts calmly, saying she always suspected but insists they would have been happy together anyway, as she never expected them to have a 'normal marriage' like most couples. Fearing for her safety, Turing says he never cared for her, and only used her for her cryptography skills. Although heartbroken, Clarke stays on, knowing how important their task is. She refuses to bow down to what Turing or her parents want her to do, or what they think of her decisions.

After the war, Menzies has the cryptographers destroy the evidence, as MI6 wants governments to believe they have unbreakable code machines. The team should never meet again or share what they have done.

In 1952, Turing is convicted of [[gross indecency]] and chooses to undergo [[chemical castration]] instead of going to prison, so he can continue his work. Clarke visits him, witnesses his physical and mental deterioration, and tries to comfort him that he has saved countless lives and made the world an infinitely better place.

The epilogue shows Turing [[Alan Turing#Death|committed suicide]] on June 7, 1954, after a year of government-mandated hormonal therapy. In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted him a [[Alan Turing#Government apology and pardon|posthumous Royal Pardon]]. Historians estimate that breaking Enigma shortened the war by over two years, saving over 14 million lives; and Turing's work was an important step towards today's computers.","Biography, Drama, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist|

341,Blade Runner 2049,"== Plot ==
<!-- Per [[WP: FILMPLOT]] plot summaries should be between 400-700 words -->
In 2049, 30 years after the events of ''[[Blade Runner]]'', [[Bioengineering|bioengineered humans]] known as [[replicant]]s are still used for slave labor. [[List of Blade Runner characters#K|K]] (short for serial number, KD6-3.7), a Nexus-9 replicant, works for the Los Angeles Police Department as a ""blade runner"", an officer who hunts and ""retires"" (kills) rogue replicant models.

After retiring replicant [[List of Blade Runner characters#Sapper Morton|Sapper Morton]], K finds a box buried under a tree at Morton's farm. It contained the remains of a female replicant who died during a [[caesarean section]]. This demonstrates that replicants could reproduce biologically, previously thought impossible. K's superior, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Lt. Joshi|Lt. Joshi]], fears this knowledge could lead to war between humans and replicants, so she orders K to retire the replicant child.

K visits the Wallace Corporation, successor to the defunct Tyrell Corporation in the manufacture of replicants. DNA archives identify the deceased female as [[List of Blade Runner characters#Rachael|Rachael]], an experimental Nexus 7 replicant. K learns of Rachael's romantic ties with former blade runner [[Rick Deckard]]. CEO [[List of Blade Runner characters#Niander Wallace|Niander Wallace]] wants the secret to replicant reproduction to expand interstellar colonization. He sends his replicant enforcer, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Luv|Luv]], to monitor K.

At Morton's farm, K finds the date 6.10.21 carved into the tree trunk and recognizes it from a childhood memory of a wooden toy horse. Because replicant memories are artificial, K's holographic A.I. girlfriend [[List of Blade Runner characters#Joi|Joi]] believes this is evidence that K was born, not created. K discovers in LAPD records two children born on that date with identical DNA aside from the [[Allosome|sex chromosome]], but only the boy is listed as alive. K tracks the child to an orphanage but the records from that year are missing. K recognizes the orphanage from his memories and finds the toy horse in the furnace where he remembers hiding it. Replicant memory designer [[List of Blade Runner characters#Ana Stelline|Dr. Ana Stelline]] confirms that his memory of the orphanage is authentic, leading K to conclude he is Rachael's son. K then fails a baseline test, marking him as rogue. When he implies to Joshi that he killed the replicant child, she gives him 48 hours to pass the test, or he will be 'retired'.

Joi hires replicant prostitute Mariette as a surrogate for her to have sex with K. The following morning, Mariette places a tracker on K's jacket prior to being sent away by a jealous Joi. Analysis of the toy horse leads K to the ruins of a radioactive Las Vegas. There he finds Deckard, who informs him he is the father of Rachael's child and scrambled the birth records to protect their offspring's identity. Deckard left the child in the custody of the replicant freedom movement. Luv kills Joshi and tracks K to Las Vegas. She kidnaps Deckard, destroys Joi, and leaves a weakened K behind. Using Mariette's tracker, the replicant freedom movement rescues K. When their leader, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Freysa Sadeghpour|Freysa]], discloses to him that Rachael's child was a girl, K deduces that Stelline is her daughter and that the toy horse memory is hers. Fearing Deckard may give up Stelline or the freedom movement to Wallace, Freysa urges K to kill him.

Luv takes Deckard to meet Wallace, who offers Deckard a duplicate Rachael in exchange for information about his child's whereabouts. He refuses, so Luv kills the duplicate. As Luv transports Deckard to be tortured Off-World, K intercedes. He fights and drowns Luv to death but is severely wounded in the process.

K stages Deckard's death to protect him from Wallace and the replicant freedom movement before taking Deckard to Stelline's office and handing him her toy horse. As K dies on the steps looking up at the falling snow, Deckard enters the building and tearfully meets his daughter for the first time.{{efn|In an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''Blade Runner 2049'' screenwriter Michael Green confirmed that K dies as he lies on the steps.<ref name=""GreenEW"" />}}","Action, Drama, Mystery","starring       = {{Plainlist|

347,The King's Speech,"==Plot==
At the official closing of the [[British Empire Exhibition]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], [[Prince Albert, Duke of York|Prince Albert ""Bertie"", Duke of York]], the second son of [[King George V]], addresses the crowd with a strong [[Stuttering|stammer]]. His search for treatment has been discouraging, but his wife, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth]], persuades him to see Australian-born [[Lionel Logue]], a non-medically trained [[Harley Street]] [[speech defects therapist]]. Bertie believes the first session is not going well, but Lionel has him recite [[Hamlet]]'s ""[[To be, or not to be]]"" soliloquy while listening to classical music over a pair of headphones. Bertie is frustrated but Lionel gives him the [[acetate recording]] that he has made of the reading as a souvenir.

After Bertie's father, King George V, broadcasts his 1934 [[Royal Christmas Message]], he explains to Bertie that the wireless will play a significant part in the role of the royal family, allowing them to enter the homes of the people, and that Bertie's brother's neglect of his responsibilities makes training in it necessary. The attempt at reading the message himself is a failure, but Bertie plays the recording Lionel gave him that night and is astonished at the lack of stutter. He returns for daily treatments to overcome the physical and psychological roots of his stutter.

[[Death and state funeral of George V|George V dies in 1936]]. His eldest son David ascends the throne as [[King Edward VIII]]. A constitutional crisis arises with Edward over a prospective marriage with twice-divorced American socialite [[Wallis Simpson]]. Edward, as the [[supreme governor of the Church of England]], cannot marry her, even if her second divorce occurs, since both her previous husbands are alive.

At an unscheduled session, Bertie expresses frustration that, while his speech has mostly improved, he still stammers when talking to David, simultaneously revealing the extent of Edward VIII's folly with Simpson. When Lionel insists that Bertie himself could make a good king, Bertie accuses Lionel of [[High treason in the United Kingdom|treason]] and angrily quits Lionel. They reconvene after [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|King Edward decides to abdicate]] to marry. Bertie, urged by Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]], ascends the throne as King George VI and visits Lionel's home with his wife before their [[coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth|coronation]], much to the surprise of Mrs. Logue when she learns who Lionel's client has been.

Bertie and Lionel's relationship is questioned by the King's advisors during preparations for his coronation in [[Westminster Abbey]]. The [[archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Cosmo Gordon Lang]], points out that George never sought advice from his advisors about his treatment and that Lionel lacks formal training. Lionel explains to an outraged Bertie that at the time he started with speech defects there were no formal qualifications and that the only known help that was available for returning [[Great War]] [[shell-shock]]ed Australian soldiers was from personal experience. Bertie remains unconvinced until provoked to protest at Lionel's disrespect for [[King Edward's Chair]] and the [[Stone of Scone]]. After realising he has just expressed himself without impairment, Bertie is able to rehearse with Lionel and complete the ceremony.

As king, Bertie has a crisis when he must broadcast to Britain and the [[British Empire|Empire]] following the [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Germany (1939)|declaration of war on Nazi Germany]] in 1939. Lionel is summoned to [[Buckingham Palace]] to prepare the king for his speech. Knowing the challenge that lies before him, Lang, [[Winston Churchill]], and Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] accompany for support. Bertie and Logue are left in the broadcasting room. He delivers his speech with Logue conducting him, but eventually begins speaking freely. Logue mentions that Bertie still struggles enunciating ''w'', to which Bertie replies, ""I had to throw in a few so they'd know it was me.""

As the Royal Family step onto the palace balcony and are applauded by the crowd, a [[title card]] explains that Logue, who was made Commander of the [[Royal Victorian Order]] for services to the Crown, was always present at King George VI's speeches during the war and that they remained friends until [[Death and state funeral of George VI|the King's death]] from lung cancer in 1952.","Biography, Drama, History","starring       = {{Plainlist|

351,Dev.D,"==Plot==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2021}}
The film is divided into three parts from the point of view of the main characters :-

===Paro===
Paro is an idealistic, young, middle-class girl living in Punjab. Her childhood sweetheart is Dev, the son of a rich businessman. Paro cares for him immensely, and fully expects a future with him. Dev constantly takes Paro's love and affection for granted. He grows up to be arrogant and lazy, which causes his father to send him to [[London]] to complete his education. While separated by distance, Paro and Dev's youthful love only blossoms more, despite Dev growing increasingly egotistical and entitled. After finishing his studies, Dev returns to Chandigarh and meets Paro, and they rekindle their romance. After some time, Dev overhears scandalous rumours about Paro, concerning her reputation and sexual history, which he immediately believes despite no evidence. Paro is shocked at his chauvinist attitude towards her, even after she claims innocence. Dev hypocritically passes judgement onto Paro and does not approve of the things that he has heard. Paro turns her back on him when she hears him insult her and rashly agrees to marry a man of her parents' choice. On her wedding day, Dev learns that the rumors were false but his ego doesn't let him accept his mistake, and he lets Paro marry someone else.

===Chanda===
Leni is a Delhi student of half-European descent. A date with her much older boyfriend turns sexual and lands Leni in an [[DPS MMS Scandal|MMS sex scandal]]. The incident becomes public knowledge after the video is widely circulated. Her father, having watched the video, commits suicide out of shame and disgust, and Leni's family decides to send her to live in a small rural town. Refusing to live a life of shame and ridicule, she returns to Delhi where she works as a [[prostitute]] at night, while continuing with her studies during the day. She adopts the name 'Chanda' or 'Chandramukhi' for her profession, after she is seen watching Sanjay Leela Bhansali's adaptation of ''Devdas'' on TV. Her 'foreign' looks mean her services are reserved for the highest-paying customers, and she finds some dignity and independence in the new way of living. One night, an inebriated, half-conscious customer is brought to her room, who turns out to be Dev. She falls in love with him, even though Dev is still in love with Paro.

===Dev===
Dev, tormented by Paro's wedding, has been seeking refuge in alcohol and drugs. He finds some solace with Chanda but is unable to forget Paro. While in a drug-fueled haze, he calls Paro's husband in the middle of the night, Paro visits him at the cheap lodge where he is staying. She shows her love by taking care of Dev spurns his attempts at physical intimacy. Their reunion ends on a bitter note, and Paro returns to her married life. Dev resolves to go back to Chanda, but confronted by the reality of her profession, he abandons her, too. He resumes his destructive lifestyle of alcohol, drugs, and reckless behaviour. Months later, after his life has completely fallen apart and hit an all-time low, Dev attempts to pick up the pieces. He seeks Chanda once again and, with her help, sets out to start life afresh and better himself.

353,My Name Is Khan,"==Plot==
Rizwan Khan, an [[Islam in India|Indian Muslim]], grows up with his younger brother Zakir and his widowed mother Razia in a middle-class family in [[Borivali]], [[Mumbai]]. His [[autism]] leads to special tutoring from a reclusive scholar and extra attention from his mother, all of which leads to a heightened level of jealousy from Zakir, who eventually leaves his family for a life in [[San Francisco]]. Despite this, Zakir sponsors Rizwan to come and live with him after their mother's death. Zakir's wife Hasina diagnoses Rizwan with [[Asperger syndrome]], and Rizwan begins to work for Zakir's company, selling beauty products to salons. He meets and falls in love with Mandira Rathod, a hairdresser and Hindu woman, who has a young son, Sameer, born from a previous marriage. Despite Zakir's uncertainty, Rizwan and Mandira get married and move to Banville, with Mandira and Sam taking Rizwan's surname. They also live next door to the Garrick family; Mark Garrick, the father, is a journalist, and Sam is best friends with their young son Reese.

A few years later, the Khans' life gets disrupted following the [[September 11 attacks]]. Mark goes to [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)|cover the war in Afghanistan]], but dies there. At the same time, the Khans begin to experience [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks#Backlash and hate crimes|post-9/11 prejudice]], and Reese begins to avoid and eventually turn against Sam when his father is killed. In turn, Sam attempts to reconcile with Reese, which one day leads to a confrontation between the two that turns to a fight at their community soccer field, where a group of older students attack Sam, despite Reese's pleas for them to stop. One of them kicks a football at Sam, rupturing his [[spleen]] and killing him. 

A grieving Mandira starts to blame Rizwan, stating that Sam died solely because of Rizwan's surname. She tells Rizwan to ""just go"", as she never wants to see him again, insinuating that their marriage is over. When Rizwan asks when he can come back, Mandira sarcastically says he may as well come back after telling all of America and the [[President of the United States]] that his name is Khan and he is not a terrorist. 

Taking her request seriously, Rizwan ventures out on a road trip to meet President [[George W. Bush]] by following his campaign and fundraiser trail. While hitchhiking across the country, Rizwan earns a living through odd jobs and repairs. During his travels, he passes through Wilhemina, a fictional rural town in Georgia. There, he befriends a boy named Joel after helping him from a bike injury, thus earning the trust of his mother, Jenny, whom Rizwan calls ""Mama Jenny"".

Later, shortly before the president is due to speak, Rizwan enters a mosque in [[Los Angeles]] to pray. While there, he overhears violent rhetoric from a doctor, Faisal Rehman, who is quoting the Hadith but inspiring his followers to enact violence. Rizwan stands up and angrily defies Faisal's statements, shocking the crowd and inspiring debate. He immediately walks out and reports Rehman to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). After doing so, Rizwan makes his way to the front of the crowd at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] to meet President Bush, where he repeatedly calls out, ""My name is Khan and I am not a terrorist!"". The cry confuses and scares the crowd, who disperse in a panic. He is arrested due to misinterpretation as ""I am a terrorist"", and is detained and interrogated for information about [[Al-Qaeda|Al-Queda]], which Rizwan naively wishes he knew more about. He is released after a media campaign by Indian student reporters Raj and Komal, who find a journalist, Bobby Ahuja, to run their story for them. With the help of the students, Bobby Ahuja proves Rizwan's innocence by revealing his attempts to inform the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] about Faisal. 

After his release, Rizwan hears a news report of Wilhelmina being struck by a hurricane. He returns to Georgia to help Mama Jenny and Joel as well as the entirely flooded and destroyed town, thus attracting media attention for his bravery. Reese, seeing Rizwan on TV over weeks of small towns receiving hurricane recovery aid following Rizwan, finally confesses to Mandira his knowledge of what happened to Sam, and reveals the identities of the boys who killed him. Mandira informs Detective Garcia, who has been assisting her on the case, and the boys, including Reese, are arrested.

Mandira reunites with Rizwan in Wilhelmina, Georgia. Right as she arrives, however, Rizwan is stabbed by one of Faisal Rehman's followers who accuses him of being a traitor to Islam, and he is hospitalized. Rizwan survives, and he meets [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Barack Obama]], who tells him: ""Your name is Khan and you are not a terrorist."" Rizwan responds by adding that his son, Sameer, was also not a terrorist; he also relays a sarcastic message that he had promised to relay.",Drama,"starring       = {{ubl|[[Shah Rukh Khan]]|[[Kajol]]}}

355,Slumdog Millionaire,"== Plot ==
In 2006, 18-year-old Jamal Malik, a resident of  the [[Juhu]] slum of [[Mumbai]], is a contestant on ''[[Kaun Banega Crorepati]]''. Before answering the final {{INR|2 crore|link=yes}} question, he is detained and tortured by the [[Mumbai Police|police]], who suspect him of cheating. Through a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], he recounts the incidents in his life that provided him with each answer.

In 1992, five-year-old Jamal obtains the autograph of [[Bollywood]] star [[Amitabh Bachchan]] after jumping into a [[cesspit]]. Jamal's elder brother Salim later sells the autograph. Their mother is killed during the [[Bombay riots]]. While fleeing the riot, the brothers briefly encounter a child dressed up as [[Rama]], with a bow and arrow in their right hand. Having escaped the riots and taken shelter from the rain, the brothers meet Latika, a girl from their slum. Salim is reluctant to take her in, but Jamal suggests that she could be their ""third musketeer"", a reference to the [[Alexandre Dumas]] novel ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' which the brothers had learned about in school. The brothers refer to themselves as [[Armand d'Athos|Athos]] and [[Isaac de Porthau|Porthos]] but do not know the third musketeer's name.

The three children are found by Maman{{mdash}}a [[Organised crime in India|gangster]] who [[Child trafficking in India|trains street children]] to become beggars. After learning that Maman is blinding the children to make them more effective beggars, Salim escapes with Jamal and Latika. The brothers successfully board a moving train, but Latika is unable to keep up. Salim grabs her hand but purposefully lets go as revenge for pulling a prank on him, leaving her to be recaptured by Maman. For the next few years, Salim and Jamal travel on top of trains, making a living by selling goods, [[pickpocketing]], washing dishes, and pretending to be tour guides at the [[Taj Mahal]]. At Jamal's insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika and discover that Maman is raising her to be a [[Prostitution|prostitute]]. The brothers rescue her, Salim shooting Maman dead. Salim gets a job with Javed{{mdash}}a rival crime lord. In their room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him alone with Latika, presumably to sexually assault her. When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him, and Latika persuades Jamal to leave.

In 2004, Jamal, now working as a ''[[chaiwala]]'' in a [[Call center industry in India|call centre]], learns that Salim is a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's crime organisation. Jamal confronts Salim, who pleads for forgiveness. Jamal then sneaks into Javed's residence and reunites with Latika. Although he professes his love for her, she tells him to forget her. Despite the refusal, Jamal promises to wait for her every day at five o'clock at [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus|Victoria Terminus]]. Attempting to meet him there, Latika is captured by Javed's men, led by Salim. He scars her face while driving away. Jamal loses contact with Latika and in a final attempt to reach her, he becomes a contestant on ''Kaun Banega Crorepati'', knowing she watches the show.

Jamal plays extremely well and becomes popular across India, much to the dismay of the show's host, Prem Kumar. Kumar attempts to trick Jamal by feeding him the wrong answer to the penultimate question. However, Jamal answers correctly, raising suspicion of him cheating.

When the episode ends, Jamal is arrested. After an initial [[Battery (crime)|beating]], the police inspector listens to his explanation of how he knew each answer. The officer believes Jamal and allows him to return to the show. Latika sees that Jamal was arrested on the news. Feeling guilty about his past behaviour, Salim gives Latika his phone and car keys, asking her to forgive him. After Latika leaves, Salim fills a bathtub with money and sits in it, waiting for Javed to realise what happened.

For the final question, Jamal is asked the name of the third musketeer. Jamal admits to not knowing the answer and uses his ""Phone-A-Friend"" lifeline to call Salim because it is the only phone number he knows. Latika answers and tells Jamal that she is safe, but does not know the answer. Javed hears Latika on the show and realises that Salim betrayed him. He and his men break down the bathroom door. Salim kills Javed before getting shot and killed by the gang. Relieved about Latika, Jamal guesses and picks the first answer, [[Henri d'Aramitz|Aramis]]. He is correct and wins the grand prize. Jamal and Latika meet on the platform at the train station, kiss, and dance to the song ""[[Jai Ho (song)|Jai Ho]]"" along with all the other characters.","Drama, Romance","starring       = {{Plainlist|

360,Dallas Buyers Club,"==Plot==
In 1985, promiscuous [[Dallas]] electrician and rodeo cowboy [[Ron Woodroof]] is diagnosed with [[HIV/AIDS]] and told that he has about 30 days to live. At first, he refuses to accept the diagnosis until he remembers having unprotected sex with a prostitute who was an [[drug injection|intravenous drug]] user. Woodroof's family and friends ostracize him, mistakenly assuming he contracted AIDS from gay sex. He is fired from his job and evicted from his home. His doctor, Eve Saks, tells him an [[antiretroviral drug]] called [[zidovudine]] (AZT)—the only drug yet approved for testing in human [[clinical trials]] by the [[FDA]]—is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients. Saks informs him that half of the trial patients receive the drug and the other half a [[placebo]] since this is the only way to determine if the drug works.

Woodroof bribes a hospital worker to get him AZT, which, exacerbated by his [[cocaine]] and alcohol abuse, causes his health to deteriorate. Recuperating in the hospital, he meets Rayon, a drug-addicted, HIV-positive [[trans woman]] he is initially hostile toward. As his health worsens, he drives to a makeshift Mexican hospital to get more AZT. The facility is run by an American, Dr. Vass, whose medical license was revoked because his work with people with AIDS had violated US regulations. Vass warns Woodroof against AZT, telling him it is ""poisonous."" Instead, he prescribes a cocktail of drugs and nutritional supplements centered on [[Zalcitabine|ddC]] and the protein [[peptide T]], which are not yet approved for use in the United States by the FDA. Three months later, Woodroof finds his health much improved and realizes he could make money by importing the drugs and selling them to other HIV-positive patients. He is able to get the drugs over the border by masquerading as a priest with cancer and claiming they are for personal use. Dr. Saks starts to notice the adverse effects of AZT, but her supervisor, Dr. Sevard, tells her the trials cannot be discontinued.

Woodroof starts selling the drugs in Dallas on the street, at [[gay nightclub]]s, and [[discotheque]] bars. He reluctantly partners with Rayon since she can bring in more customers. The pair establishes the Dallas Buyers Club, charging $400 per month for membership and giving away the drugs to members to circumvent the laws that made it illegal to sell the drugs. The club is extremely popular, and Woodroof gradually begins to respect Rayon as a friend. When Woodroof is hospitalized for a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] caused by an overdose of recently acquired [[interferon]] from Japan, Dr. Sevard learns of the club and its alternative drugs and is angry that the buyers club is interfering with his trial. The FDA confiscates the interferon and threatens to have Woodroof arrested. Dr. Saks agrees that there are benefits to [[buyers club|clubs]] for HIV drugs but feels powerless to change anything. The process the FDA uses to research, test, and [[Approved drug#United States|approve drugs]] is considered flawed and part of the problem for people suffering from AIDS. At that time, the United States and the FDA were particularly conservative by international standards in testing and approving anti-AIDS drugs. They were hostile to imported drugs to the point they were made contraband.<ref name=""cma"">{{Cite journal |last=Singer |first=Merrill |date=1994-10-01 |title=Aids and the health crisis of the U.S. urban poor; the perspective of critical medical anthropology |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536%2894%2990205-4 |journal=Social Science & Medicine |language=en |volume=39 |issue=7 |pages=931–948 |doi=10.1016/0277-9536(94)90205-4 |pmid=7992126 |issn=0277-9536|citeseerx=10.1.1.454.7720 }}</ref> Dr. Saks and Woodroof begin a friendship.

The FDA gets a warrant to raid the Buyers Club but can do nothing but fine Woodroof. The FDA changes its regulations in 1987, making any unapproved drug illegal. With the club strapped for cash, Rayon begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her [[life insurance]] policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico to get more peptide T. Upon his return, he finds that Rayon has died in the hospital and is extremely upset by her death. Dr. Saks is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she has been sending patients to the buyers club, but she refuses and insists they will have to fire her instead.

After Rayon's death, Woodroof begins to show more compassion toward LGBT members of the club, and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority becomes providing the drugs as peptide T gets increasingly challenging to acquire. Woodroof files a lawsuit against the FDA in late 1987, seeking the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as nontoxic but is still not FDA-approved. The judge is sympathetic toward him and admonishes the FDA but lacks the power to do anything. The FDA later allows Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use. He dies of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially had predicted.","Biography, Drama","starring       = {{plainlist|

361,The Pursuit of Happyness,"== Plot ==
In 1981, [[San Francisco]] salesman [[Chris Gardner]] invests his entire life savings in portable bone-density scanners, which he demonstrates to doctors and pitches as a handy improvement over standard X-rays. The scanners play a vital role in Chris's life. While he can sell most of them, the time lag between the sales and his growing financial demands enrages his bitter and estranged wife, Linda, who works as a hotel maid. The economic instability increasingly erodes their marriage, despite caring for Christopher Jr., their soon-to-be 5-year-old son.

While Chris tries to sell one of the scanners, he meets Jay Twistle, a lead manager and partner for [[Dean Witter Reynolds]] and impresses him by solving a [[Rubik's Cube]] during a taxi ride. After Jay leaves, Chris skips out on paying the fare, causing the driver to angrily chase him into a [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] station; he is forced to leave. However, Chris's new relationship with Jay earns him an interview to become an intern stockbroker.

The day before the interview, Chris grudgingly agrees to paint his apartment for free to postpone eviction by his landlord for late rent. While painting, Chris is greeted by two policemen at his doorstep, who arrest him for failure to pay multiple parking tickets. Chris has to spend the night in jail, complicating his schedule for the interview the next day. Chris narrowly arrives at Dean Witter's office on time, albeit still in shabby, paint-spattered clothes. Despite his appearance, Chris still impresses the interviewers and lands a six-month unpaid internship. He is among 20 interns competing for a paid position as a stockbroker.

A possible position at her sister's boyfriend's restaurant tempts Linda to leave for [[New York City|New York]]. With regret, she leaves Christopher in Chris's care. However, Chris’s financial problems worsen when his already diminished bank account is garnished by the [[IRS]] for unpaid income taxes, and his landlord finally evicts him and Christopher.

With only $21.33 in his bank account, Chris and Christopher are left homeless and desperate; Chris is able to get food and beds at the local shelter, and eventually scraps together cash for a motel room, but the locks are then changed when he can't pay on time; he is then forced to live out of the restrooms in local BART stations with his son. Later, Chris finds the scanner that he lost in the station earlier. He sells his blood to pay for repairs and then gets a local physician to purchase it, thereby freeing himself to focus solely on his stockbroker training.

Disadvantaged by his limited work hours and knowing that maximizing his client contacts and profits is the only way to earn the broker position, Chris develops several ways to make sales calls more efficiently, including reaching out to potential high-value customers in person, a violation of firm protocol. One sympathetic prospect, Walter Ribbon, a top-level pension fund manager, even takes Chris and Christopher to a [[San Francisco 49ers]] game, where Chris befriends some of Mr. Ribbon's friends, who are also potential clients. Regardless of his challenges, Chris never reveals his lowly circumstances to his colleagues, even going so far as to lend one of his supervisors, Mr. Frohm, the last five dollars in his wallet for cab fare. He also studies for and aces the [[Series 7 exam|stockbroker license exam]].

As Chris concludes his last day of internship, he is summoned to a meeting with the partners. Mr. Frohm notes that Chris is wearing a nice shirt, to which Chris explains he thought it appropriate to dress for the occasion on his last day. Mr. Frohm thanks him and says Chris should wear another one the following day, letting Chris know that he has won the coveted full-time position and reimburses Chris for the previous cab ride. Fighting back tears, he shakes hands with the partners, then rushes to Christopher's daycare to embrace him. They walk down a street and joke with each other (and are passed by the real Chris Gardner, in a business suit).

An epilogue reveals that Gardner went on to form his own multimillion-dollar brokerage firm in 1987, and Gardner sold a minority stake in his brokerage firm in a multi-million-dollar deal in 2006.","Biography, Drama","starring       = {{ubl|Will Smith||[[Thandiwe Newton]]||[[Jaden Smith]]}}

362,Blood Diamond,"==Plot==
In 1999, [[Sierra Leone]] is ravaged by [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]]. The [[Revolutionary United Front]] terrorizes the countryside and enslaves many locals to harvest [[Blood diamond|diamond]]s, which fund their increasingly successful war effort. Solomon Vandy, a [[Mende people|Mende]] fisherman from [[Shenge]], is separated from his family and assigned to a workforce overseen by Captain Poison, a ruthless warlord.

While [[Placer mining|mining a river]], Vandy discovers an enormous pink diamond. Captain Poison tries to take the stone, but the area is suddenly raided by government troops. Vandy buries the stone before being captured. Vandy and Poison are incarcerated in [[Freetown]] along with Danny Archer, a [[White people in Zimbabwe|white]] [[Rhodesia]]n [[arms trafficking|gunrunner]] and [[South African Border War|Border War]] veteran jailed for trying to smuggle diamonds into [[Liberia]]. The diamonds were intended for Rudolph van de Kaap, a corrupt [[South Africa]]n mining executive.

Hearing of the pink diamond in prison, Archer arranges for himself and Vandy to be freed. He travels to [[Cape Town]] to meet his employer: Colonel Coetzee, an [[Afrikaner]] formerly with the [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]]-era [[South African Defence Force]] (whom Archer also served under in the [[32 Battalion (South Africa)|32 Battalion]]), who now commands a [[private military company]]. Archer wants the diamond so he can sell it to van de Kaap and retire, but Coetzee wants it as compensation for Archer's botched smuggling mission. Archer returns to Sierra Leone, locates Vandy, and offers to help him find his family if he will help recover the diamond.

The RUF [[Siege of Freetown|conquers Freetown]], while Vandy's son Dia is captured to serve as a [[military use of children|child soldier]] under a liberated Captain Poison. Archer and Vandy narrowly escape to [[Lungi, Sierra Leone|Lungi]], where they plan to reach [[Kono district|Kono]] with the help of an American journalist, Maddy Bowen, in exchange for Archer providing evidence of the illicit diamond trade. Maddy helps Vandy locate his remaining family at a refugee camp in [[Guinea]]. Eventually, the trio arrive in Kono after a harrowing journey, where Coetzee and his private army — contracted by the Sierra Leone government — prepares to repulse the rebel offensive.

While Maddy gets out with her story, the two men set out for Captain Poison's encampment. Dia, stationed with the RUF garrison there, is confronted by Vandy, but having been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] he refuses to acknowledge his father. Archer radios the site's coordinates to Coetzee, who directs a combined air and ground assault on the camp. Vandy finds Captain Poison and beats him to death with a shovel as the mercenaries overwhelm the RUF defenders.

Coetzee then forces Vandy to produce the diamond, but is killed by Archer, who realizes Coetzee would eventually kill them both. Dia briefly holds the pair at gunpoint, but Vandy confronts him again and renews their familial bond. Pursued by vengeful mercenaries, Archer discloses he has been mortally wounded and entrusts the stone to Vandy, telling him to take it for his family. Vandy and his son rendezvous with Archer's pilot, who flies them to safety while Archer makes a final phone call to Maddy; they share final farewells as he asks her to assist Vandy, and gives her permission to finish her article. Archer finally takes in the beautiful African landscape before dying.

Vandy arrives in London and meets with a van de Kaap representative; he exchanges the pink diamond for a large sum of money and being reunited with his entire family. Maddy takes photographs of the deal to publish in her article on the diamond trade, exposing van de Kaap's criminal actions. Vandy appears as a guest speaker at a conference on ""[[blood diamonds]]"" in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], and is met with a standing ovation.","Adventure, Drama, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist|

374,Cinderella Man,"==Plot==
[[James J. Braddock]] is an [[Irish-American]] [[Boxing|boxer]] from [[New Jersey]], formerly a [[light heavyweight]] contender, who is forced to give up boxing after breaking his hand in the ring. This is both a relief and a burden to his wife, Mae. She cannot bring herself to watch the violence of his chosen profession, yet she knows they will not have enough income without his boxing.

As the United States enters the [[Great Depression]], Braddock does [[manual labor]] as a [[longshoreman]] to support his family, even with his injured hand. Unfortunately, he cannot get work every day. Thanks to a last-minute cancellation by another boxer, Braddock's longtime manager and friend, [[Joe Gould (boxing)|Joe Gould]], offers him a chance to fill in for just one night and earn cash. The fight is against the number-two contender in the world, [[Corn Griffin]].

Braddock stuns the boxing experts and fans with a third-round knockout of his formidable opponent. He believes that while his right hand was broken, he became more proficient with his left hand, improving his in-ring ability. Despite Mae's objections, Braddock takes up Gould's offer to return to the ring. Mae resents this attempt by Gould to profit from her husband's dangerous livelihood, until she discovers that Gould and his wife also have been devastated by hard times.

With a shot at the heavyweight championship held by [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]] a possibility, Braddock continues to win. Out of a sense of pride, he uses a portion of his prize money to pay back money to the government given to him while unemployed. When his [[rags to riches]] story gets out, the sportswriter [[Damon Runyon]] dubs him ""The Cinderella Man"", and before long Braddock comes to represent the hopes and aspirations of the American public struggling with the Depression.

After wins against [[John Henry Lewis]] and [[Art Lasky]], a title fight against Baer comes his way. Braddock is a 10-to-1 [[underdog (competition)|underdog]]. Baer is so destructive that the fight's promoter, James Johnston, forces both Braddock and Gould to watch a film of Baer in action, just so he can maintain later that he warned them what Braddock was up against, as Baer had reportedly killed [[Frankie Campbell|2]] [[Ernie Schaaf|men]] in the ring.

Braddock demonstrates no fear. The arrogant Baer attempts to intimidate him, even taunting Mae in public that her man might not survive. When he says this, she becomes so angry that she throws a drink at him. She is unable to attend the fight at the [[Madison Square Garden Bowl]] or even to listen to it on the radio.

On June 13, 1935, in one of the greatest upsets in boxing history, Braddock defeats the seemingly invincible Baer to become the heavyweight champion of the world.

An epilogue reveals that Braddock would lose his title to [[Joe Louis]] (who would later call Braddock ""the most courageous man I ever fought"") and later worked on the building of the [[Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge|Verrazzano Bridge]], owning and operating heavy machinery on the docks where he worked during the Depression, and that he and Mae used his boxing income to buy a house, where they spent the rest of their lives.","Biography, Drama, History","starring       = {{plainlist|

Naina Catherine Kapur is a pessimistic, uptight [[Punjabi Americans|Punjabi American]] [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] student who lives in [[New York City]] with her widowed mother Jennifer, a [[Punjabi Christians|Punjabi Christian]], disabled brother Shiv, adopted sister Jia and paternal grandmother Lajjo, a [[Punjabi Sikhs|Punjabi Sikh]]. Jennifer runs an unsuccessful café with her neighbour, Jaswinder ""Jazz"" Kapoor. Lajjo is hostile to Jennifer and Jia as she believes that Jia's adoption led her son (Jennifer's husband and Naina's father) to commit suicide.

Naina has two best friends: her classmate, Rohit Patel, a [[Gujarati Americans|Gujarati American]], and Jaspreet ""Sweetu"" Kapoor, Jazz's sister. Her life is dull and overshadowed by the loss of her father until Aman Mathur and his mother move in next door with his uncle, Pritam Chaddha.

Naina reveals she is in love with Aman instead. Shaken, Rohit calls Aman to tell him what has happened. Naina goes to Aman's house and is shocked to see a wedding photograph of Aman and his wife, Priya. Heartbroken, she leaves.

Aman's mother confronts him about what has happened. He says he loves Naina but has decided to hide it because he is suffering from a fatal heart condition. He is not actually married.

Shocked, Naina realises that Aman has sacrificed his love for her and leaves the mall in an emotional frenzy. Priya calls up Aman and informs him about what happened. Aman leaves the hospital and meets a frustrated Rohit, who asks why he and not Aman should marry Naina. Aman urges Rohit to marry Naina as a sign of respect for his dying wish to see Naina happy. Aman meets Naina, and they embrace while he tries to persuade her that he does not love her. Rohit and Naina's wedding, which Aman attends, takes place soon afterwards.

Sometime after the wedding, Aman is on his deathbed and says goodbye to everyone. He is left alone with Rohit after Naina leaves the room in tears. Aman makes him promise that, although Naina is with Rohit in this lifetime, he will get her in the next.

377,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words.-->
In the early 18th century, Governor [[Weatherby Swann]] and his daughter, Elizabeth, sail aboard HMS ''Dauntless'' with Lieutenant [[James Norrington|Norrington]] and his crew. They recover a shipwreck survivor, a boy named Will Turner. Elizabeth takes a gold medallion from around Will's neck, before seeing a ship with black sails. Eight years later in Port Royal, Jamaica, Norrington is promoted to [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]]. While the promotion ceremony is taking place, the pirate captain [[Jack Sparrow]] arrives in Port Royal. After the ceremony, Norrington proposes to Elizabeth. Due to her tight-fitting [[corset]], she faints and falls into the ocean, which causes the medallion she is carrying to emit a pulse. Jack rescues Elizabeth before escaping from Norrington, who has identified him as a pirate. Will encounters Jack and duels him until Jack is captured and imprisoned.

That night, Port Royal is attacked by the pirate crew of the ''Black Pearl'', the ship Elizabeth saw years earlier. The pirates are searching for the medallion, and take Elizabeth aboard the ship to meet Captain [[Hector Barbossa|Barbossa]]. He explains that the medallion is one of 882 gold pieces used to bribe [[Hernán Cortés]] to stop his [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|slaughter]] of the [[Aztecs]]. Because of Cortés's greed, the [[Aztec mythology|Aztec gods]] placed a curse upon the gold. Barbossa's crew found the gold at [[Isla de Muerta]], but after spending it, they became immortal zombies. To lift the curse, the crew must return all the gold with an offering of blood from each member. The only member whose blood hasn't been paid yet is ""Bootstrap Bill"", who was lost to the sea. Barbossa intends to use Elizabeth's blood for the ritual, as he believes her to be Bootstrap's child that he gave the last gold piece to.

To save Elizabeth, Will frees Jack from prison. They stage an attempt to steal the ''Dauntless'', which prompts Norrington and his crew to pursue them on HMS ''Interceptor''. Jack and Will then sneak onto the ''Interceptor'' and escape. They head to [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]] to find [[Joshamee Gibbs]] and recruit a crew. On Isla de Muerta, Jack and Will creep into the treasure grotto, where Barbossa fails to lift the curse with Elizabeth's blood. Will and Elizabeth flee with one of the medallions on the ''Interceptor'', while Jack is captured by Barbossa and locked up aboard the ''Pearl''. A battle ensues between the ''Pearl'' and the ''Interceptor''. Will realizes that Barbossa needs his blood for the rite, because Bootstrap was his father, and he surrenders himself to ensure Elizabeth's freedom. Barbossa destroys the ''Interceptor'', takes its crew prisoner, then deposits Jack and Elizabeth on a deserted island. Elizabeth creates a smoke signal, which allows the Navy to find and rescue them. Elizabeth then accepts Norrington's marriage proposal on the condition that he rescue Will from Barbossa.

That night, Jack and Norrington make a plan to ambush the pirates at Isla de Muerta. Norrington, however, plans to attack the pirates himself, and Jack convinces Barbossa to refrain from lifting the curse until after they have killed Norrington's men. Having anticipated the battle to come, Jack secretly palms a medallion so he can be immortal. He then frees Will and duels Barbossa. As Norrington's crew battle the immortal pirates, Elizabeth slips away to free Jack's crew, who flee on the ''Pearl'', leaving her to save Will and Jack by herself. After Elizabeth helps defeat some of Barbossa's crewmen, Jack shoots Barbossa just as Will returns the last of the medallions with their blood, which lifts the curse. Now mortal, Barbossa dies from Jack's gunshot, and the rest of Barbossa's crew are killed or surrender.

At Port Royal, Will declares his love for Elizabeth. He then rescues Jack, who was about to be hanged. After a scuffle, Jack and Will are surrounded by Norrington's soldiers. Elizabeth stands by their side and declares that she will marry Will instead of Norrington. Jack falls into the sea, then is rescued by the ''Black Pearl'', which has a new crew. Norrington decides to give Jack ""one day's head start"" before pursuing him. Governor Swann gives his blessing to Will and Elizabeth, while Jack is made captain of the ''Pearl'' and sails off toward the horizon.","Action, Adventure, Fantasy","starring       = {{Plainlist|

At William Bloom's wedding party, his father Edward recalls the day Will was born, claiming he caught an enormous [[catfish]] using his wedding ring as bait. Will has heard his father's fanciful tales many times, and believes they are lies. Fed up by the stories, Will has a falling out with his father. Three years later, Edward is diagnosed with cancer, prompting Will and his pregnant wife Joséphine to spend time with him in [[Alabama]].

Edward's life is chronicled through flashbacks, beginning with his boyhood encounter with a witch. She shows Edward how he will die, which does not faze him. As he reaches adulthood, he finds his home too confining, and sets out into the world. He meets a giant named Karl, and they begin traveling together. When they find a fork in the road, they take separate paths. Edward traverses a swamp and discovers the hidden town of Spectre, where he befriends the poet Norther Winslow and the mayor's daughter, Jenny. Not ready to settle down, Edward leaves Spectre, but makes a promise to Jenny that he will return.

At Joséphine's request, the bed-ridden Edward tells her how he met his wife, Sandra. In more flashbacks, Edward and Karl visit the Calloway Circus, where Edward falls in love with a beautiful woman. Edward and Karl get jobs in the circus, and the ringmaster Amos Calloway reveals to Edward one detail about the woman each month. Three years later, Edward discovers that Amos is a [[werewolf]], but shows no ill will towards him. In gratitude, Amos reveals the woman's name as Sandra Templeton. Edward confesses his love to Sandra, but she rebuffs him despite his romantic gestures. Sandra's fiancé Don Price beats Edward up, which prompts Sandra to break off their engagement and marry Edward instead.

Frank tells Donnie that the world will end in precisely 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. Donnie wakes up the next morning on the green of a local golf course and returns home to discover a [[jet engine]] has crashed into his bedroom. His older sister Elizabeth tells him the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] investigators do not know its origin.

Over the next several days, Donnie continues to have visions of Frank, and his parents, Eddie and Rose, send him to [[psychotherapist]] Dr. Thurman. Thurman believes Donnie is detached from reality and that his visions of Frank are ""[[hallucination|daylight hallucinations]],"" symptomatic of [[paranoid schizophrenia]]. Frank asks Donnie if he believes in [[time travel]], and Donnie in turn asks his science teacher, Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff. Monnitoff gives Donnie ''The Philosophy of Time Travel'', a book written by Roberta Sparrow, a former science teacher at the school who is now a seemingly senile old woman living outside of town, known to the local teenagers as Grandma Death. Donnie also starts dating Gretchen Ross, who has recently moved into town with her mother under a new identity to escape her violent stepfather.

Frank begins to influence Donnie's actions through his sleepwalking episodes, including causing him to flood his high school by breaking a water main. Gym teacher Kitty Farmer attributes the act of vandalism to the influence of the short story ""[[The Destructors]],"" assigned by dedicated English teacher Karen Pomeroy. Kitty begins teaching ""attitude lessons"" taken from local [[motivational speaker]] Jim Cunningham, but Donnie rebels against these, leading to friction between Kitty and Rose. Kitty arranges for Cunningham to speak at a school assembly, where Donnie insults him. He later finds Cunningham's wallet and address, and Frank suggests setting his house on fire. Firefighters discover a hoard of [[child pornography]] there. Cunningham is arrested, and Kitty, who wishes to testify in his defense, asks Rose to chaperone their daughters' dance troupe on its trip to Los Angeles.

With Rose in Los Angeles and Eddie away for business, Donnie and Elizabeth hold a [[Halloween]] costume party to celebrate Elizabeth's acceptance to [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. At the party, Gretchen arrives distraught as her mother has gone missing, and she and Donnie make love for the first time. When Donnie realizes that Frank's [[Prophecy|prophesied]] end of the world is only hours away, he takes Gretchen and two other friends to see Sparrow. Instead of Sparrow, they find two high school bullies, Seth and Ricky, who are trying to rob Sparrow's home. Donnie, Seth, and Ricky fight in the road in front of her house just as Sparrow returns home. The bullies and Donnie's two friends leave when an oncoming car runs over Gretchen, killing her. The driver turns out to be Elizabeth's boyfriend, Frank Anderson, wearing the same rabbit costume from Donnie's visions. Donnie shoots Frank in the eye with his father's gun and walks home carrying Gretchen's body.

Donnie returns home as a vortex forms over his house. He borrows one of his parents' cars, loads Gretchen's body into it, and drives to a nearby ridge that overlooks the town. There, he watches as the plane carrying Rose and the dance troupe home from Los Angeles gets caught in the vortex's wake, violently ripping off one of its engines and sending it back in time. Events of the previous 28 days unwind. Donnie wakes up in his bedroom, recognizes the date is October 2, and laughs as the jet engine falls into his bedroom, crushing him. Around town, those whose lives Donnie would have touched wake up from troubled dreams. Gretchen rides by the Darko home the following day and learns of Donnie's death. Gretchen asks the neighbor, ""What was his name?"" Gretchen and Rose exchange glances and wave as if they know each other but cannot remember from where.","Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--Per poster billing-->

385,Dancer in the Dark,"==Plot==
In [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] in 1964, Selma Ježková, a [[Czech Americans|Czech immigrant]], has moved to the United States with her 12-year-old son Gene Ježek. They live a life of poverty as Selma works at a factory with her good friend Kathy, whom she nicknames Cvalda. She rents a trailer home on the property of local police officer Bill Houston and his wife, Linda. She is romantically pursued by the shy but persistent Jeff, who also works at the factory.

Selma is gradually losing her vision due to a degenerative eye condition, but still is saving money to pay for an operation that will prevent Gene from sharing her fate. She also takes part in rehearsals for a production of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' and accompanies Kathy to the local cinema, where together they watch Hollywood musicals, as Kathy describes them to her.

In her day-to-day life, Selma slips into daydreams, imagining herself in a musical (""Cvalda""). Jeff and Kathy begin to realize that Selma's vision is worse than they thought, and that she has been memorizing eye charts in order to pass vision tests and keep her job. Bill reveals to Selma that Linda's excessive spending has put the couple's house in danger of [[foreclosure]] by their bank. He has contemplated suicide but cannot bring himself to carry out the act. Selma promises to keep his secret and confides in him about her advancing vision loss. Bill quietly stays without knowing that Selma still sees him and watches her hide her money in a tin.

The next day, Selma's boss Norman believes that her eye condition has deteriorated; he accepts her [[resignation]] and pays her final wages, but promises to re-hire her once her sight has improved. However, Kathy accuses him of firing her. Not willing to get her job back, Jeff tries to escort her home by car, but she walks home along a railroad bridge instead (""[[I've Seen It All]]""). Opening the tin to add her money to it, Selma finds it empty. Realizing that Bill has robbed her, she goes to his house to confront him. Linda accuses Selma of trying to [[seduce]] her husband, explaining that Bill told her Selma wanted him for his money. Not wanting to reveal her knowledge of the impending foreclosure, Selma ignores Linda and confronts Bill about the theft. They fight over the money, with Bill drawing a gun only to be accidentally shot by Selma.

Bill yells for Linda to call the police, saying that Selma has tried to rob him, then begs Selma to kill him, telling her it is the only way she will ever reclaim her stolen money. Selma shoots Bill several times, but only wounds him further due to her poor vision, and finally beats him to death with her safe deposit box once the gun runs out of ammunition. She imagines that Bill's corpse stands up and [[slow dance]]s with her, and he and Linda absolve her of blame and tell her she just did what she had to do (""Smith & Wesson""). Taking her money back, she flees the house and pays for Gene's operation in advance.

Not knowing about the murder, Jeff takes Selma to rehearsal, where her director calls the police to have her arrested (""In the Musicals, Part 1""). In court, she is accused of being a [[Communism|Communist]] sympathizer and of pretending to be blind to exploit the American healthcare system. Although she tells as much truth about the situation as she can, she refuses to reveal Bill's secret, saying that she had promised not to. When her claim of sending all her money to her father in Czechoslovakia is proven false, she is convicted of murder and [[Capital punishment in Washington (state)|sentenced to death]] (""In the Musicals, Part 2""). Kathy and Jeff eventually figure out what happened and recover Selma's money, using it instead to pay for a trial lawyer who can free her. Selma refuses the lawyer, opting to face execution by [[hanging]] rather than let her son go blind, but she is deeply distraught as she awaits her death (""107 Steps""). As Selma reaches the gallows, she begins to panic and the guards strap her to a board. Kathy runs in with news that the operation has saved Gene's vision and gives his glasses to Selma. Relieved, Selma sings a final song on the gallows with no musical accompaniment, but is hanged before she can finish the last verse; the final lines are displayed as the proceedings conclude (""Next to Last Song"").","Crime, Drama, Musical",,"director       = [[Lars von Trier]]

386,The Straight Story,"==Plot==
In [[Laurens, Iowa]], Alvin Straight fails to show up to his regular bar meeting with friends and is eventually found lying on his kitchen floor. His daughter, Rose, takes her reluctant father to see a doctor, who sternly admonishes Alvin to give up tobacco and use a [[walker (mobility)|walker]]; Alvin refuses and instead opts to use two canes. Shortly after, Alvin learns that his brother, Lyle, has suffered a stroke. Longing to visit him, but unable to drive, Alvin develops a plan to travel 240 miles to [[Mount Zion, Wisconsin]] on his riding lawnmower, towing a small homemade travel-trailer along the way. This stirs doubt and worry in the minds of his family, friends, and neighbors.

Alvin's first attempt fails: after experiencing difficulty starting the old mower's motor, he does not get far before the machine breaks down. Alvin arranges for his mower to be transported back home on a flatbed truck, where he later shoots it with a shotgun out of frustration. At the [[John Deere]] dealership, he purchases a used lawn tractor whose transmission is still intact from 1966.

On the side of the highway, Alvin passes a young female hitchhiker who later approaches his campfire. In conversation, Alvin deduces that she is pregnant and has run away from home. Alvin tells her about the importance of family by describing a bundle of sticks that is hard to break compared to a single stick. The next day, Alvin emerges from the trailer to find that she has left him a bundle of sticks tied together. Later, a huge group of [[RAGBRAI]] cyclists raced past him. He arrives at the cyclists' camp and is greeted with applause. That night, he speaks with a pair of friendly cyclists around the campfire about growing old.

The next day, Alvin encounters a distraught woman who has just hit a deer in front of him. She drives away after a tearful rant, and Alvin cooks and eats the deer, mounting the antlers on his trailer as a tribute to the deer and the sustenance it provided. Alvin's brakes fail as he travels down a steep hill; after an intense speedy descent, he manages to stop. A man named Danny helps Alvin get his mower and trailer off the main road, discovering that the mower has transmission problems.

Now beginning to run low on cash, Alvin calls Rose to ask her to send him his [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] check. Danny offers Alvin a ride the rest of the way to Lyle's, but Alvin declines, stating that he prefers to travel his own way. Verlyn, an elderly war veteran, takes Alvin into town for a drink. As Alvin does not drink alcohol, he orders a glass of milk, and the two men exchange traumatic stories about their experiences in [[World War II]].

Alvin's tractor is fixed, and he is presented with an exorbitant bill by the mechanics, who are twins and are constantly bickering. Alvin successfully negotiates the price down and explains his mission to help his brother. Alvin crosses the [[Mississippi River]] and makes camp in a cemetery. He chats with a Catholic priest who recognizes Lyle's name and is aware of his stroke. The priest says that Lyle did not mention he had a brother. Alvin responds that all he wants is to make peace with Lyle after their falling out ten years prior.

Finally arriving in Mount Zion, Alvin stops at a bar to ask for directions to Lyle's house and to have a beer: his first drink in years. Alvin experiences engine trouble just a few miles from Lyle's house and stops in the middle of the road. A tractor driver stops to help, then leads the way to Lyle's house. When he arrives, Alvin finds the house dilapidated. He calls for his brother, who appears to be using a walker and invites Alvin to sit down on the porch. Lyle asks if Alvin had ridden the lawnmower all the way just to see him, to which Alvin simply responds, ""I did, Lyle."" The two men sit together silently and gaze up at the stars.","Biography, Drama","starring       = {{plainlist|

392,Sling Blade,"==Plot==
Karl Childers is a developmentally disabled [[Arkansas]] man whose parents physically and mentally abused him when he was young. He has been in the custody of the state [[mental hospital]] since the age of 12 after murdering his mother and her teenage lover, who was also his tormentor, with a [[sling blade]]. Karl believed his mother was being raped and killed the teen in her defense. When he realized his mother was a willing participant in the affair, Karl killed her as well.

Karl spends his days staring out a window at an open field and rubbing his hands together. As a passive person, he is often forced by fellow patient Charles to listen to stories of him bragging about unsolved crimes of murder rape, who unbeknownst to the hospital was a serial killer. The state determines that Karl is no longer dangerous and releases him. Karl wants to stay and pleads to, but is told that he has to leave. He goes back to his hometown, where he finds work as a small engine mechanic.

Karl befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley and shares details of his past, including the killings. Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda, and her gay best friend and boss, Vaughan. Vaughan is concerned about Karl's history, but Linda asks him to move into her garage, angering her abusive and alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle. Vaughan tells Karl that he fears Doyle could hurt or kill Linda and Frank one day.

Karl becomes a role model to Frank, who misses his deceased father and despises Doyle. As they grow closer, Karl tells Frank that he is haunted by an incident that happened when he was six or eight years old. His parents performed an abortion of his unwanted baby brother and made him dispose of the body. Karl found the baby was still moving and buried him alive. Karl later visits his sickly father and tries to reconcile, but is rejected. He scolds his father for his past cruelty to him and to his brother and says that he thought many times about killing him, but no longer sees the need.

During Doyle's latest drunken outburst, where he refuses to leave Linda's house, Frank fights back. Linda later reconciles with Doyle, who announces that he is moving in with them. He tells Karl that he is no longer welcome. When Frank protests, Doyle grabs him, but Karl intervenes and warns him never to touch Frank again. Doyle insists that he is in charge and orders Karl to leave.

Realizing that an unhappy childhood or worse awaits Frank, Karl persuades him and Linda to spend the night at Vaughan's house. Karl asks Vaughan to promise to look after Frank and Linda. Later that evening, he returns to the Wheatley home carrying a sharpened lawn mower blade, and finds Doyle drunk and alone in the living room. Karl kills Doyle, calls [[9-1-1]], and then eats biscuits with mustard, a childhood favorite, while waiting for the police.

Karl is returned to the state hospital, but is now more assertive. Charles tells him more private stories about unsolved crimes involving sexual violence, and then questions him about his relationship with Frank. This angers Karl, who tells Charles to never speak to him again. As Charles walks away, Karl turns towards him and then resumes looking out of the window toward the open field.",Drama,"starring       = {{Plainlist|

Twenty-five-year-old Mookie lives in [[Bedford–Stuyvesant]] with his sister Jade, has a toddler son named Hector with his Latina girlfriend Tina, and works as a delivery man at a pizzeria owned by [[Italian-American]] Salvatore ""Sal"" Frangione. Sal's oldest son, Pino, is a racist who holds contempt for all the neighborhood blacks. Sal's younger son, Vito, is friends with Mookie, which Pino feels undermines their fraternal bond.

Other residents of the neighborhood include friendly drunk Da Mayor; Mother Sister, who observes the block from her [[brownstone]]; [[Radio Raheem]], who blasts [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s ""[[Fight the Power (Public Enemy song)|Fight the Power]]"" on his [[boombox]]; Buggin' Out, a fast-talking young man who talks about Black civil rights to anyone who'll listen; Smiley, a [[mentally disabled]] man who meanders around town with hand-colored pictures of [[Malcolm X]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]; and local DJ Mister Señor Love Daddy.

At Sal's, Buggin' Out questions Sal about his ""Wall of Fame"", decorated with photos of famous Italian-Americans, and demands that Sal put up pictures of Black celebrities since the pizzeria is in a Black neighborhood. Sal refuses, feeling he's not required to put anyone but Italians on the wall, and ejects him. Buggin' Out attempts to start boycotting the pizzeria but only Raheem joins him.

During the day, local teenagers open a fire hydrant to beat the heat wave before white police officers Mark Ponte and Gary Long intervene. Mookie confronts Pino about his contempt towards African-Americans. Later, Pino expresses his hatred for African-Americans to Sal, who insists on keeping the business in the [[African-American neighborhood|majority African-American]] neighborhood.

That night, Buggin' Out and Raheem march into Sal's and demand that the Wall of Fame include Black celebrities. Sal demands that Raheem turn his boombox off, but he refuses. Buggin' Out badmouths Sal and threatens to shutter the pizzeria for good. Finally, Sal snaps and smashes Raheem's boombox. Enraged, Raheem attacks Sal. A fight ensues that spills out into the street, attracting a crowd. The police arrive, including Long and Ponte, who break up the fight and apprehend Raheem and Buggin' Out. As the officers attempt to restrain Raheem, Long begins choking him with his nightstick. Though Ponte and the onlookers plead for him to stop, Long tightens his choke-hold on Raheem, killing him. Attempting to save face, the duo place his body in the back of a [[police car]] and drive off.

The onlookers blame Sal for Raheem's death, but Da Mayor unsuccessfully tries to convince the crowd of Sal's innocence. Suddenly, Mookie grabs a trash can and throws it through the pizzeria's window, sparking the crowd to destroy it. Smiley sets the building ablaze, and Da Mayor pulls Sal, Pino, and Vito away from the mob, which turns towards the Korean market across the street to destroy it too. Sonny, the owner, eventually dissuades the group.

The police return with the fire department and riot patrols to extinguish the fire and disperse the crowd. The firefighters, after several warnings to the crowd, turn their hoses on the mob, enraging them and causing more arrests. The next day, Mookie returns to Sal and demands his weekly pay. After an argument, Sal pays Mookie and the two cautiously reconcile. Mookie leaves to visit Hector as Mister Señor Love Daddy announces that the mayor of [[New York City]] has founded a committee to investigate the incident and dedicates a song to Raheem.

Before the credits roll are two quotations that demonstrate the dichotomy of the film's theme: The first, from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who argues that violence is never justified. The second, from Malcolm X, argues that violence is not violence, but ""intelligence"" when it is used in self-defense. The film ends with dedications to six Black people, five—[[Eleanor Bumpurs]], Arthur Miller Jr., [[Edmund Perry]], Yvonne Smallwood, and [[Death of Michael Stewart|Michael Stewart]]—killed by police officers and one—[[Michael Griffith (manslaughter victim)|Michael Griffith]]—killed by a white mob, before fading to black.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/the-enduring-urgency-of-spike-lees-do-the-right-thing-at-thirty|title=The Enduring Urgency of Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" at Thirty|first=Richard|last=Brody|date=June 28, 2019|magazine=The New Yorker|url-access=limited|access-date=January 25, 2024}}</ref>","Comedy, Drama","starring       = {{Plain list|

Arrogant collectibles dealer Charlie Babbitt is in the middle of importing four [[Grey import vehicle|grey market]] [[Lamborghini]]s to [[Los Angeles]] for resale. He needs to deliver the cars to impatient buyers who have already made down payments to repay the loan he took out to buy them, but the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] is holding the cars at the port because they have failed [[Vehicle emission standard|emission tests]]. Charlie directs an employee to lie to the buyers while he stalls his creditor.

When Charlie learns that his estranged father Sanford Babbitt has died, he and his girlfriend Susanna travel to [[Cincinnati]] to settle the estate. He inherits only a group of rosebushes and a classic 1949 [[Buick Roadmaster#1949–1953|Buick Roadmaster]] convertible over which he and Sanford had clashed, while the remainder of the $3 million estate is going to an unnamed [[trustee]]. He learns that the money is being directed to a local [[Psychiatric hospital|mental institution]], where he meets his elder brother Raymond, of whom he was unaware.

Raymond is an [[Autism spectrum|autistic]] [[savant syndrome|savant]] and adheres to strict routines. He has [[Eidetic memory|superb recall]], but he shows little emotional expression, except when in distress. Charlie spirits Raymond out of the mental institution and into a hotel for the night. Disheartened with the way Charlie treats Raymond, Susanna leaves him. Charlie asks Raymond's doctor, Dr. Gerald Bruner, for half the estate in exchange for Raymond's return, but Bruner refuses. Charlie decides to attempt to gain custody of his brother to get control of the money.

After Raymond [[Fear of flying|refuses to fly]] to Los Angeles, he and Charlie resort to driving there instead. They make slow progress because Raymond insists on sticking to his routines, which include watching ''[[The People's Court]]'' on television every day, getting to bed by 11:00&nbsp;p.m., and refusing to travel when it rains. He also objects to traveling on the [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate]] after they encounter a car accident.

During the course of the journey, Charlie learns more about Raymond, including his ability to instantly [[mental calculator|perform complex calculations]] and [[Subitizing|count hundreds of objects at once]], far beyond the normal range of human abilities. He also realizes that Raymond had lived with the family as a child and was the ""Rain Man"" (Charlie's infantile pronunciation of ""Raymond""), a comforting figure Charlie had remembered as an imaginary friend. Raymond had saved an infant Charlie from being scalded by hot bathwater one day, but Sanford blamed Raymond for nearly injuring Charlie, and committed him to the institution, as he was unable to speak up for himself and correct the misunderstanding.

Charlie's creditor [[repossession|repossesses]] the Lamborghinis, forcing him to refund his buyers' down payments and leaving him deeply in debt. Having passed [[Las Vegas]], he and Raymond return to [[Caesars Palace]] and devise a plan to win the needed money by playing [[blackjack]] and [[card counting|counting cards]]. Although the casino bosses obtain videotape evidence of the scheme and ask them to leave, Charlie successfully wins $86,000 to cover his debts. He also reconciles with Susanna, who has rejoined the brothers in Las Vegas.

Returning to Los Angeles, Charlie meets with Bruner, who offers him $250,000 to walk away from Raymond. Charlie refuses, saying he is no longer upset about being cut out of his father's will, but he wants to have a relationship with his brother. At a meeting with a court-appointed psychiatrist, Raymond proves to be unable to decide for himself what he wants. Charlie stops the questioning and tells Raymond he is happy to have him as his brother.

409,Au revoir les enfants,"==Plot==
During the winter of 1943–44, Julien Quentin, a student at a [[Carmelite]] boarding school in occupied France, is returning to school from vacation. He acts tough to the other students, but is actually a pampered boy who misses his mother deeply. Saddened to be returning to the monotony of [[boarding school]], Julien's classes seem uneventful until Père Jean, the headmaster, introduces three new pupils. One of them, Jean Bonnet, is the same age as Julien. Like the other students, Julien at first despises Bonnet, a socially awkward boy with a talent for arithmetic and playing the piano.

One night, Julien wakes up and finds Bonnet wearing a [[kippah]] and praying in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. After digging through his new friend's locker, Julien learns the truth. His real name is not Bonnet, but Kippelstein. Père Jean, a compassionate, sacrificing priest at the school, had agreed to grant secret asylum to hunted Jews. After a game of [[Treasure hunt (game)|treasure hunt]], Julien and Jean bond and develop a close friendship.

When Julien's mother visits on Parents' Day, Julien asks his mother if Bonnet, whose parents could not come, could accompany them to lunch at a gourmet restaurant. As they sit around the table, the talk turns to Julien's father, a factory owner. When Julien's brother asks if he is still for [[Philippe Pétain|Marshal Pétain]], Madame Quentin responds, ""No one is anymore."" The [[Milice]] arrive and attempt to expel a Jewish diner. When Julien's brother calls them ""''[[Collaborationism|Collabos]]''"", the Milice commander is enraged and tells Madam Quentin, ""We serve France, madam. He insulted us."" But when a [[Wehrmacht]] officer coldly orders them to leave, the Milice officers grudgingly obey. Julien's mother comments that the Jewish diner appears to be a very distinguished gentleman. She insists that she has nothing against Jews, but would not object if the [[socialist]] politician [[Léon Blum]] were hanged.

Shortly thereafter, Joseph, the school's assistant cook, is exposed for selling the school's food supplies on the [[Black market in wartime France|black market]]. He implicates several students as accomplices, including Julien and his brother, François. Although Père Jean is visibly distressed by the injustice, he fires Joseph but does not expel the students for fear of offending their wealthy, influential parents.

On a cold morning in January 1944, the [[Gestapo]] raid the school, searching for Jean Kippelstein. As his classroom is being searched, Julien unintentionally gives away Bonnet by looking in his direction. As the other two Jewish boys are hunted down, Julien encounters the person who denounced them, Joseph the kitchen hand. Trying to justify his betrayal in the face of Julien's mute disbelief, Joseph tells him, ""Don't act so pious. There's a war going on, kid."" Disgusted, Julien runs off. Jean and Julien exchange books, a shared habit of theirs, as they pack away their belongings due to the closure of the school.

As the students are lined up in the school courtyard, a Gestapo officer denounces Père Jean's actions and calls French people weak and undisciplined. A moment later, Père Jean, followed by the three Jewish boys in single file is led away across the school yard. One by one, as the priest passes through their midst, the students spontaneously call out to him, ""''Au revoir, mon père!''"" He pauses and half turns towards them and gives a loud reply: ""''Au revoir, les enfants! À bientôt!''"" Jean is the last to exit the school grounds through a metal door in the garden wall. As he steps through the doorway, he glances back for a moment toward Julien, and Julien gives him a timid wave in return.

The film ends with an older Julien providing a voiceover epilogue, in which he mentions that Bonnet, Negus and Dupre died at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], whereas Père Jean died at [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]]; the school reopened in October. He explains that although more than 40 years have passed, he will remember every second of that January morning until the day he dies.","Drama, War","starring       = [[Gaspard Manesse]]<br />[[Raphaël Fejtö|Raphaël Fejtő]]<br />[[Philippe Morier-Genoud]]<br />[[Francine Racette]]

A cyborg is sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 [[Los Angeles]]: an assassin dubbed ""[[Terminator (character)|The Terminator]]"", disguised as a human male and programmed to hunt and assassinate a woman named [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]]. Separately, a human soldier named [[Kyle Reese]] also arrives, intent on stopping the fiend, as they both steal ammunition and clothing. After searching for addresses in a [[telephone directory]], the Terminator systematically dispatches similarly-named women before locating the actual Sarah at a local [[nightclub]], but she is rescued by Reese. The duo then steal a car and escape, with the Terminator pursuing them in a stolen [[police car]].

As they hide in a parking lot, Reese explains to Sarah that an artificially intelligent defense network known as [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]], created by Cyberdyne Systems, will soon become self-aware and trigger a global nuclear war to bring humankind to its extinction. Sarah's future son, [[John Connor|John]], will rally the survivors and lead a successful resistance movement against Skynet and its mechanical forces. On the verge of the resistance's victory, Skynet sends the Terminator back in time to eliminate Sarah, thereby preventing John's birth. The Terminator is an efficient and relentless killing machine with a perfect voice-mimicking ability and a durable metal [[endoskeleton]] covered by living tissue to appear human.

The Terminator tracks Reese and Sarah down, but the duo lose it after a brief car chase. The police apprehend Reese and Sarah and interrogate Reese, but they disbelieve his story. The Terminator discovers Sarah is inside the police station and attacks it, killing many officers while hunting for her. Reese and Sarah escape, steal another car and take refuge in a [[motel]], where they assemble several [[pipe bomb]]s and plan their next move. Reese admits that he has adored Sarah since he saw her in John's photograph and that he traveled through time out of love for her. Reciprocating his feelings, Sarah kisses him and they have [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], conceiving John.

The Terminator locates Sarah by intercepting a call intended for her mother. She and Reese escape the motel in a pickup truck while it pursues them on a motorcycle. In the ensuing chase, Reese is badly wounded by gunfire while throwing pipe bombs at the Terminator. She knocks the Terminator off its motorcycle but loses control of the truck, which flips over. The Terminator, now bloodied and badly damaged, hijacks a [[tank truck]] and attempts to run down Sarah. Reese manages to insert a pipe bomb into the truck's hose tube, causing the truck to explode and reduce the Terminator to its endoskeleton. It pursues them into a Cyberdyne-owned factory, where Reese activates machinery to confuse it, but it eventually discovers them. Reese then lodges his final pipe bomb into its midsection to blow it apart, but at the cost of his life. Its still-functional torso then pursues Sarah, but she manages to lure it into a [[hydraulic press]] that she uses to destroy it.

Months later, Sarah, visibly pregnant with John, travels through [[Mexico]], recording [[cassette tape|audio tapes]] to pass on to him. At a gas station, a boy takes a [[instant film|polaroid]] photograph of her, the exact one that John will one day give to Reese, and she buys it. The gas station owner comments that a storm is coming and she replies that she is aware, alluding to humanity's impending conflict against Skynet, before driving away towards it.","Action, Sci-Fi","starring       = {{Plainlist|

413,Kagemusha,"==Plot==
During the [[Sengoku period]], in 1571, [[Takeda Shingen]], ''[[daimyō]]'' of [[Kai province]] from the [[Takeda clan]], meets a thief his brother [[Takeda Nobukado|Nobukado]] has spared from [[Crucifixion#Japan|crucifixion]] due to the thief's uncanny resemblance to Shingen. The brothers agree that he would prove useful as a double, and they decide to use the thief as a ''kagemusha'', a political decoy. Later, while the Takeda army [[Battle of Mikatagahara|lays siege]] to a castle belonging to [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], Shingen is shot while listening to a flute playing in the enemy camp. He orders his forces to withdraw and, before succumbing to his wound, commands his generals to keep his death a secret for three years. Meanwhile, Shingen's rivals [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], and [[Uesugi Kenshin]] puzzle over the reason for Shingen's withdrawal, unaware of his death.

Nobukado presents the thief to [[Twenty-Four Generals of Takeda Shingen|Shingen's generals]], proposing to have him impersonate Shingen full-time. Although the thief is unaware of Shingen's death initially, he eventually finds Shingen's preserved corpse in a large jar, having believed it to contain treasure. The generals then decide they cannot trust the thief and release him. Later, the jar is dropped into [[Lake Suwa]], which spies working for the Tokugawa and Oda forces witness. Suspecting that Shingen has died, the spies go to report their observation, but the thief, having overheard the spies, returns to the Takeda forces and offers to work as a ''kagemusha''. The Takeda clan preserves the deception by announcing that they were simply making an offering of [[sake]] to the god of the lake, and the spies are ultimately convinced by the thief's performance.

Returning home, the ''kagemusha'' successfully deceives Shingen's [[retinue]] by imitating the late warlord's gestures and learning more about him. When the ''kagemusha'' must preside over a clan meeting, he is instructed by Nobukado to remain silent until Nobukado brings the generals to a consensus, whereupon the ''kagemusha'' will simply agree with the generals' plan and dismiss the council. However, Shingen's son [[Takeda Katsuyori|Katsuyori]] is incensed by his father's decree of the three year subterfuge, which delays his inheritance and leadership of the clan. Katsuyori thus decides to test the ''kagemusha'' in front of the council, as the majority of the attendants are still unaware of Shingen's death. He directly asks the ''kagemusha'' what course of action should be taken, but the ''kagemusha'' is able to answer convincingly in Shingen's own manner, which further convinces the generals.

In 1573, Nobunaga mobilizes his forces to attack [[Azai Nagamasa]], continuing his campaign in central [[Honshu]] to maintain his control of [[Kyoto]] against the growing opposition. When the Tokugawa and Oda forces launch an attack against the Takeda, Katsuyori begins a counter-offensive against the advice of his generals. The ''kagemusha'' is then forced to lead reinforcements in the [[Battle of Takatenjin]], and he helps inspire the troops to victory. However, in a later fit of overconfidence, the ''kagemusha'' attempts to ride Shingen's notoriously temperamental horse, and falls off. When those who rush to help him see that he does not have Shingen's battle scars, he is revealed as an impostor, and is driven out in disgrace, allowing Katsuyori to take over the clan. Sensing weakness in the Takeda clan leadership, the Oda and Tokugawa forces are emboldened to begin a full-scale offensive into the Takeda homeland.

By 1575, now in full control of the Takeda army, Katsuyori leads a counter-offensive against Nobunaga in [[Battle of Nagashino|Nagashino]]. Although courageous in their assault, several waves of Takeda cavalry and infantry are cut down by volleys of [[Tanegashima (gun)|gunfire]] from Oda [[arquebus]]iers deployed behind wooden stockades, effectively eliminating the Takeda army. The ''kagemusha'', who has followed the Takeda army, desperately takes up a spear and charges toward the Oda lines before being shot himself. Mortally wounded, the ''kagemusha'' attempts to retrieve the ''[[fūrinkazan]]'' banner, which had fallen into a river, but succumbs to his wounds in the water where his body is carried away by the current.

==Production==
[[File:KAGEMUSHA 2.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Kurosawa's own artwork]]
[[George Lucas]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]] are credited at the end of the film as [[executive producer]]s in the international version. This is because they persuaded [[20th Century Studios|20th Century-Fox]] to make up a shortfall in the film's budget when the original producers, [[Toho Studios]], could not afford to complete the film. In return, 20th Century-Fox received the international distribution rights to the film. Coppola and Kurosawa appeared together in [[Suntory]] whisky commercials to raise money for the production.<ref>Conrad, David A. (2022). ''Akira Kurosawa and Modern Japan'', 195 McFarland & Co.</ref>

Kurosawa originally cast the actor [[Shintaro Katsu]] in the title role. Katsu left the production, however, before the first day of shooting was over; in an interview for the [[Criterion Collection]] DVD, executive producer [[Francis Ford Coppola|Coppola]] states that Katsu angered Kurosawa by arriving with his own camera crew to record Kurosawa's filmmaking methods. It is unclear whether Katsu was fired or left of his own accord, but he was replaced by [[Tatsuya Nakadai]], a well-known actor who had appeared in a number of Kurosawa's previous films. Nakadai played both the ''kagemusha'' and the lord whom he impersonated.

Kurosawa wrote a part in ''Kagemusha'' for his longtime regular actor [[Takashi Shimura]], and ''Kagemusha'' was the last Kurosawa film in which Shimura appeared. However, the scene in which he plays a servant who accompanies a western doctor to a meeting with Shingen was cut from the foreign release of the film. The [[Criterion Collection]] [[DVD]] release of the film restored this scene as well as approximately another eighteen minutes in the film.

According to Lucas, Kurosawa used 5,000 extras for the final battle sequence, filming for a whole day, then he cut it down to 90 seconds in the final release. Many special effects, and a number of scenes that filled holes in the story, landed on the ""[[cutting-room floor]]"".","Drama, History, War","starring       = [[Tatsuya Nakadai]]

414,Being There,"==Plot==
<!--- DO NOT ADD BEYOND 700 WORDS; PLOTS ARE GENERALLY 400-700 WORDS; CURRENT COUNT: 700 -->
Middle-aged, simple-minded Chance lives in a wealthy old man's townhouse in Washington, D.C., along with the man's African-American maid Louise, who is kind to Chance. He has spent his whole life tending the garden and never left the property. Other than gardening, his knowledge is derived entirely from television. When the old man dies, his estate lawyers order Chance out.

He wanders aimlessly, discovering the outside world for the first time. An African-American youth points a knife at him; Chance ineffectually tries to click him out of existence with a TV remote control. Passing by a TV shop, Chance sees himself captured by a video camera in the shop window. Entranced, he steps backward off the sidewalk and is struck by a limousine chauffeuring Eve Rand, the glamorous and much younger wife of elderly business mogul Ben Rand. When she asks him his name she mishears ""Chance, the gardener"" as ""Chauncey Gardiner"".

Eve brings Chance to their palatial estate to be seen by Dr. Allenby, who is resident there caring for Ben, who is slowly dying from [[Aplastic anemia|a blood disease]]. After checking Chauncey out, the doctor invites him to stay to keep an eye on him.

Chauncey's manners are old-fashioned and courtly, and he wears expensively-tailored but outmoded 1930s clothes he took from his former employer's attic. When Ben meets him he takes ""Chauncey"" for an upper-class, highly-educated businessman fallen on hard times. Ben admires him, finding him direct, wise and insightful.

Ben is also a confidant and advisor to the President of the United States, whom he introduces to Chauncey. In a discussion about the economy, Chance takes his cue from the words ""stimulate growth"" and talks about the changing seasons of the garden. The President misinterprets this as optimistic political advice and quotes ""Chauncey Gardiner"" in a speech.

Chance now rises to national prominence, attends important events, develops a close connection with the Soviet ambassador, and appears on a talk show during which his detailed advice about what a serious gardener should do is misunderstood as his opinion on presidential policy. Louise tells other African Americans as they watch Chance on TV that he has ""rice pudding between the ears"" and that whiteness is all that is needed to succeed in America. The President is shown as sexually impotent with his wife when watching the show.

Though Chance has now risen to the pinnacle of Washington society, the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] and 16 foreign agencies are unable to find any background information on him. Meanwhile, Allenby becomes increasingly suspicious that Chance is not a wise political expert and that his mysterious identity may have a more mundane explanation. Allenby considers telling Ben, but remains silent when he realizes how happy Chance is making him in his final days.

The dying Ben encourages Eve to become close to ""Chauncey"". She is already attracted to him and makes a sexual advance. Chance has no interest in or knowledge of sex, but mimics a kissing scene from the 1968 film ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'', which happens to be on TV. When the scene ends, Chance stops suddenly and Eve is confused. She asks what he likes, meaning sexually; he replies ""I like to watch,"" meaning television. She is momentarily taken aback, but masturbates for his voyeuristic pleasure, not noticing he has turned back to the TV and is imitating ''[[Lilias, Yoga and You]]'' on another channel.

Chance is present at Ben's death and shows genuine sadness. Questioned by Allenby, he admits that he ""loves Eve very much"" and also that he is just a gardener. When he leaves to inform Eve of Ben's death, Allenby says to himself, ""I understand.""

While the President delivers a speech at Ben's funeral, the pallbearers hold a whispered discussion over potential replacements for the President in the next presidential term, and unanimously agree on ""Chauncey"" as successor. Oblivious, Chance wanders off through Ben's wintry estate. He straightens out a pine sapling flattened by a fallen branch, then [[Jesus walking on water|walks across the surface of a lake]] without sinking. He pauses, dips his umbrella deep into the water to the right of his path, then continues on, while the President is heard quoting Ben: ""Life is a state of mind.""","Comedy, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|

415,Annie Hall,"==Plot==
Comedian Alvy Singer is trying to understand why his relationship with Annie Hall ended a year ago. Growing up in [[Brooklyn]], he vexed his mother with impossible questions about the emptiness of existence, but he was precocious about his innocent sexual curiosity, suddenly kissing a classmate at six years old and not understanding why she was not keen to reciprocate.

Annie and Alvy, waiting in a cinema queue to see ''[[The Sorrow and the Pity]]'', overhear another man deriding the work of [[Federico Fellini]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]]. Alvy imagines McLuhan himself stepping in at his invitation to criticize the man's comprehension. That night, Annie shows no interest in sex with Alvy. Instead, they discuss his first wife, whom he kept at a distance for no good reason. His second marriage was to a New York writer who did not share his enthusiasm for sports and was unable to reach orgasm.

With Annie, it is different. The two of them have fun cooking a meal of boiled lobster together. He teases her about the unusual men in her past. They had met playing [[tennis doubles]] with friends. Following the game, awkward small talk leads her to offer him a ride uptown, and then a glass of wine on her balcony. There, what seemed a mild exchange of trivial personal data is revealed in ""mental subtitles"" as an escalating flirtation. Their first date follows Annie's singing audition for a nightclub (""[[It Had to Be You (song)|It Had to be You]]""). After their lovemaking that night, Alvy is ""a wreck,"" while Annie relaxes with a [[cannabis (drug)|joint]].

Soon, Annie admits she loves Alvy, while he buys her books on death and says that his feelings for her are more than just love. When Annie moves in with him, things become very tense. Eventually, Alvy finds her arm-in-arm with one of her college professors, and the two begin to argue about whether this is the ""flexibility"" they had discussed. They eventually break up, and he searches for the truth of relationships, asking strangers on the street about the nature of love, questioning his formative years, and imagining a cartoon version of himself arguing with a cartoon Annie portrayed as the [[Evil Queen]] in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]''.

Alvy attempts a return to dating, but the effort is marred by [[neuroticism|neurosis]] and an episode of bad sex that is interrupted when Annie calls in the middle of the night, insisting that he come over immediately to kill a spider in her bathroom. A reconciliation follows, coupled with a vow to stay together, come what may. However, their separate discussions with their therapists make it evident there is an unspoken and unbridgeable divide. When Alvy accepts an offer to present an award on television, they travel to Los Angeles with Alvy's friend Rob. However, on the return trip, they agree that their relationship is not working. After losing Annie to her record producer Tony Lacey, Alvy unsuccessfully tries rekindling the flame with a marriage proposal. Back in New York, he stages a play of their relationship, but he changes the ending: now she accepts.

The last meeting between Annie and Alvy is a wistful coda on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper West Side]] after they have both moved on to someone new. Alvy's voice returns with a summation: Love is essential, especially if it is neurotic. Annie sings ""[[Seems Like Old Times (song)|Seems Like Old Times]],"" and the credits roll.","Comedy, Romance","starring       = {{Plainlist|

417,Dog Day Afternoon,"== Plot ==
On August 22, 1972, first-time crook [[John Wojtowicz|Sonny Wortzik]] and his friends [[Salvatore Naturile|Salvatore ""Sal"" Naturile]] and Stevie attempt to rob the First Brooklyn Savings Bank. The plan immediately goes awry when Stevie loses his nerve and flees. Sonny discovers that they arrived after the daily cash pickup, and they find only $1,100 in cash.

Sonny takes the bank's [[Traveller's cheque|traveler's checks]] and burns the register in a trash can, but the smoke raises suspicion outside, and the building is surrounded by police. The two panicked robbers take the bank employees hostage.

Police Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti calls the bank, and Sonny bluffs that he is prepared to kill the hostages. Sal assures Sonny that he is ready to kill if necessary. A security guard has an [[asthma]] attack, so Sonny releases him as a display of good faith. Moretti convinces Sonny to step outside. Using the head teller as a shield, Sonny begins a dialogue with Moretti that culminates in his shouting, ""Attica! Attica!"", to invoke the recent [[Attica Prison riot]]. The crowd begins to cheer for Sonny.

Sonny demands a vehicle to drive himself and Sal to the airport, so that they can board a jet. He also demands that pizzas be brought to the hostages, and that his wife be brought to the bank. Sonny's life-partner Leon Shermer arrives and reveals that the robbery was intended to pay for Leon's [[Gender-affirming surgery|sex reassignment surgery]], and he divulges that Sonny has children with his estranged wife Angie.

As night sets in, the bank's lights are shut off as [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Sheldon takes command of the scene. He refuses to give Sonny any more favors, but when the bank manager Mulvaney goes into diabetic shock, Sheldon allows a doctor to go inside. Sheldon convinces Leon to talk to Sonny on the phone. Leon had been hospitalized at [[Bellevue Hospital]] after a [[suicide]] attempt. Leon turns down Sonny's offer to join him and Sal in their escape, and Sonny tells the police that Leon had nothing to do with the robbery.

Sonny agrees to let Mulvaney leave, but the manager refuses to leave his employees. The FBI calls Sonny out of the bank to talk to his mother, who fails to persuade him to surrender. Inside, Sonny dictates his will to one of the hostages, acting as a secretary, leaving money from his life insurance for Angie and for Leon to have the surgery.

When the requested limousine arrives, Sonny checks for hidden weapons or booby traps, and selects Agent Murphy to drive him, Sal and the remaining hostages to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Kennedy Airport]]. Sonny sits in the front beside Murphy, with Sal behind him. Murphy repeatedly asks Sal to point his gun at the roof so that Sal will not accidentally shoot him.

As they wait on the airport tarmac for the plane to taxi into position, Sal releases another hostage, who gives him her rosary beads for his first plane trip. Murphy again reminds Sal to aim his gun away. Sal does, and Sheldon seizes Sonny's weapon, allowing Murphy to pull a revolver hidden in his armrest and shoot Sal in the head. Sonny is immediately arrested, and the hostages are freed.

Sonny watches as Sal's body is taken from the car on a stretcher. We learn that Sonny is sentenced to twenty years in prison, that Angie and her children subsist on welfare, and that Leon is a woman living in New York City.","Biography, Crime, Drama","starring       = {{plainlist|

'''''Dog Day Afternoon''''' is a 1975 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[crime drama]] film directed by [[Sidney Lumet]] and produced by [[Martin Bregman]] and [[Martin Elfand]]. The film stars [[Al Pacino]], [[John Cazale]], [[James Broderick]] and [[Charles Durning]]. The screenplay is written by [[Frank Pierson]] and is based on the ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine article ""The Boys in the Bank"" by [[P. F. Kluge|P.F. Kluge]] and Thomas Moore. The feature chronicles the 1972 robbery and [[hostage|hostage situation]] led by [[John Wojtowicz]] and [[Salvatore Naturile]] at a [[Chase Manhattan Bank|Chase Manhattan]] branch in [[Brooklyn]].

Elfand brought Bregman's attention to the article, who proceeded to negotiate a deal with [[Warner Bros.]] and clear the rights to use the story. Pierson conducted his research and wrote a script that centered on the story of the robbery around Wojtowicz. The cast was selected by Lumet and Pacino, with the latter selecting past co-stars from his [[off-Broadway]] plays. Filming took place between September and November 1974, and the production was finished three weeks ahead of schedule.

When theatrically released on September 21, 1975, ''Dog Day Afternoon'' was a critical and box-office success. The film was nominated for seven [[Golden Globe Awards]] and six [[Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]) and won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]. In 2009, ''Dog Day Afternoon'' was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" by the [[Library of Congress]], and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].

On August 22, 1972, [[John Wojtowicz]], [[Salvatore Naturile]] and Robert Westenberg attempted to rob a branch of the [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] at 450 Avenue P in [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend]], [[Brooklyn]].{{sfn|Associated Press staff|1972|p=1}}{{sfn|UPI staff|p=1|1972}} The robbers aimed to take the US$150,000–$200,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.2|1972|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}) that they expected to be delivered at 3:30&nbsp;p.m. that afternoon by an armored truck. According to Wojtowicz, a Chase Manhattan executive that he met at a [[gay bar]] in [[Greenwich Village]] tipped him off.{{sfn|Meskil, Paul|1972|p=2C}} They entered the bank at 3:00&nbsp;p.m. to discover that the armored truck had instead taken the money away at 11:00&nbsp;a.m. The robbers took the $29,000 ({{Inflation|US|29,000|1972|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}) that was available at the branch and tried to escape. Westenberg was successful, but Wojtowicz and Naturile were left behind as the police arrived on the scene. The robbery then turned into a [[hostage|hostage situation]].{{sfn|Bell, Arthur|1972|p=30}}

Two hours into the negotiations, Wojtowicz and Naturile extended a list of demands to the police: release Elizabeth Eden (Ernest Aron) from [[Kings County Hospital Center]] in exchange for a hostage, bring hamburgers and Coca-Cola, and provide transportation to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] for them and the hostages. In the words of Wojtowicz: ""I want them to deliver my wife here from King's County hospital. His name is Ernest Aron. It's a guy. I'm gay.""{{sfn|Venema, Vibeke|2015}} They also requested a plane to fly to a safe location, where the unharmed hostages were to be released.{{sfn|Kluge, P.F|Moore, Thomas|1972|p=68–69}} After more than fourteen hours of holding the hostages, Naturile was killed, and Wojtowicz was arrested at Kennedy Airport.{{sfn|New York Times staff|1973|p=81}}{{sfn|Mulligan, Arthur|1972|p=1}}

Wojtowicz told Judge [[Anthony J.

=== Development ===
''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' published in its September 22, 1972, issue a chronicle of the robbery. The feature, written by [[P. F. Kluge|P.F. Kluge]] and Thomas Moore, was titled ""The Boys in the Bank"". It detailed the holdup and the hostages' eventual [[Stockholm syndrome|fraternization with their captors]].{{sfn|Kluge, P.F|Moore, Thomas|1972|p=66}} The authors compared Wojtowicz's appearance to that of [[Dustin Hoffman]] or [[Al Pacino]].{{sfn|Erickson, Hal|p=36|2017}} The feature caught the attention of producer [[Martin Elfand]].{{sfn|Parker, Jerry|1974|p=7}} Elfand took it to [[Martin Bregman]], who piqued the interest of [[Warner Bros.]] executive [[Richard Shepherd (producer)|Richard Shepherd]].{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=114}} Elfand hired Kluge and Moore to interview the people involved in the story. Before the script was written, Elfand wanted to ensure that he had signed releases by all the interviewees for the story rights. After the negotiation, each hostage received $600 ({{Inflation|US|600|1973|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}); one hostage asked for more money and was not included in the script.

Initially, Westenberg was offered $2,000, but he turned it down following the advice of his lawyer, because he was still serving a two-year sentence. After his release, he settled for $750.{{sfn|Parker, Jerry|1974|p=7}} Wojtowicz received $7,500 ({{Inflation|US|7,500|1973|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}) for the rights to the story. From the money, he earmarked $2,500 to Eden's reassignment surgery.{{sfn|UPI staff|1973|p=3}}

News outlets reported that Wojtowicz was granted one percent of the film's net profit;{{sfn|Jones, J.R.|2014}} Bregman later denied that his company, Artists Entertainment Complex, granted Wojtowicz a percentage of the gross. Bregman added he would give him $25,000 if the film performed as well as ''[[Serpico]]'' (1973) at the box office.{{sfn|Jahr, Cliff|1975|p=125}} Wojtowicz's lawyer Mark Landsman retained $3,500 of the payment he received.{{sfn|Jahr, Cliff|1975|p=125}} Meanwhile, Warner Bros. paid for Naturile's funeral.{{sfn|Washington Post-LA Times News Services|1974|p=72}} The working title of the film was ''The Boys in the Bank''.{{sfn|Alyson Publications staff|1990|p=32}} The budget was set at an estimate of $3.8&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|3.8|1973|r=2}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}).{{sfn|Gottlieb, Martin|1977|p=28}}

[[Frank Pierson]] was hired to write the screenplay. Aside from Kluge and Moore's research, Pierson conducted his own. He contacted journalist [[Randy Wicker]], who covered the story of the heist for gay publications, and provided technical assistance regarding Manhattan's gay nightclub scene.{{sfn|Washington Post-LA Times News Services| 1974|p=72}} Pierson decided that he wanted to center the story around Wojtowicz, who refused to receive Pierson in prison while he was in a financial dispute with Warner Bros.

Pierson analyzed the tapes of the interviews and news articles about the robbery, and approached those involved for additional information. Pierson could not define Wojtowicz's character because a different impression was left on each of the interviewees. The project overwhelmed him, but he could not quit because he had spent his cash in advance. Pierson reviewed his material and found that the unfulfilled promises Wojtowicz made was the common trait. Pierson viewed them as ""the story of the bank"", and the failure of the robbery.

Pierson finished the screenplay by Christmas 1973.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 3|2006}} Author [[Leslie Waller]] worked on a [[novelization]] of the Pierson script, released after the film, by [[Dell Publishing]].{{sfn|Copyright Office|1976|p=1784}}

=== Casting ===
With the finished script, Martin Bregman met with director Sidney Lumet and star Al Pacino in London.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 3|2006}} Pacino, who, at the time, was represented by Bregman, agreed to play the role.

Pacino backed out, and Dustin Hoffman expressed interest. Bregman did not meet with Hoffman; he felt that Pacino could bring the ""sensitivity"" and ""vulnerability"" needed for the role.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=114}} After more discussion, Pacino accepted the part but rejected it again. Bregman attributed it to Pacino's use of [[method acting]] and said that it ""might have been a world [Pacino] did not want to explore"". Bregman added that ""no major star had ever played a gay"".{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=115}}

But he wanted to make the film with Pacino. The actor backed out of the project a third time, and told Bregman that he wanted to return to the theater. He said that he would ""never make the adjustment necessary for the movies"".{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=115}} Pacino again returned to the project, and attributed his behavior to stress and drinking, and that he needed ""a life outside work"".{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=115}} Lumet mentioned the characterization of Sonny Wortzik's (Wojtowicz) ""insane framework of life"" as the stress factor for Pacino.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=115}} In a meeting before the rehearsals, Pacino asked Pierson and Lumet to tone down Sonny Wortzik's behavior; his request was rejected.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=115}} Eden described Wojtowicz as ""a very domineering person"",{{sfn|Washington Post-LA Times News Services|1974|p=72}} and added: ""he is good-natured&nbsp;... but sometimes went overboard&nbsp;... and he terrified me"".{{sfn|Bell, Arthur|1972|p=32}} Wicker later said that the screenplay of ''Dog Day Afternoon'' portrayed Wojtowicz to be ""more rational than he really was"".{{sfn|Getlen, Larry|2014}}

Much of the cast consisted of actors Pacino performed with in [[off-Broadway]] plays.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 2|2006}} Pacino asked Lumet to cast John Cazale as Sal Naturile,{{sfn|Schulman, Michael|2016|p=136}} whose was the only name that did not change for the film.{{sfn|Harris, Scott Jordan|2011|p=56}} Pacino had worked with Cazale on [[Israel Horovitz]]'s play ''[[The Indian Wants the Bronx]]'', and then in the 1972 film ''The Godfather''.{{sfn|Schoell, William|1995|p=18}}{{sfn|UPI staff 2|1972|p=24}} Lumet was not initially convinced he should cast Cazale. He was thirty-nine years old,{{sfn|Niemi, Robert|2006|p=404}} while Naturile was eighteen years old at the time of his death, but the director agreed after meeting him.{{sfn|Harris, Scott Jordan|2011|p=56}} [[Penelope Allen]] starred as Sylvia ""Mouth"" (based on Shirley ""Mouth"" Ball),{{sfn|Erickson, Hal|2017|p=36}} and had worked with Pacino before on ''[[Scarecrow (1973 film)|Scarecrow]]''.{{sfn|Schoell, William|2016|p=45}} For the role of Wortzik's mother, Pacino asked Lumet to cast [[Judith Malina]], co-founder of [[The Living Theatre]].{{sfn|Rapf, Joanna|2006|p=67}} Lumet wanted to portray the difference between a street police officer and one with an office job. [[Charles Durning]]{{sfn|Murphy, Mary|1975|p=11 (Part IV)}} and [[James Broderick]]{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 2|2006}} were cast as Moretti and Sheldon respectively, though Lumet initially decided on Durning being the bank manager and Broderick playing Moretti until Pacino intervened. Because Durning was also working on [[Robert Wise]]'s ''[[Two People (1973 film)|Two People]]'', Lumet and Wise had to coordinate his schedule, as he flew between California and New York.{{sfn|Lumet, Sidney|2005}} Lumet did not worry about Broderick's recasting because of his reputation for [[method acting]].{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 2|2006}} [[Sully Boyar]] was cast as bank manager Mulvaney (based on Robert Barrett).{{sfn|Erickson, Hal|2017|p=36}} [[Chris Sarandon]] convinced Lumet and Pacino during his reading and was cast as Leon Shermer. Lumet asked him to shift the focus of his characterization to ""a little less [[Blanche DuBois]], a little more Queens housewife"".{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 2|2006}}

There were three weeks of rehearsals,{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=117}} and the name of the project was changed to ''Dog Day Afternoon''. Pierson flew from Los Angeles to New York at Lumet's request. Pacino refused to kiss Sarandon in a scene as he thought it was ""exploitative""; he felt that the script kept ""pushing the gay issue"" on the audience.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 3|2006}} He expressed the view that viewers already knew the characters were homosexual and wanted to convey the failure of the relationship instead. Pierson agreed; he realized the couple did not actually kiss and that they had actually carried on a phone conversation. Pierson modified the scene to include the call.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 3|2006}} The [[National LGBTQ Task Force|National Gay Task Force]] approved of the script. Ronald Gold, then director of the organization, welcomed it as ""sensitive and tasteful"".{{sfn|Parker, Jerry|1974|p=7}}

==== Opening scene ====
Filming took place between September and November 1974.{{sfn|AFI staff|2020}} The opening montage shows New York's traffic, bridges, beaches, and neighborhoods before moving to a view of the Manhattan skyline from a cemetery.{{sfn|Schoell, William|2016|p=45}} Lumet wanted to convey ""a hot boring day, a [[Dog days|dog day]] afternoon"".{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 4|2006}} The director shot the footage from a station wagon, and ended in front of the bank, showing the robbers.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 4|2006}} The footage was silent, as Lumet decided that he did not want a score for the film.

418,Young Frankenstein,"==Plot==
{{Long plot|date=October 2024}}
Early in the 20th century, Dr. Frederick Frankenstein is a lecturing physician at an American medical school. He is engaged to Elizabeth, a socialite. Frederick actively distances himself from his grandfather [[Victor Frankenstein]], the infamous [[mad scientist]]. He even pronounces his surname as ""Fronkensteen"".{{sfnp|Picart|2003|p=46}} When Frederick inherits the family estate in [[Transylvania]], he travels to Europe to inspect the property. At the Transylvania train station, Frederick is met by a hunchbacked, bug-eyed servant named [[Igor (character)|Igor]], whose own grandfather worked for Victor. A young woman named Inga also greets him.

Arriving at the estate, Frederick meets Frau Blücher, the dour intimidating housekeeper. After discovering the secret entrance to Victor's laboratory and reading his private journals, Frederick resumes his grandfather's experiments in re-animating the dead.

Frederick and Igor steal a recently-executed criminal's corpse. He sends Igor to steal the brain of a deceased ""scientist and saint"" named [[Hans Delbrück]]. Igor accidentally destroys Delbrück's brain and takes another one labeled ""Abnormal"". Frederick unknowingly transplants it into the corpse and brings the [[Frankenstein's monster|Monster]] to life. It takes its first steps, but, frightened by Igor lighting a match, attacks Frederick and nearly strangles him before being sedated.

Unaware the Monster exists, the townspeople gather to discuss their unease at Frederick continuing his grandfather's work. Inspector Kemp, a one-eyed police inspector with a prosthetic arm and an unusually thick, barely-understandable German accent, proposes visiting the doctor, whereupon he demands assurance that Frederick will not create another Monster.

Returning to the lab, Frederick discovers Blücher releasing the creature. She reveals the Monster loves violin music and her own romantic relationship with Frederick's grandfather. The Monster becomes enraged by electrical sparks from a thrown switch and escapes the castle.

While roaming the countryside, the monster has encounters with a young girl and a blind hermit.{{efn|These encounters are references to 1931's ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' and 1935's ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', respectively.{{sfnp|Picart|2003|p=54}}}} Frederick recaptures the Monster and locks himself in a room with him. He calms the Monster's homicidal tendencies with flattery and a promise to guide him to success, embracing his heritage as a Frankenstein.

At a theater filled with prominent guests, Frederick shows ""The Creature"" following simple commands, then he and the Monster perform a musical number. A stage light explodes and frightens the Monster, interrupting the performance. The audience boo and throw vegetables at the Monster, who becomes enraged and charges at them. He is captured and chained by police. Back in the laboratory, Inga attempts to comfort Frederick; they have sex on the suspended reanimation table.

The Monster escapes from prison the same night Elizabeth arrives unexpectedly. The monster takes her captive as he flees. Elizabeth falls in love with the Monster due to his ""enormous Schwanzstucker"".{{sfnp|Hallenbeck|2009|p=108}} While the townspeople hunt the Monster, Frederick plays the violin to lure his creation back to the castle and recaptures him.

Just as the Kemp-led mob storms the laboratory, Frederick transfers some of his stabilizing intellect to the Monster who reasons with and placates the mob. Kemp then welcomes the Monster.

Sometime later, Frederick and Inga are wed, and Elizabeth marries the now-erudite and sophisticated Monster. While in bed with Frederick, Inga asks what he got in return during the transfer procedure. Frederick growls wordlessly like the monster and embraces Inga.",Comedy,,"director       = [[Mel Brooks]]

420,The Exorcist,"==Plot==
In northern Iraq, priest [[Lankester Merrin]] takes part in an archaeological dig in the ancient ruins of [[Hatra]]. During the dig, he finds a stone talisman of a winged being that evokes a concerned look on his face. He then has a vision in which a giant version of the same being appears nearby, silently confronting him.

In [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.]], actress Chris MacNeil is starring in a film directed by her friend Burke Dennings. MacNeil, along with her 12-year-old daughter [[Regan MacNeil|Regan]], rents a luxurious house with hired help. Meanwhile, Father [[Damien Karras]], a psychiatrist who counsels [[Georgetown University]] priests, visits his ailing mother in New York City. He later confides to a colleague that he is having a crisis of faith.

Chris hosts a party with Karras's friend, Father Dyer, who explains Karras's role as counselor and notes his mother's recent death. Regan, seemingly unwell, appears and urinates before Chris comforts her. Regan's bed shakes violently after Chris returns her to it. Later, Dyer consoles Karras, guilty at not having been with his mother when she died.

Regan's personality becomes violent. Medical tests find no physical cause. During a house call, Regan exhibits abnormal strength. One night, Chris finds the house empty except for a sleeping Regan; Dennings is found dead at the bottom of [[Exorcist steps|a set of public stairs]] that begin beneath Regan's window. Detective William Kinderman questions Karras, confiding that Dennings's head was turned backward. Regan's body becomes covered with sores. Kinderman tells Chris that the only plausible explanation for Dennings's death is that he was pushed from Regan's window. As Kinderman leaves, Regan has another violent fit, stabbing her vagina with a [[crucifix]] and turning her head backward. She is confined to her bedroom. Now convinced that her daughter is possessed, Chris seeks out Karras, who visits Regan. The possessed Regan claims to be [[Satan|the Devil]], and vomits into Karras's face while [[speaking in tongues]]. The demon says it will remain in Regan until she is dead. At night, Chris's assistant calls Karras to the house; he concludes that an exorcism is warranted. His superior grants permission on the condition that an experienced priest lead the ritual. Merrin, having performed an exorcism before, is summoned.

Merrin arrives at the house. As the two priests read from the [[Roman Ritual]], the demon curses them. The priests rest and Merrin, shaking, takes [[nitroglycerin]]. Karras enters the bedroom where the demon appears as his mother, perturbing Karras despite his denials. Merrin excuses Karras and continues the exorcism by himself. Karras assures Chris that Regan will not die and re-enters the room, finding Merrin dead from a heart attack while Regan watches and laughs. Karras beats the possessed Regan in a fit of rage and demands that the demon take him instead. The demon rips the medallion of Saint Joseph from Karras's neck and possesses him, freeing Regan in the process. Karras [[Autodefenestration|jumps out the window]], tumbling down the stone stairs outside. Chris and Kinderman enter the room. Chris embraces the healed Regan, and Kinderman surveys the scene. Outside, Dyer administers the dying Karras [[last rites]].

The MacNeils prepare to leave, and Father Dyer says goodbye. Despite having no memory of her ordeal, Regan, moved by the sight of Dyer's [[clerical collar]], kisses him on the cheek. As the MacNeils leave, Chris gives Dyer the medallion found in Regan's room. Dyer briefly examines the steps where Karras died before walking away.",Horror,"starring       = {{Plainlist|

In 1951, Sonny Crawford and Duane Jackson are high school seniors and friends in [[Anarene, Texas|Anarene]], an oil town in Texas. Duane is dating Jacy Farrow, the prettiest and richest girl in the small town. Sonny breaks up with his girlfriend Charlene Duggs. He is secretly in love with Jacy.

At a Christmas dance, Jacy is invited by Lester Marlow to a [[skinny-dipping]] party at the home of Bobby Sheen, a wealthy young man who seems to be a better prospect than Duane. At the same dance, Sonny kisses Ruth Popper, the depressed middle-aged wife of his high school coach. Jacy goes to the skinny-dipping party where Bobby makes an advance on her, but then says he will not have sex with girls who are still virgins.

Duane, Sonny and others take their young, mentally disabled friend, Billy, to a prostitute to lose his virginity. When the group takes Billy home, local businessman Sam ""The Lion"" is angered by the group’s treatment of Billy. Sam forbids the group from entering any of his businesses, the only entertainment sources of Anarene: the pool hall, the movie theater, and the café. Later, Sam notices that Sonny actually takes good care of Billy, who habitually sweeps the dusty Anarene main street with a broom. Sam accepts Sonny back into the cafeteria.

During the weekend of New Year's Eve, Duane and Sonny go on a road trip to Mexico. Before they drive off, Sam wistfully wishes he still had the stamina to join them and gives them some extra money so they can enjoy themselves. The boys return two days later, hung over and tired, and learn that Sam has died suddenly of a stroke. Sam’s will leaves the pool hall to Sonny.

Jacy invites Duane to a motel room to have sex, because she wants Bobby to accept her into his libertine circle, but Duane is unable to get an erection. She gets angry at Duane and berates him for being impotent. She later agrees to try again and goes with him to the same motel. Duane is able to perform, albeit very briefly, and just enough for Jacy to lose her virginity. She breaks up with Duane by telephone in anticipation of becoming Bobby's lover and girlfriend. However, Jacy learns that Bobby has already married another girl. Out of boredom and a sense of rejection, Jacy has sex with Abilene, a roughneck foreman who works for her father and is her mother's lover. Abilene drops Jacy off at her home and is brutally cold towards her. After entering the house, Jacy is caught by her mother Lois and starts crying. They both complain about the brutality of men.

Sad and angry because of the breakup, Duane enlists in the Army and is scheduled to serve in the [[Korean War]] after basic training. In Duane's absence, Jacy sets her sights on Sonny, who drops Ruth and starts dreaming of marrying Jacy. Duane returns home on leave, driving a brand-new [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]]. He fights with Sonny over Jacy, smashing a beer bottle into Sonny's eye. Sonny is hospitalized. During his recovery, he pretends to be asleep when Ruth visits him.

Jacy and Sonny elope and are married in [[Oklahoma]]. While driving to their honeymoon, Jacy reveals that she left a note to her parents explaining the entire plan. They are stopped by a state trooper who takes them to a police station where the Farrows await. Gene Farrow dismisses Sonny completely, taking Jacy home in his car. Sonny rides back with Lois and Lois reveals that Sam the Lion was her one true love when she was young. Lois tells Sonny that he would be much better off with Ruth than with Jacy. The marriage is annulled and a short time passes. 

On Duane's last night of leave, Sonny goes to Duane's house for a last chance of reconciliation. The two friends make amends and Sonny reveals that Jacy went to college in Dallas and never returned to Anarene. They go to the movies because the theater is going to close due to a lack of customers. The last picture show is ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]''.

The next morning, Sonny sees Duane off on the bus. Duane asks Sonny to take care of his Mercury after Sonny reveals that he and Jacy ""never made it to the motel."" Sonny opens the pool hall and hears a truck braking in the street nearby. The truck has killed Billy as he swept the road. Sonny approaches the local townsmen surrounding Billy's corpse; they blame the dead boy for being stupid and careless. Grief stricken, Sonny yells at the men for their behavior and carefully carries Billy's body to the top of a staircase, covering Billy’s face with his letterman jacket. 

Angry and depressed with his current life, Sonny drives to the city limits. He slowly changes his mind and drives back, parking his truck near Ruth's home. He goes to her door and shyly asks to come in for a cup of coffee. She looks depressed and has shuttered herself in her house. After letting him in, Ruth explodes in hurt and anger, breaking the coffee cup, she notices that Sonny is completely devastated. She demands that he look at her. He does and gently touches her hand. Still spent, she seems to forget her anger, takes pity on the boy, and starts to comfort him.","Drama, Romance","starring       = {{plainlist|

'''''The Last Picture Show''''' is a 1971 American [[Coming-of-age story|coming-of-age]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Peter Bogdanovich]] and co-written by Bogdanovich and [[Larry McMurtry]], adapted from the [[The Last Picture Show (novel)|1966 semi-autobiographical novel]] by McMurtry. The film's [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Timothy Bottoms]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Ellen Burstyn]], [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], [[Cloris Leachman]], and [[Cybill Shepherd]]. Set in a small town in northern [[Texas]] from November 1951 to October 1952, it is a story of two high school seniors and long-time friends, Sonny Crawford (Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Bridges).

''The Last Picture Show'' was theatrically released on October 22, 1971, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It was a critical and commercial success, grossing $29 million on a $1.3 million budget, and was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Johnson and Bridges, and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Burstyn and Leachman, with Johnson and Leachman winning.

Bogdanovich directed a 1990 sequel, ''[[Texasville]]'', based on McMurtry's 1987 [[Texasville (novel)|novel of the same name]] and featuring much of the original film's cast reprising their roles; ''Texasville'' failed to match the critical or commercial success of its predecessor. In 1998, the [[Library of Congress]] selected ''The Last Picture Show'' for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] for being ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"".<ref>{{cite web |title=Hooray for Hollywood (December 1998) - Library of Congress Information Bulletin |url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9812/film.html |website=www.loc.gov |access-date=2020-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress |access-date=2020-11-19}}</ref>

Jacy invites Duane to a motel room to have sex, because she wants Bobby to accept her into his libertine circle, but Duane is unable to get an erection. She gets angry at Duane and berates him for being impotent. She later agrees to try again and goes with him to the same motel. Duane is able to perform, albeit very briefly, and just enough for Jacy to lose her virginity. She breaks up with Duane by telephone in anticipation of becoming Bobby's lover and girlfriend. However, Jacy learns that Bobby has already married another girl. Out of boredom and a sense of rejection, Jacy has sex with Abilene, a roughneck foreman who works for her father and is her mother's lover. Abilene drops Jacy off at her home and is brutally cold towards her. After entering the house, Jacy is caught by her mother Lois and starts crying. They both complain about the brutality of men.

Sad and angry because of the breakup, Duane enlists in the Army and is scheduled to serve in the [[Korean War]] after basic training. In Duane's absence, Jacy sets her sights on Sonny, who drops Ruth and starts dreaming of marrying Jacy. Duane returns home on leave, driving a brand-new [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]]. He fights with Sonny over Jacy, smashing a beer bottle into Sonny's eye. Sonny is hospitalized. During his recovery, he pretends to be asleep when Ruth visits him.

Jacy and Sonny elope and are married in [[Oklahoma]]. While driving to their honeymoon, Jacy reveals that she left a note to her parents explaining the entire plan. They are stopped by a state trooper who takes them to a police station where the Farrows await. Gene Farrow dismisses Sonny completely, taking Jacy home in his car. Sonny rides back with Lois and Lois reveals that Sam the Lion was her one true love when she was young. Lois tells Sonny that he would be much better off with Ruth than with Jacy. The marriage is annulled and a short time passes. 

On Duane's last night of leave, Sonny goes to Duane's house for a last chance of reconciliation. The two friends make amends and Sonny reveals that Jacy went to college in Dallas and never returned to Anarene. They go to the movies because the theater is going to close due to a lack of customers. The last picture show is ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]''.

The next morning, Sonny sees Duane off on the bus. Duane asks Sonny to take care of his Mercury after Sonny reveals that he and Jacy ""never made it to the motel."" Sonny opens the pool hall and hears a truck braking in the street nearby. The truck has killed Billy as he swept the road. Sonny approaches the local townsmen surrounding Billy's corpse; they blame the dead boy for being stupid and careless. Grief stricken, Sonny yells at the men for their behavior and carefully carries Billy's body to the top of a staircase, covering Billy’s face with his letterman jacket. 

Angry and depressed with his current life, Sonny drives to the city limits. He slowly changes his mind and drives back, parking his truck near Ruth's home. He goes to her door and shyly asks to come in for a cup of coffee. She looks depressed and has shuttered herself in her house. After letting him in, Ruth explodes in hurt and anger, breaking the coffee cup, she notices that Sonny is completely devastated. She demands that he look at her. He does and gently touches her hand. Still spent, she seems to forget her anger, takes pity on the boy, and starts to comfort him.

==Production==
Going into ''The Last Picture Show'' Peter Bogdanovich was a 31-year-old stage actor, film essayist, and critic. Bogdanovich had directed one film, ''[[Targets]]'' (also known as ''Before I Die''), working with his wife and collaborator, [[Polly Platt]]. As Bogdanovich later explained to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', while waiting in a cashier's line in a drugstore, he happened to look at the rack of paperbacks and his eye fell on an interesting title, ''The Last Picture Show''. The back of the book said it was about ""kids growing up in Texas"" and Bogdanovich decided that it did not interest him and put it back. A few weeks later, actor [[Sal Mineo]] handed Platt a copy of the book.<ref name=""podcast"">{{Cite podcast|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJAIZD6jl0s |title= Peter Bogdanovich: 'The Last Picture Show' |website=It Happened in Hollywood |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date=January 25, 2020 |access-date=7 June 2023 }}</ref> ""I always wanted to be in this"", he said, ""but I'm a little too old now"", said Mineo, who recommended that Platt and Bogdanovich make it into a film.<ref name=""podcast""/> According to Bogdanovich, Platt said, ""I don't know how you make it into a picture, but it's a good book.""<ref name=""documentary"">Peter Bogdanovich (2001) ''The Last Picture Show: A Look Back'' [DVD]</ref> Bogdanovich, McMurtry, and Platt adapted the novel into the film of the same name.<ref name=""three"">Young, Neil (14 December 2002).

[[Stephen J. Friedman (producer)|Stephen Friedman]] was a lawyer with Columbia Pictures but keen to break into film production as he had bought the film rights to the book, so Bogdanovich hired him as producer.<ref name=""history"">{{Cite web |title=Stephen J. Friedman |url=http://www.kingsroadentertainment.net/history.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502041813/http://www.kingsroadentertainment.net/history.php |archive-date=2009-05-02 |website=Kings Road Entertainment}}</ref>

After discussing the proposed film with [[Orson Welles]], his houseguest at the time, Bogdanovich agreed with him that shooting the film in black and white would work aesthetically, which by then was an unusual choice.<ref name=""documentary""/>

The film was shot in Larry McMurtry's small hometown of [[Archer City, Texas|Archer City]] located in north-central Texas near the Oklahoma state line. McMurtry had renamed the town ''Thalia'' in his book; Bogdanovich dubbed it [[Anarene, Texas|Anarene]] (for a [[ghost town]] {{convert|8|mi|spell=in}} south of Archer City). The similarity to famed [[Cattle towns|cowtown]] [[Abilene, Kansas]], in [[Howard Hawks]]' ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948) was intentional.<ref name=""one"">{{cite web |last=Dirks |first=Tim |title=Filmsite Movie Review: ''The Last Picture Show'' |url=http://www.filmsite.org/lastp.html |publisher=Filmsite.org}}</ref> ''Red River'' again is tied in as ""the last picture show"", which Sonny and Duane watch at the end of the film.<ref>{{cite news |last=French |first=Philip |author-link=Philip French |title=Red River |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/27/red-river-hawks-philip-french |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=October 27, 2013 |access-date=January 29, 2021 |issn=0261-3077 |eissn=1756-3224}}</ref>

After shooting wrapped, Bogdanovich went back to Los Angeles to edit the film footage on a [[Moviola]]. Bogdanovich has said that he edited the entire film himself, but refused to credit himself as editor, reasoning that director and co-writer were enough.<ref name=""documentary""/> When informed that the [[Motion Picture Editors Guild]] required an editor credit, he suggested [[Donn Cambern]], who had been editing another film, ''[[Drive, He Said]]'' (1971), in the next office and had helped Bogdanovich with some purchasing paperwork concerning the film's opticals.<ref name=""documentary""/> Cambern disputes this, stating that Bogdanovich did do an edit of the film, which he screened for a selection of guests, including [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Bob Rafelson]] and himself.{{who|Who screened it for whom? The grammar is opaque.|date=December 2021}} The consensus was the film was going to be great, but needed further editing to achieve its full potential. Cambern claims Bogdanovich invited him to do so, during which he made significant contributions to the film's final form.

Bogdanovich obtained a rare waiver from the [[Directors Guild of America]] to have his name appear only at the end of the film, after the actors' credits, as he felt it was more meaningful for the audience to see their names after their performances.<ref>{{cite news |last=Young |first=Paul |title=Credit 'Kane' With Another Film Trend |newspaper=[[Daily Variety]] |date=January 4, 1994 |page=24}}</ref><ref>{{AFI film|54257}}</ref>{{who|Who's names - just Bogdonovich's or the entire casts'?

425,Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"==Plot==
[[File:Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) - Trailer.webm|thumb|Original release trailer of the film ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' (1969)]]
In 1899 [[Wyoming]], [[Butch Cassidy]] is the affable, clever, talkative leader of the outlaw [[Hole-in-the-Wall Gang]]. His closest companion is the laconic [[Sharpshooter|dead-shot]] ""[[Sundance Kid]]"". The two return to their hideout at [[Hole-in-the-Wall]] to discover that the rest of the gang, irked at Cassidy's long absences, have selected [[Harvey Logan]] as their new leader.

Logan challenges Cassidy to a [[knife fight]] over the gang's leadership. Cassidy defeats him using trickery, but embraces Logan's idea to rob a [[Union Pacific]] [[Overland Flyer|train]] on both its eastward and westward runs, agreeing that the second robbery would be unexpected and likely reap more money than the first.

The first robbery goes well. To celebrate, Cassidy visits a favorite [[brothel]] in a nearby town, where the town marshal unsuccessfully attempts to organize a [[Posse comitatus|posse]] to track down the gang, only to have his address to the townsfolk hijacked by a friendly bicycle salesman. Sundance, meanwhile, visits his lover, schoolteacher [[Etta Place]]. Cassidy joins up with them the next morning, and takes Place for a ride on his new bike.

On the second train robbery, Cassidy uses too much [[dynamite]] to blow open the [[safe]]. The explosion demolishes the baggage car in the process and the money flies everywhere. As the gang scrambles to gather it, a second train arrives carrying a six-man team of lawmen. The crack squad pursues Cassidy and Sundance, who try to hide out in the brothel, and then to seek [[amnesty]] from Sheriff Bledsoe, to no avail.

The posse remains in pursuit, and it includes renowned Indian [[tracking (hunting)|tracker]] ""Lord Baltimore"" and lawman [[Joe Lefors]], recognizable by his white [[boater|skimmer]]. Cassidy and Sundance elude their pursuers by jumping from a cliff into a river far below. They learn from Place that the posse has been paid by Union Pacific head [[E. H. Harriman]] to remain on their trail until they are both killed.

Cassidy convinces Sundance and Place that the three should go to [[Bolivia]], which he envisions as a robber's paradise. On their arrival there, Sundance is dismayed by the living conditions and regards the country with contempt, but Cassidy remains optimistic. However, they know too little [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to pull off a bank robbery, so Place attempts to teach them the language. With her as an accomplice, they become successful bank robbers known as {{lang|es|Los Bandidos Yanquis}}. However, their confidence drops after seeing a man wearing a white skimmer and fear that Harriman's posse is still after them.

Cassidy suggests ""going straight"", and he and Sundance land their first honest job as [[payroll]] guards for a mining company. However, they are ambushed by local [[Banditry|bandits]] on their first run and their boss, Percy Garris, is killed. They kill the bandits, the first time Cassidy has ever shot someone. The duo concludes the straight life is not for them. Sensing they will be killed should they return to robbery, Place decides to return to the United States.

Cassidy and Sundance steal a payroll and a burro used to carry it, and arrive in a small town. A boy recognizes the burro's [[livestock branding]] and alerts the police, leading to a gunfight with the outlaws. Cassidy has to make a desperate run to the burro to get ammunition, while Sundance provides covering fire. Wounded, the two take cover inside a building. Cassidy suggests their next destination should be [[Australia]]. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the two men, the local police have called on the [[Bolivian Army]]. The pair charge out of the building, guns blazing, into a hail of bullets from the massed troops who have occupied all the surrounding vantage points. The film ends with the sound of gunfire on a [[freeze-frame shot]] of the two bandits.","Biography, Crime, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|

428,The Graduate,"==Plot==
After earning his [[bachelor's degree]], Benjamin Braddock returns to his parents' home in [[Pasadena, California]]. During his graduation party, Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's law partner, asks him to drive her home. Once there, she tries to seduce him. At first he resists her advances but later changes his mind.
He invites Mrs. Robinson to the Taft Hotel, where he registers under the surname ""Gladstone"".

Benjamin spends the summer idly floating in his parents' swimming pool and meeting Mrs. Robinson at the hotel. During one of their trysts, Mrs. Robinson reveals that she and her husband married after she accidentally became pregnant with their daughter, Elaine. When Benjamin jokingly suggests that he date Elaine, Mrs. Robinson angrily forbids it.

His parents and Mr. Robinson relentlessly pester Benjamin to ask Elaine out. He reluctantly takes her on a date, to Mrs. Robinson's displeasure. Ben attempts to sabotage the date by ignoring Elaine, driving recklessly and taking her to a [[strip club]]. She flees the club in tears, but Benjamin chases after her, apologizes and kisses her. They eat at a [[drive-in]] restaurant, where they bond over their shared uncertainty about their future plans. After they visit the Taft Hotel for a late-night drink and the staff greet Benjamin as ""Mr. Gladstone"", Elaine deduces that Benjamin is having an affair. Benjamin admits to having an affair with a married woman whom he does not name. He tells Elaine the affair is over and asks to see her again.

To prevent Benjamin from dating Elaine, Mrs. Robinson threatens to tell her about their affair. To thwart this, Benjamin tells Elaine that the married woman is her mother. Elaine is so upset that she throws Benjamin out of the house and soon returns to school at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]. Benjamin follows her there, hoping to regain her affections. Elaine initially rejects him and briefly dates medical student Carl Smith. When she learns her mother lied about Benjamin raping her, she reconciles with him. Benjamin pushes for an early marriage, but Elaine is uncertain despite her feelings for him. Mr. Robinson arrives at Berkeley and angrily confronts Benjamin. He informs him that he and Mrs. Robinson are getting divorced and threatens to have him jailed if he keeps seeing Elaine. Mr. Robinson forces Elaine to leave college to marry Carl.

Benjamin drives to Pasadena and breaks into the Robinson home searching for Elaine. Instead he finds Mrs. Robinson, who tells him that he cannot prevent Elaine's marriage to Carl. Benjamin flees the house and drives back to Berkeley. There he discovers the wedding is in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] that very day. He speeds over 300 miles to Santa Barbara, but his car runs out of gas a short distance from the church. 

Benjamin runs to the church, arriving just as the ceremony is ending. His desperate appearance in the glass church gallery stirs Elaine into defying her mother and fleeing the sanctuary. Benjamin fights off Mr. Robinson and repels the wedding guests by swinging a large [[Christian cross|cross]], which he uses to barricade the church doors, trapping everyone inside. Benjamin and Elaine escape aboard a bus and sit among the startled passengers, with Elaine still in her wedding gown. As the bus drives on, their ecstatic smiles slowly change into neutral expressions as they begin to ponder their uncertain future together.","Comedy, Drama, Romance","starring       = {{Plainlist|

Guido Anselmi, a famous Italian film director, is suffering from ""[[Writer's block|director's block]]"". Stalled on his new [[science fiction film]] that includes [[Semi-autobiographical|thinly veiled autobiographical]] references, he has lost interest amidst artistic and marital difficulties. While attempting to recover from his anxieties at a luxurious spa, Guido hires a well-known critic to review his ideas for his film, but the critic blasts them. Guido has recurring visions of an Ideal Woman, whom he sees as key to his story. His mistress Carla comes to visit him, but Guido puts her in a separate hotel. The film production crew relocates to Guido's hotel in an unsuccessful attempt to get him to work on the film.

Guido admits to a cardinal that he is not happy. The cardinal offers little insight. Guido invites his estranged wife Luisa and her friends to join him. They dance, but Guido abandons her for his production crew. Guido confesses to his wife's best friend Rosella that he wanted to make a film that was pure and honest, but he is struggling with something honest to say. Carla surprises Guido, Luisa, and Rosella outside the hotel, and Guido claims that he and Carla ended their affair years earlier. Luisa and Rosella call him on the lie, and Guido slips into a fantasy world where he lords over a harem of women from his life, but a rejected showgirl starts a rebellion. The fantasy women attack Guido with harsh truths about himself and his sex life.

When Luisa sees how bitterly Guido represents her in the film, she declares that their marriage is over. Guido's Ideal Woman arrives in the form of an actress named Claudia. Guido explains that his film is about a burned-out man who finds salvation in this Ideal Woman. Claudia concludes that the protagonist is unsympathetic because he is incapable of love. Broken, Guido calls off the film, but the producer and the film's staff announce a press conference. Guido attempts to escape from the journalists and eventually imagines shooting himself in the head. Guido realizes he was attempting to solve his personal confusion by creating a film to help others, when instead he needs to accept his life for what it is. He asks Luisa for her assistance in doing so. Carla tells him that she figured out what he was trying to say: that Guido cannot do without the people in his life.

435,The Hustler,"==Plot==
""Fast Eddie"" Felson is accompanied by his partner, Charlie, at a pool room in a small town. Pretending to be salesmen on their way to a convention, Eddie and Charlie convince onlookers that Eddie is a drunk blowhard, and induce them to bet on Eddie to lose a trick shot. He wins and takes their money.

Eddie and Charlie arrive in Ames, Iowa,  where Eddie challenges the legendary player Minnesota Fats to play [[straight pool]] for $200 a game. After initially falling behind, Eddie surges back to being $1,000 ahead and suggests raising the bet to $1,000 a game. Eddie gets ahead $11,000 and Charlie tries to convince him to quit, but Eddie insists the game will end only when Fats says it is over. Fats agrees to continue after a spectator, the professional gambler Bert Gordon, labels Eddie a ""loser"". After 25&nbsp;hours and an entire bottle of bourbon, Eddie is ahead over $18,000, but loses it all along with all but $200 of his original stake. Fats declares the game over. At their hotel later, Eddie leaves a sleeping Charlie without saying goodbye.

Eddie stashes his belongings in a locker at a bus terminal, where he meets Sarah Packard, an alcoholic. They begin a relationship and he moves in with her. Charlie finds Eddie at Sarah's apartment and tries to persuade him to go back out on the road. Eddie refuses and Charlie realizes he plans to challenge Fats again. Eddie learns that Charlie had money he could have used to rebound and beat Fats. Eddie dismisses Charlie as a scared old man and tells him to ""lay down and die by yourself"".

Eddie joins a poker game where Bert is playing. Afterward, Bert tells Eddie that he has talent as a pool player but no character. He figures that Eddie will need at least $3,000 to challenge Fats again. Bert calls him a ""born loser"" but nevertheless offers to stake him in return for 75% of his winnings; Eddie refuses.

Eddie goes back to hustling to get the money he needs to play Fats. After hustling a local player at a pool room near the waterfront, Eddie is attacked after winning and his thumbs are broken. After Sarah helps Eddie convalesce, and when he’s ready to play, he agrees to Bert's terms, deciding that a ""25% slice of something big is better than a 100% slice of nothing"".

Bert, Eddie and Sarah travel to the [[Kentucky Derby]], where Bert arranges a match for Eddie against a wealthy local socialite named Findley. The game turns out to be [[three-cushion billiards]], not pool. When Eddie loses badly, Bert refuses to keep staking him. Sarah pleads with Eddie to leave with her, saying that the world he is living in and its inhabitants are ""perverted, twisted, and crippled""; he refuses. Seeing Eddie's anger, Bert agrees to let the match continue at $1,000 a game. Eddie comes back to win $12,000. He collects his $3,000 share and decides to walk back to the hotel where he discovers that Sarah has committed suicide, because of Bert's sadism.

Eddie returns to challenge Fats again, putting up his entire $3,000 stake on a single game. He wins game after game, beating Fats so badly that Fats is forced to quit. Bert demands half of Eddie's winnings and threatens to have him beaten unless he pays. Eddie says he will come back to kill Bert if he survives, shaming Bert into giving up his claim by invoking Sarah's memory. Instead, Bert orders Eddie never to walk into a big-time pool hall again.

===Prologue===
''1st Day Sequence'': A helicopter transports a statue of Christ over an ancient Roman [[Aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] outside Rome while a second, Marcello Rubini's news helicopter, follows it into the city. The news helicopter is momentarily sidetracked by a group of bikini-clad women sunbathing on the rooftop of a high-rise apartment building. Hovering above, Marcello uses gestures to elicit phone numbers from them but fails in his attempt. He then shrugs and continues following the statue to [[Saint Peter's Square]].

===Episode 1===
''1st Night Sequence'': Marcello meets Maddalena by chance in an exclusive nightclub. A beautiful and wealthy heiress, Maddalena is tired of Rome, while Marcello finds it suits him. They have sex in the bedroom of a prostitute whom they had given a ride home in Maddalena's Cadillac.

''1st Dawn Sequence'': Marcello returns to his apartment to find that his fiancée, Emma, has overdosed. On the way to the hospital, he declares his everlasting love to her and again as she lies in a semiconscious state in the emergency room. While waiting frantically for her recovery, however, he tries to make a phone call to Maddalena.

===Episode 2===
''2nd Day Sequence'': That day, he goes on assignment for the arrival of Sylvia, a famous Swedish-American actress, at [[Rome Ciampino Airport|Ciampino airport]] where she is met by a horde of news reporters.

During Sylvia's press conference, Marcello calls home to ensure Emma has taken her medication while reassuring her that he is not alone with Sylvia. After the film star confidently replies to the barrage of journalists' questions, her boyfriend Robert enters the room late and drunk.  Marcello casually recommends to Sylvia's producer that she be taken on a tour of St Peter's.

Inside St Peter's dome, a news reporter complains that Sylvia is ""an elevator"" because none of them can match her energetic climb up the numerous flights of stairs. Inspired, Marcello maneuvers forward to be alone with her when they finally reach the balcony overlooking [[St. Peter's Square]]. They almost share a kiss.

''2nd Night Sequence'': That evening, the infatuated Marcello dances with Sylvia in the [[Baths of Caracalla]]. Sylvia's natural sensuality triggers raucous partying while Robert, her bored fiancé, draws caricatures and reads a newspaper. His humiliating remark to her causes Sylvia to leave the group, eagerly followed by Marcello and his paparazzi colleagues. Finding themselves alone, Marcello and Sylvia spend the rest of the evening in the alleys of Rome, where they wade into the [[Trevi Fountain]].

''2nd Dawn Sequence'': Like a magic spell that has suddenly been broken, dawn arrives at the very moment Sylvia playfully ""anoints"" Marcello's head with fountain water. They drive back to Sylvia's hotel to find an enraged Robert waiting for her in his car. Robert slaps Sylvia, orders her to go to bed, and then assaults Marcello, who takes it in stride.

===Episode 3===
''3rd Day Sequence'': Marcello meets Steiner, his distinguished intellectual friend, inside a church. Steiner shows off his book of [[Sanskrit]] grammar. The two go up to play the organ, offering up a jazz piece for the watching priest before playing [[Bach]].

===Episode 4===
''3rd Day Sequence'': Late afternoon, Marcello, his photographer friend Paparazzo, and Emma drive to the outskirts of Rome to cover the story of the purported sighting of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Madonna]] by two children. Although the Catholic Church is officially skeptical, a huge crowd of devotees and reporters gathers at the site.

''3rd Night Sequence'': That night, the event is broadcast over Italian radio and television. Emma prays to the [[Virgin Mary]] to be given sole possession of Marcello's heart. Blindly following the two children from corner to corner in a downpour, the crowd tears a small tree apart for its branches and leaves said to have sheltered the Madonna.

''3rd Dawn Sequence'': The gathering ends at dawn with the crowd mourning a sick child, a pilgrim brought by his mother to be healed, but trampled to death in the melee.

===Episode 3b===
''4th Night Sequence'': One evening, Marcello and Emma attend a gathering at Steiner's luxurious home, where they are introduced to a group of intellectuals who recite poetry, strum the guitar, offer philosophical ideas, and listen to sounds of nature recorded on tape. The British poet [[Iris Tree]], whose poetry Marcello has read and admired, recommends that Marcello avoid the ""prisons"" of commitment: ""Stay free, available, like me.  Never get married.  Never choose.  Even in love, it's better to be chosen."" Emma appears enchanted with Steiner's home and children, telling Marcello that one day he will have a home like Steiner's, but he turns away moodily.

Outside on the terrace, Marcello confesses to Steiner his admiration for all he stands for, but Steiner admits he is torn between the security that a materialistic life affords and his longing for a more spiritual albeit insecure way of life. Steiner philosophizes about the need for love in the world and fears what his children may grow up to face one day.

===Intermezzo===
''5th Day Sequence'': Marcello spends the afternoon working on his novel at a seaside restaurant, where he meets Paola, a young waitress from Perugia playing [[Perez Prado]]'s cha-cha “[[Patricia (Perez Prado song)|Patricia]]” on the jukebox and then humming its tune. He asks her if she has a boyfriend, then describes her as an angel in Umbrian paintings.

===Episode 5===
''5th Night Sequence'': Marcello meets his father visiting Rome on the [[Via Veneto]]. With Paparazzo, they go to the ""Cha-Cha"" Club, where Marcello introduces his father to Fanny, a beautiful dancer and one of his past girlfriends (he had promised to get her picture in the paper but failed to do it). Fanny takes a liking to his father. Marcello tells Paparazzo that as a child he had never seen much of his father, who would spend weeks away from home. Fanny invites Marcello's father back to her flat, and two other dancers invite the two younger men to go with them.  Marcello leaves the others when they get to the dancers' neighborhood. Fanny comes out of her house, upset that Marcello's father has become ill.

''5th Dawn Sequence'': Marcello's father has suffered what seems to be a mild heart attack. Marcello wants him to stay with him in Rome so they can get to know each other, but his father, weakened, wants to go home and gets in a taxi to catch the first train to [[Cesena]]. He leaves Marcello forlorn, on the street, watching the taxi leave.

===Episode 6===
''6th Night Sequence'': Marcello, [[Nico]], and other friends meet on the Via Veneto and are driven to a castle owned by aristocrats at [[Bassano di Sutri]] outside Rome. There is already a party long in progress, and the party-goers are bleary-eyed and intoxicated. By chance, Marcello meets Maddalena again. The two of them explore a suite of ruins annexed to the castle. Maddalena seats Marcello in a vast room and then closets herself in another room connected by an [[echo chamber]]. As a disembodied voice, Maddalena asks him to marry her; Marcello professes his love for her, avoiding answering her proposal. Another man kisses and embraces Maddalena, who loses interest in Marcello. He rejoins the group, and eventually spends the night with Jane, a British artist and heiress.

''6th Dawn Sequence'': Burnt out and bleary-eyed, the group returns at dawn to the main section of the castle, to be met by the matriarch of the castle, who is on her way to mass, accompanied by priests in a procession.

===Episode 3c===
''7th Night Sequence'': Marcello and Emma are alone in his sports car on an isolated road. Emma continues an argument by professing her love and tries to get out of the car; Marcello pleads with her not to get out. Emma says that Marcello will never find another woman who loves him the way she does. Marcello becomes enraged, telling her that he cannot live with her smothering, maternal love. He now wants her to get out of the car, but she refuses.  With some violence (a bite from her and a slap from him), he throws her out of the car and drives off, leaving her alone on a deserted road at night.

''7th Dawn Sequence'': Emma hears Marcello's car returning as she holds wildflowers picked from the roadside. She gets into the car with neither of them saying a word.

Later, they are asleep in bed, tenderly intertwined, when Marcello receives a phone call. He rushes to the Steiners' apartment and learns that Steiner has killed his two children and himself. Marcello is interrogated by the police and afterwards volunteers to accompany an officer on his way to meet Steiner's wife. 

''8th Day Sequence'': After waiting at the bus stop, Marcello identifies Steiner's wife when she arrives. He and the officer escort her to the car to break the terrible news, while the paparazzi swarm around them snapping pictures.

===Episode 7===
''8th Night Sequence'': An unspecified amount of time later, an older Marcello—now with gray in his hair—has quit journalism and abandoned his attempt at writing a book to become a publicist. He and a group of partygoers break into a [[Fregene]] beach house owned by Riccardo, a friend of Marcello's. Many of the men are [[homosexual]]. To celebrate her recent divorce from Riccardo, Nadia performs a [[striptease]] to [[Perez Prado]]'s cha-cha “[[Patricia (Perez Prado song)|Patricia]]”. Riccardo shows up at the house and tells the partiers to leave. The drunken Marcello attempts to provoke the other partygoers into an orgy. However, their inebriation causes the party to descend into mayhem, with Marcello riding a young woman crawling on her hands and knees and throwing pillow feathers around the room.

===Epilogue===
''8th Dawn Sequence'': The party proceeds to the beach at dawn where they find a modern-day [[leviathan]], a bloated, sea ray-like creature, caught in the fishermen's nets.{{efn|The fish is not specified in the film script nor identified by critics or biographers. Set designer Piero Gherardi described his creation as ""a kind of huge beast with blobs of plaster all over it like veal tripe. For eyes I gave it convex enlarging lenses"".<ref>Alpert, 141. Cf. Kezich, 204-205 and Bondanella, 144</ref>}} In his stupor, Marcello comments on how its eyes stare even in death.

''9th Day Sequence'': Paola, the adolescent waitress from the seaside restaurant in Fregene, calls to Marcello from across an estuary, but the words they exchange are lost on the wind, drowned out by the crashing waves. He signals his inability to understand what she is saying or interpret her gestures. He shrugs and returns to the partygoers; one of the women joins him and they hold hands as they walk away from the beach. In a long final close-up, Paola waves to Marcello and then stands watching him with an enigmatic smile.","Comedy, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|

438,Anatomy of a Murder,"==Plot==
[[File:Anatomymurder trailer 2.jpg|left|thumb|Brooks West (left) and [[James Stewart]] (right) face one another, as [[George C. Scott]] (center) looks on]]
In the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]], small-town lawyer Paul Biegler, a former [[district attorney]] who lost his re-election bid, spends most of his time fishing, playing the piano, and hanging out with his [[alcoholic]] friend and colleague Parnell McCarthy and sardonic secretary Maida Rutledge.

One day, Biegler is contacted by Laura Manion to defend her husband, US Army Lieutenant Frederick ""Manny"" Manion, who has been arrested for the murder of innkeeper Bernard ""Barney"" Quill. Manion does not deny the murder, but claims that Quill raped his wife. Even with such a motivation, getting Manion cleared of murder would be difficult, but Manion claims to have no memory of the event, which suggests he may be eligible for a defense of [[irresistible impulse]]—a version of a [[Insanity defense#temporary insanity|temporary insanity]] defense. It is strongly implied that Manion is faking insanity, having been guided to it as a potential defense by Biegler. Biegler's folksy speech and laid-back demeanor hide a sharp legal mind and a propensity for courtroom theatrics that keeps the judge busy maintaining control. However, the case for the defense does not go well, especially as local district attorney Mitch Lodwick is assisted by high-powered prosecutor Claude Dancer from the Attorney General's office.

Furthermore, the prosecution tries at every instance to block any mention of Manion's motive for killing Quill. Biegler eventually manages to get the rape of Laura Manion into the record and Judge Weaver agrees to allow the matter to be part of the deliberations. During [[cross-examination]], Dancer insinuates that Laura openly flirted with other men, including the man she claimed raped her. Psychiatrists give conflicting testimony to Manion's state of mind at the time that he killed Quill. Dancer says that Manion may have suspected Laura of cheating on him because he asked her, a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], to swear on a [[rosary]] that Quill raped her. This raises doubt as to whether the act was consensual.

Quill's estate is to be inherited by Mary Pilant, whom Dancer accused of being Quill's mistress. McCarthy learns that Pilant is in fact Quill's daughter, a fact she is anxious to keep secret since she was born out of wedlock. Biegler, who is losing the case, tries to persuade Pilant that Al Paquette, the bartender who witnessed the murder, may know if Quill admitted to raping Laura but Paquette is covering this up, either because he loves Pilant or out of loyalty to Quill. Through Pilant, Biegler is unable to get Paquette to testify on behalf of Manion.

During the trial, Laura claims that Quill tore off her underwear while raping her; the underwear was not found where she alleged the rape took place. Pilant, previously unaware of any details of the case, hears this during the trial and then tells Biegler and later testifies that she found the panties in the inn's laundry room the morning after the alleged rape. Biegler suggests Quill may have attempted to avoid suspicion by dropping the panties down the [[Chute (gravity)#Building chute|laundry chute]] located next to his room. Dancer tries to establish that Pilant's answers are founded on her jealousy. When Dancer asserts forcibly that Quill was Pilant's lover and that Pilant lied to cover this fact, Pilant shocks everyone by stating that Quill was her father. Manion is found not guilty by reason of insanity. After the trial, Biegler decides to open a new practice, with a newly sober McCarthy as his partner.

The next day, Biegler and McCarthy travel to the Manions' [[trailer park]] home to get Manion's signature on a [[promissory note]] which they hope will suffice as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] for a desperately needed loan. It turns out the Manions have vacated the trailer park, the superintendent commenting that Laura Manion had been crying. Manion left a note for Biegler, indicating that his flight was ""an irresistible impulse"", the same justification Biegler used during the trial. Biegler states that Mary Pilant has retained him to execute Quill's estate; McCarthy says that working for her will be ""[[poetic justice]]"".","Crime, Drama, Mystery","starring       = [[James Stewart]]<br>[[Lee Remick]]<br>[[Ben Gazzara]]<br>[[Arthur O'Connell]]<br>[[Eve Arden]]<br>[[Kathryn Crosby|Kathryn Grant]]<br>[[Joseph N.

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->

Along the [[U.S.–Mexico border]], a [[time bomb]] placed inside a vehicle explodes, killing two people. Mexican special prosecutor Miguel Vargas, who is honeymooning in town with his new American wife Susie, takes an interest in the investigation, which is being conducted by veteran police captain Hank Quinlan and his devoted, admiring, fanatically loyal assistant, Pete Menzies. Quinlan is a recovering alcoholic and an anti-Mexican bigot. He lost a leg long ago, and now walks with a prosthetic ""game"" leg and a cane. He implicates Sanchez, a young Mexican man secretly married to the victim's daughter. During the interrogation at Sanchez's apartment, Menzies finds two sticks of [[dynamite]] in a shoe-box in the bathroom.  Vargas, who had accidentally knocked over the shoe-box a few minutes earlier and found it empty, accuses Quinlan of planting the dynamite, and begins to suspect that many of his previous convictions were similarly tainted. Quinlan angrily dismisses Vargas's allegation.

""Uncle"" Joe Grandi, the acting leader of a crime family Vargas has been investigating, makes common cause with Quinlan against Vargas, and plies Quinlan with liquor, causing him to break his sobriety. Grandi orders his family to capture and drug Susie with illegal recreational drugs; while she is unconscious, he and Quinlan lock her in a hotel room. Quinlan then murders Grandi and leaves the body there with Susie; however, drunk and exhausted, he carelessly also leaves his cane in the room with them. When Susie wakes up and sees the body, she screams for help, and gets arrested on suspicion of the murder, which infuriates Vargas. Searching the room, Menzies finds Quinlan's cane, and realizes that Quinlan is the real killer.

Vargas, reviewing Quinlan's past successes, confirms his suspicion that Quinlan has planted evidence in many of the cases. He confronts Menzies, who sadly agrees to work with him to expose Quinlan, by wearing a wire and getting a confession.

Quinlan hears an echo from Vargas' recording device, and realizes that Menzies is betraying him. He shoots and mortally wounds Menzies. He then aims his gun at Vargas, but the dying Menzies shoots Quinlan before he can fire. Susie is exonerated and reunited with Vargas. As Quinlan dies, it is revealed that Sanchez has confessed to the original bombing and that Quinlan's efforts had all been for nothing.","Crime, Drama, Film-Noir","starring       = {{Plainlist|

441,Sweet Smell of Success,"==Plot==
One night in Manhattan, slick, up-and-coming [[publicity|press agent]] Sidney Falco scans the ''New York Globe'' for the column of the immensely popular journalist J.J. Hunsecker, an influential media kingpin whose journalistic contributions and associated radio show both dominate the entertainment world. For the fifth consecutive day, J.J. has neglected to publicize any of Sidney's clients, as he is overly protective of his 19-year-old younger sister Susan and has asked Sidney to end her recent affair with Steve Dallas, a budding jazz guitarist.

Later, at the Elysian Room, where Steve performs with his group, the Chico Hamilton Quintet, Sidney argues with his uncle and Steve's manager, Frank D’Angelo, who has promised him that Steve and Susan will part. Upon learning from his girlfriend Rita, a [[cigarette girl]], that Susan is awaiting Steve behind the club, he interrupts the pair's celebration. Steve, who mainly values integrity, angrily accuses him of “scratching for information like a dog.” Inside, Rita appeals to Sidney to help her retain her job, which is at risk because she refused to sleep with J. J.’s main competitor, the prominent columnist Leo Bartha, who then ordered her dismissal. After Sidney secures a date with Rita, Susan questions his relationship with J.J. inside a cab, but he reassures her that J.J. is a close friend of his. Outside the [[21 Club]], J.J. greets his informer, Harry Kello, a corrupt police lieutenant, who is long indebted to J. J. for petitioning the mayor to save his job after Kello beat a suspect severely. When Sidney reveals Steve's and Susan's engagement, J.J. gives him an ultimatum to destroy their relationship. Desperate to salvage his career, he vows not to disappoint J.J.

Sidney attempts to blackmail Leo at [[Toots Shor's Restaurant|Toots Shor's Restaurant and Lounge]] by threatening to expose his marital infidelity with Rita unless Leo prints a defamatory gossip item stating that Steve is a Communist who smokes marijuana. Instead, Leo chooses exposure over compromising his journalistic integrity, which even his wife Loretta praises as his first decent act in years. Sidney then bribes another columnist, Otis Elwell, who agrees to print the item if Sidney will arrange for him to receive a sexual favor from an ""available"" woman. At his apartment, Rita balks at the implications of getting acquainted with Otis, but ultimately assents to Sidney's plan in order to stay employed. The next morning, the smear appears in Otis's column and the Chico Hamilton Quartet is fired.

As planned, J.J. theatrically gets Steve rehired with a phone call in front of Susan, but Steve rebukes him for being a malignant influence on society. Forced to choose between them, an overwhelmed Susan breaks up with Steve, hoping to save him from J.J.'s vengeance. Planning to destroy Steve's career, an incensed J.J. orders Sidney to plant marijuana on Steve; a shocked Sidney balks, saying he can accept a dog collar but not a noose, but once J. J. offers to let Sidney write his column for three months while he vacations with Susan in Europe, he acquiesces.

At the Elysian Room, Sidney slips the cigarettes into the pocket of Steve's coat. Once Steve finishes work that evening, Kello accosts him outside and so assaults him that he is hospitalized. At a bar, surrounded by his industry cohorts, Sidney celebrates his accomplishment but is then summoned to J.J.'s penthouse apartment. He arrives to find a distraught Susan in her nightgown, about to commit suicide by jumping off the balcony. He barely rescues her, and takes her into her bedroom to rest. Upon arriving to find the two holding each other, J.J. harshly scolds him. Realizing that Susan set him up, Sidney irately reveals to her that J.J. conspired to frame Steve; he then departs, vowing to reveal the truth and informing J.J. that Susan is permanently lost to him. J.J. then calls Kello and tells him Steve is innocent, ordering Sidney to be arrested for planting the evidence. As Sidney exits the building, Kello stops and brutally beats him.

As Susan packs her belongings, J.J. unsuccessfully begs her to stay; she coolly informs him that death is preferable to living with him. An overwrought J.J. watches from the balcony as she strides into the coming dawn to start life afresh with her lover.","Drama, Film-Noir","starring       = [[Burt Lancaster]] <br />[[Tony Curtis]] <br />[[Susan Harrison]] <br /> [[Martin Milner]] <br /> [[Sam Levene]] <br /> [[Barbara Nichols]] <br /> [[Jeff Donnell]] <br /> [[Chico Hamilton]] <br />

444,La Strada,"==Plot==
Gelsomina, an apparently somewhat simple-minded, dreamy young woman, learns that her sister Rosa has died after going on the road with the [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] Zampanò. Now the man has returned a year later to ask her mother if Gelsomina will take Rosa's place. The impoverished mother, with other mouths to feed, accepts 10,000 [[Italian lira|lire]], and her daughter tearfully departs the same day.

Zampanò makes his living as an itinerant street performer, entertaining crowds by breaking an iron chain bound tightly across his chest, then passing the hat for tips. In short order, Gelsomina's naïve and antic nature emerges, with Zampanò's brutish methods presenting a callous [[Foil (literature)|foil]]. He teaches her to play the [[snare drum]] and [[trumpet]], dance a bit, and clown for the audience. Despite her willingness to please, he intimidates her, forces himself upon her, and treats her cruelly at times. She develops a tenderness for him that is betrayed when he goes off with another woman one evening, leaving Gelsomina abandoned in the street. Yet here, as throughout the film, even in her wretchedness, she manages to find beauty and wonder, aided by some local children.

Finally, she rebels and leaves, making her way into town. There she watches the act of another street entertainer, Il Matto (""The Fool""), a talented [[Tightrope walking|high wire]] artist and clown. When Zampanò finds her there, he forcibly takes her back. They join a ragtag travelling circus where Il Matto already works. Il Matto teases the strongman at every opportunity, though he cannot explain what motivates him to do so. After Il Matto drenches Zampanò with a pail of water, Zampanò chases after his tormentor with his knife drawn. As a result, he is briefly jailed, and both men are fired from the travelling circus.

Before Zampanò's release from prison, Il Matto proposes to Gelsomina that there are alternatives to her servitude and imparts his philosophy that everything and everyone has a purpose – even a pebble, even she. A nun suggests that Gelsomina's purpose in life is comparable to her own. But when Gelsomina offers Zampanò marriage, he brushes her off.

On an empty stretch of road, Zampanò comes upon Il Matto fixing a flat tire. As Gelsomina watches in horror, the two men begin to fight; it ends after the strongman punches the clown on the head several times, causing the fool to hit his head on the corner of his car's roof. As Zampanò walks back to his motorcycle with a warning for the man to watch his mouth in the future, Il Matto complains that his watch is broken, then stumbles into a field, collapses, and dies. Zampanò hides the body and pushes the car off the road, where it bursts into flames.

The killing breaks Gelsomina's spirit and she becomes apathetic, constantly repeating, ""The Fool is hurt."" Zampanò makes a few small attempts to console her, but in vain. Fearful he will no longer be able to earn a living with Gelsomina, Zampanò abandons her while she sleeps, leaving her some clothes, money, and his trumpet.

Some years later, he overhears a woman singing the very tune Gelsomina often played. He learns that the woman's father had found Gelsomina on the beach and kindly taken her in. However, she had wasted away and died. Zampanò gets drunk, gets in a fight with the locals, and wanders to the beach, where he breaks down in tears.",Drama,"starring       = [[Giulietta Masina]]<br />[[Anthony Quinn]]<br />[[Richard Basehart]]

446,Stalag 17,"==Plot==
<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words.-->
In a German [[Stalag|prisoner-of-war camp]] named ''Stalag 17'', one of its compounds holds 630 American [[Aircrew|airmen]] (all of whom are [[sergeant]]s), and is overseen by camp warden [[Oberst]] von Scherbach. 

In December 1944, the men of Barracks 4—led by appointed barracks chief ""Hoffy"" Hoffman, and security officer Frank Price—arrange for the escape of fellow airmen Manfredi and Johnson. The pair are shot dead in the attempt, and the men believe they were betrayed by an [[informant]]. Suspicion falls on J. J. Sefton, an enterprising cynic who barters openly with the German guards for various luxuries. He also creates profitable ventures that distract from the mundanity of camp life: from organizing rat races for gambling, to an improvised [[distillery]] for brewing alcohol, to a makeshift telescope to spy on the Russian women from a neighboring compound. Clarence ""Cookie"" Cook, who narrates the story, serves as Sefton's naive and loyal aide. 

The men of Barracks 4 do their best to keep sane, which includes enduring the antics of barracks clowns ""Animal"" Kuzawa and Harry Shapiro, and listening for war news on a smuggled radio. Their jovial guard, [[Feldwebel]] Schulz, secretly retrieves hidden messages from a hollow black queen on the [[chess|chessboard]], and straightens the looped cord of a dangling light bulb, which serves as a signal between himself and the informant. Just before Christmas, a recently captured Lieutenant Dunbar is assigned to Barracks 4 until he can be sent to an officers camp. Sgt. Bagradian, who accompanies Dunbar, reveals that Dunbar rigged a time bomb in transit and blew up a munitions train. Sefton recognizes Dunbar from officers school, and believes that he only passed because of his rich family, creating tension between them. 

Schulz announces that an inspector from the [[Geneva Convention]] will arrive, and Sefton bribes the guards to let him spend the day with the Russian women. The radio is later confiscated by Schulz. Concluding that Sefton was rewarded for revealing the radio, the men confront him when he returns, but Sefton denies he was responsible. Von Scherbach interrupts to arrest Dunbar as a saboteur; the men blame Sefton again and brutally beat him. 

The next day, the inspector from Geneva arrives with [[Red Cross parcel]]s—including 2,000 [[Table tennis|ping-pong balls]], which the prisoners use to create [[smoke bomb]]s. The inspector is then told about Dunbar's removal, and he warns von Scherbach that Dunbar cannot be convicted without proof, lest there be [[war crime]] trials. Von Scherbach hands Schulz a black queen to be delivered to the informant. During the [[Christmas Eve]] celebrations, Price steathily switches out the black queen, reads the hidden message, and then resets the signal. Sefton, recovering from his beating, notices the signal afterwards and becomes suspicious. Price gets Bagradian to reveal the recipe of Dunbar's time bomb: a lit cigarette tucked into a matchbook. That night, an air raid siren forces the men to evacuate. Sefton hides and witnesses Price speaking German to Schulz, and demonstrating the time bomb as evidence against Dunbar. 

On Christmas Day, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] arrive to take Dunbar to [[Berlin]]. While Hoffy has Price guard Sefton (who is still believed to be the informant), he gathers the men to rescue Dunbar. A riot and an ignited smoke bomb distracts the guards, and Dunbar is taken to hide in a [[latrine]]'s [[water tower]] until nightfall. After von Scherbach threatens to raze the camp, the men of Barracks 4 decide that one of them must help Dunbar escape. Price volunteers, and Sefton finally accuses him of being a German spy. Sefton interrogates Price and reveals the messaging system he used; the men are convinced and Price tries to flee, but he is quickly restrained.

Anticipating a generous reward, Sefton decides to rescue Dunbar. He retrieves the Lieutenant, and the prisoners throw Price out of the barracks with cans tied to his leg. Price attracts the spotlights of every guard tower and is gunned down; Sefton and Dunbar escape amidst the chaos. The prisoners return to their bunks, and Cookie whistles ""[[When Johnny Comes Marching Home]]"".","Comedy, Drama, War","starring       = {{Plainlist|

After an especially hard day in Rome, her doctor gives her an injection and advises: ""Best thing I know is to do exactly what you wish for a while."" She secretly leaves the embassy to explore the city and, as the drug takes effect, falls asleep atop a low wall, where Joe Bradley, an American reporter, finds her. Not recognizing her, he thinks she is intoxicated and takes her to his apartment to sleep it off.

Joe oversleeps and misses the princess's press conference, but claims to his editor, Hennessy, that he attended. Hennessy shows him a news item about the cancellation of the press conference due to the princess's ""sudden illness"". Joe realizes the woman in his apartment is the princess from the newspaper photograph. Joe asks Hennessy what he would pay for an exclusive interview with her. Hennessy offers $5000, and counters with a $500 bet that Joe will not be able to get it.

Joe follows and sees her explore an outdoor market, buy shoes, and get her long hair cut short. Joe contrives to meet her on the [[Spanish Steps]] and convinces her to spend the day with him, taking her to a street café to meet up with Irving, who takes pictures with a camera concealed in his cigarette lighter. Ann claims to be playing truant from school. When Ann clumsily drives a [[Vespa]] through Roman traffic with Joe as a passenger, they are arrested, but Joe and Irving show their ""fake"" press passes and are released. They tour the [[Colosseum]]. Joe then takes Ann to the [[Bocca della Verità|Mouth of Truth]] and tells her the legend attached to it: if a liar puts their hand in the mouth, it will be bitten off. After Ann tries it, when it is Joe's turn, he startles her by pretending that his hand was cut off.

At a dance on a boat, agents from Ann's government try to forcibly take her back. Ann joins Joe and Irving in the fight that breaks out. When Joe is knocked into the river, Ann jumps in after him. They swim away and kiss as they sit shivering on the riverbank. While drying their wet clothes at Joe's apartment, a radio bulletin says that the people of Ann's country are concerned that her illness may be serious. Ann asks Joe to drive her to a corner near the embassy, where they kiss again. She bids him a tearful farewell.

Upon her return, the princess replies to those attempting to remind her of her duty, ""Were I not completely aware of my duty to my family and my country, I would not have come home tonight...or indeed ever again.""

Joe tells a disbelieving Hennessy that he did not get the story, although he tells Irving he cannot stop him from selling the photographs. Joe and Irving attend the rescheduled press conference, to Ann's surprise. She asserts her faith in relations between nations just as between people, and Joe assures her that her faith is not misplaced. When asked which city she most enjoyed visiting, she begins to say it would be difficult before declaring ""Rome. By all means, Rome."" Other photographers take pictures with their large press cameras, while Irving makes a show of using his cigarette lighter.

449,In a Lonely Place,"==Plot==
[[File:In a Lonely Place - trailer - 07.png|thumb|left|Bogart as Dixon Steele]]

Dixon ""Dix"" Steele is a down-on-his-luck [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] [[screenwriter]] who has not had a successful movie since before [[World War II]]. While driving to meet his agent, Mel Lippman, Dix's explosive temper is revealed when, at a stoplight, he engages with another motorist in a confrontation that almost becomes violent. Meeting with Mel at a nightclub, Dix is cajoled into adapting a book for a movie. The hat-check girl, Mildred Atkinson, is engrossed in reading the copy meant for Dix; since she only has a few pages left to go, she asks to be allowed to finish it. Dix claims to be too tired to read the novel, so he asks Mildred to go home with him to explain the plot. As they enter the courtyard of his apartment, they pass a new tenant, Laurel Gray. Mildred describes the story, confirming what Dix had suspected—the book is no good. Rather than drive her home as promised, he gives her cab fare instead.

The next morning, Dix is awakened by his friend, police detective Brub Nicolai, who served under Dix during the war. Nicolai takes him downtown to be questioned by his superior, Captain Lochner, who reveals that Mildred was murdered and informs Dix that he is a suspect. Dix remembers that Laurel saw him letting Mildred out of his apartment, which Laurel confirms when brought in for questioning. Afterwards Dix strikes up conversation with Laurel and their mutual attraction is evident. When he gets home, Dix checks up on Laurel. He finds she is an aspiring actress with only a few low-budget films to her credit. They begin to fall in love and, with Laurel assisting him, Dix enthusiastically goes back to work, much to Mel's delight.

[[File:LonelyPlaceTrailer.jpg|thumb|Laurel takes a frightening ride with Dix]]

At a dinner with Nicolai and his wife, Sylvia, Dix has them re-enact the murder as he imagines it; his odd behavior leads Sylvia to doubt his innocence. Captain Lochner meets with Laurel again and sows seeds of doubt in her mind, as he has fixated on Dix's record of violent behavior. Laurel confides in Sylvia her growing doubts about Dix.

At a nightclub with Laurel, Dix spots Ted Barton, another detective, arriving with a female companion. Dix angrily leaves, believing that Barton is tailing him. Later, Laurel's masseuse Martha warns her about Dix's chequered romantic past, and Laurel grows irritated, kicking her out of the apartment. At a beach party with the Nicolais, Sylvia inadvertently reveals Laurel's follow-up meeting with Lochner; Dix furiously storms off. Laurel follows and gets into Dix's car; he drives erratically and at speed until they sideswipe another car. Nobody is hurt, but when the other driver accosts him, Dix beats him unconscious and is about to strike him with a large rock when Laurel stops him.

Dix goes to the police station and attempts to clear his name, inadvertently meeting Mildred's boyfriend Henry Kesler, who works at a bank. Dix remarks to Nicolai that Kesler is a better suspect as he has a motive. At the Nicolai residence, Laurel asks Sylvia about Dix prompting the Nicolais to re-enact the murder, and tells her about Dix's roadside assault.

Eventually, Laurel's doubts about Dix's innocence result in her being unable to sleep without taking pills. When he asks her to marry him, she accepts, but only because she is scared of how he might react if she refuses. Mel comes over to celebrate while Dix is away, only to find out that Laurel does not want to go through with the marriage and is making plans to escape to New York. She urges Mel to bring Dix's completed script to a producer.

At a dinner to celebrate the engagement, Dix is annoyed to learn that Mel has submitted his script without his consent. Dix then intercepts a telephone call meant for Laurel at the table, angrily discovering it is Martha and slugging Mel when he tries to intervene.

Back at Laurel's apartment, Dix flies into a rage when he sees that she has removed her engagement ring. After briefly calming down, Dix answers the phone, learning of Laurel's intended flight to New York. He again becomes violent, almost strangling Laurel before regaining control of himself when the phone rings again. It is Nicolai, who informs Dix and Laurel that Kesler has confessed to Mildred's murder, with Lochner apologizing for fixating on Dix. However, both Dix and Laurel realise that it is too late to salvage their relationship. Laurel watches in tears as Dix slowly walks away across the courtyard to his apartment.","Drama, Film-Noir, Mystery","starring       = {{ubl|[[Humphrey Bogart]]|[[Gloria Grahame]]|[[Frank Lovejoy]]|[[Carl Benton Reid]]|[[Art Smith (actor)|Art Smith]]|[[Jeff Donnell]]|[[Martha Stewart (actor)|Martha Stewart]]}}

In [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] [[England]], Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini, 10th Duke of Chalfont, is in prison, awaiting his [[hanging]] for murder the following morning. As he writes his memoirs, a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] ensues.

His mother, the youngest daughter of the 7th Duke of Chalfont, eloped with an Italian opera singer named Mazzini and was disowned by her family for marrying beneath her station. The Mazzinis were poor but happy until Mazzini died shortly after Louis was born. Louis's mother raises him on the history of her family and tells him how, unlike most other [[peerage]]s, the dukedom of Chalfont can descend through female heirs. Louis's only childhood friends are Sibella and her brother, the children of a local doctor.

When Louis leaves school, his mother writes to her kinsman Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, a [[private bank]]er, for assistance in launching her son in a career, but is rebuffed. Louis is forced to work as an assistant in a [[draper]]'s shop. When his mother dies, her last request, to be interred in the family [[Burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]] at Chalfont Castle, is denied. Louis proposes marriage to Sibella, but she ridicules his proposal, and marries Lionel Holland, a former school friend of her brother who has a rich father. Soon after this, Louis quarrels with a customer, Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, the banker's only child, who has him dismissed from his job.

Louis resolves to kill Ascoyne D'Ascoyne and the other seven people ahead of him in the [[order of succession]] to the dukedom. After arranging a fatal boating accident for Ascoyne D'Ascoyne and his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], Louis writes a letter of condolence to his victim's father, Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, who employs him as a clerk. Upon his later promotion, Louis takes a [[bachelor pad|bachelor flat]] in [[St James's]], London, for assignations with Sibella.

Louis next targets Henry D'Ascoyne, a keen amateur photographer. He meets Henry and is charmed by his wife, Edith. He substitutes [[petrol]] for [[Kerosene|paraffin]] in the lamp of Henry's [[darkroom]], with fatal results. Louis decides the widow is fit to be his duchess. The Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne is the next victim. Posing as the Bishop of [[Matabeleland]], Louis poisons Lord Henry's after-dinner [[port (wine)|port]]. From the window of his flat, Louis then uses a bow and arrow to shoot down the [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloon]] from which the [[suffragette]] Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne is dropping leaflets over London. Louis next sends General Lord Rufus D'Ascoyne a jar of [[caviar]] which contains a bomb. Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne presents a challenge, as he rarely sets foot on land. However, by chance he conveniently insists on [[The captain goes down with the ship|going down with his ship]] after causing a collision at sea.

When Edith agrees to marry Louis, they notify Ethelred, the childless, widowed eighth duke. He invites them to spend a few days at Chalfont Castle. When Ethelred casually informs Louis that he intends to remarry in order to produce an heir, Louis arranges a hunting ""accident"". Before shooting the duke, he reveals his motive. Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne dies from the shock of learning that he has become the ninth duke, sparing Louis from having to murder his kindly employer. Louis inherits the dukedom, but his triumph proves short-lived.

Sibella's husband, Lionel, had made a drunken plea to Louis for financial help to avoid bankruptcy, but Louis turned him down flat. Lionel is later found dead, and a [[Scotland Yard]] detective arrests Louis on suspicion of murder. Louis elects to be [[Privilege of peerage#Trial by peers|tried by his peers]] in the [[House of Lords]].{{refn|At the time of the film's release, this privilege had just been abolished by the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]], after it had been claimed in 1935 by [[Edward Russell, 26th Baron de Clifford|Lord de Clifford]].|group=n}}  During the trial, Louis and Edith are married. Sibella falsely testifies that Lionel was about to seek a divorce and name Louis as [[co-respondent]]. Ironically, Louis is convicted of a murder he had never even contemplated.

Louis is visited by Sibella, who observes that the discovery of Lionel's [[suicide note]] and Edith's death would free Louis and enable them to marry, a proposal to which he agrees. Moments before his hanging, the discovery of the note secures his release. Louis finds both Edith and Sibella waiting for him outside the prison, but is undecided which to choose. When a reporter tells him that ''[[Tit-Bits]]'' magazine wishes to publish his memoirs, Louis suddenly remembers that he has left them behind in his cell (thereby providing the authorities with a complete [[Confession (law)|confession]]).","Comedy, Crime","starring       = {{plainlist|

452,Out of the Past,"==Plot==
Joe Stefanos arrives in [[Bridgeport, California]], a rural mountain town, seeking Jeff Bailey, who owns a local gas station. Joe meets The Kid, Jeff's deaf-mute employee and friend, and asks him about Jeff's whereabouts. Meanwhile, Jeff is fishing with Ann Miller and they are in love. (Her lifelong friend Jim is jealous.) The Kid shows up at the fishing spot and interrupts them, [[American Sign Language|signing]] to Jeff that someone is asking about him. Jeff returns to the gas station and Stefanos tells Jeff that he must go to [[Lake Tahoe]] to meet ""Whit"" and that it has been a long time since they met.

Jeff invites Ann to ride with him to Whit's place. He tells her about his past in a flashback that took place three years ago. Jeff Bailey's real name is Jeff Markham. He and Jack Fisher were partners and [[private investigator]]s in New York. Whit Sterling, a gambling kingpin, hires Markham—solo—to find Whit's girlfriend, Kathie Moffat, who shot Whit and stole $40,000 from him. Whit promises Jeff she will not be harmed if he finds her and has her returned to him.

Jeff eventually corners Kathie in [[Acapulco]]. He is immediately taken by her beauty. She admits she shot Whit and that she hates him, but denies taking his money. Eventually, Jeff falls in love with her and proposes that they run away together. Suddenly, Whit and Stefanos show up at Jeff's place in Acapulco. They ask Jeff if he managed to find Kathie but he lies to them and says that Kathie is on a south-bound steamer. Whit instructs Jeff to keep looking for her.

Jeff and Kathie then secretly run to [[San Francisco]]. At first they avoid appearing in public spaces, but then feel more comfortable to go out as time moves on. However, Jack Fisher, who is now working for Whit, spots Jeff at the track. Jeff arranges to meet Kathie to split and then meet at a mountain cabin to lose Fisher from trailing him, but Fisher chooses to follow Kathie instead and catches them at the cabin. Fisher tries to blackmail them and the two men brawl. Kathie deliberately kills Fisher and drives away, leaving behind a bank book showing a balance of $40,000. She had in fact taken Whit's money.

[[File:Out of The Past 1947.JPG|thumb|right|Mitchum and Greer]]

The flashback ends. Jeff wants to clean things up and return to Ann. Ann drops him off at Whit's estate. A cheerful Whit tells Jeff he has a job for him. To his surprise, Jeff finds out that Kathie went back to Whit and she appears as the two men have breakfast. She later comes to speak privately with Jeff and she tells him that she had no choice but to come back. She told Whit about their relationship but not about what happened to Fisher. He tells her to get out.

[[File:OutOfThePastMitchumGreer.jpg|left|thumb|Mitchum and Greer]]

Leonard Eels, a crooked San Francisco lawyer, helped Whit dodge $1 million in taxes and is now [[blackmail]]ing him. Whit wants Jeff to recover the incriminating records and tells him to meet with Eels's secretary. The secretary, Meta Carson, explains the plan to Jeff, who suspects he is being framed. That night, at Eels's apartment, Jeff alerts Eels, obliquely, promising to return. After Jeff and Meta leave Eels's apartment, Jeff trails Meta, then returns and finds Eels dead. He decides to hide the body in the closet.

Jeff then sneaks into Meta's apartment, and overhears Kathie arranging for the discovery of Eels's body. When the hidden body is not found, she believes Eels has escaped. Jeff confronts her, and Kathie reveals that she gave Whit a signed [[affidavit]] swearing that Jeff killed Fisher. She says they can start all over again. They kiss, he leaves. Stefanos arrives and confirms to Kathie that he killed Eels.

Jeff consigns the tax papers to a delivery service. Whit's thugs capture him. He offers the incriminating records in exchange for the affidavit, without implicating Kathie. When Kathie and Meta arrive at Eels's apartment to retrieve the affidavit, the police are already there. The women instead phone Whit.

Jeff becomes wanted for the murders of Fisher and Eels, and police expect him to return to Bridgeport. Stefanos, directed by Kathie, trails the Kid to the gorge where Jeff is hiding out. The Kid spots Stefanos poised to shoot Jeff and hooks his coat with a fishing line, pulling him off-balance so that he falls to his death. Jeff returns to Whit's mansion to inform them of Stefanos's death and to tell Whit about Kathie's double-cross. He suggests making Stefanos's death look like a guilt-ridden suicide after his murder of Eels. He will return the records if Whit destroys Kathie's affidavit and hands her over to the police for Fisher's death. Whit accepts, promising Kathie he will kill her if she does not cooperate.

Jeff meets Ann in the woods. She believes in him, but tells him to be absolutely sure of what he wants. She will wait.

Jeff discovers that Kathie has killed Whit. She gives Jeff a choice: run away with her or take the blame for all three murders. He dials the phone while she is upstairs packing. They leave in a car with Jeff driving. Seeing a police [[roadblock]] ahead, Kathie shoots him. She fires at the police. A [[machine gun]] riddles the car with bullets, killing her.

In Bridgeport, Ann asks the Kid if Jeff was going away with Kathie. Lying, the Kid nods his head. Ann gets into Jim's car, and the Kid smiles, saluting Jeff's name on the gas station's sign.","Crime, Drama, Film-Noir","starring       = {{ubl|[[Robert Mitchum]]|[[Jane Greer]]|[[Kirk Douglas]]|[[Rhonda Fleming]]}}

453,Brief Encounter,"== Plot ==
In a railway station [[Railway refreshment room|refreshment room]], a man and a woman are sitting glumly at a table when one of the woman's friends comes in and immediately begins chatting away. After some terse pleasantries, the man leaves to catch his train. The man's companion explains that the man is about to move to Africa. After the man leaves, the companion briefly disappears without warning but returns, explaining that she wanted to see the express train. After a short interval, the two women head for their own train.

At home, Laura Jesson, the woman at the table, sits in the living room with her husband Fred. Although Fred is a kind man, he lacks Laura's ear for music and seems more interested in filling out the crossword than conversing with his wife. Laura silently reflects on her recent experiences, which she retells in the form of a confession to her husband.

Like many women of her social standing at the time, Laura visits a nearby town every week to shop and watch a matinée film. During one such outing to [[Milford, Surrey|Milford]], while waiting in the railway station's refreshment room, she is assisted by a fellow passenger, Alec Harvey, who removes a piece of grit from her eye. Alec is an idealistic [[general practitioner]] who also works as a consultant at the local hospital on Thursdays. Both Laura and Alec are married with children, although Alec's wife Madeleine and their two sons are never seen.

The two encounter each other again by chance the following week outside [[Boots (company)|Boots the Chemist]], and during a third meeting, they share a table at lunch. With time to spare, they attend an afternoon performance at the Palladium Cinema. They soon become uneasy as their innocent, casual relationship begins to deepen, verging on infidelity. They eventually admit they love each other.[[File:BriefEncounter-TrainWindow.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Laura ([[Celia Johnson]]) and Alec ([[Trevor Howard]]) say their penultimate goodbyes at the train station. Alec asks Laura to forgive him: ""For meeting you, in the first place. For taking the piece of grit out of your eye. For loving you. For bringing you so much misery."" Laura replies, ""I'll forgive you if you'll forgive me.""]]Laura and Alec continue meeting in public until they unexpectedly run into some of Laura's friends, necessitating the first of many deceptions. Eventually, they agree to make love at the flat of Alec's friend Stephen, who has dinner plans. However, Stephen returns unexpectedly. Stephen overhears Laura sneaking out and subtly chides Alec for his infidelity. A distraught Laura wanders the streets for three hours until a concerned police officer urges her to go home.

Alec surprises Laura at the train station. They admit to each other that it is impossible for them to maintain their relationship. Alec reveals that he has been offered a job in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], where his brother lives. Although he was initially unsure whether to take it, he decides he must leave England to put a definitive end to his affair with Laura, and to avoid hurting their families. He offers to leave the decision to Laura, but Laura replies, ""That's unkind of you, my darling.""

The next week, Laura and Alec have their final meeting in the railway station refreshment room, now seen with the poignant perspective of their shared history. As they prepare to part for the last time, Dolly Messiter, an acquaintance of Laura's, interrupts them, oblivious to their anguish.

Alec’s train arrives before they can say a proper goodbye. He discreetly squeezes Laura’s shoulder as he departs, leaving her with Dolly. Laura, overcome with emotion, nearly commits suicide by jumping in front of an express train. However, she gathers herself and returns home to her family.

At home, Laura is nearly overcome with emotion. Fred senses her turmoil and acknowledges Laura's emotional distance, though whether he understands the cause remains unclear. He thanks her for coming back to him, and she weeps in his arms.

A parallel subplot involves the interactions of the station and refreshment room staff. Two of the staff flirt with each other but cannot engage in public displays of affection during work hours, which humorously contrasts with Laura and Alec's ability to meet openly with each other and inability to have a relationship outside of work hours.","Drama, Romance","starring       = {{Plainlist|

455,The Best Years of Our Lives,"==Plot==
Three returning [[World War II]] veterans meet on a flight to their [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] hometown of Boone City: [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[Bombardier (aircrew)|bombardier]] [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] Fred Derry, [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[petty officer#United States|petty officer]] Homer Parrish, and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Sergeant#United States|sergeant]] Al Stephenson. Each had left a very different life behind:

Fred Derry was a drug store [[soda jerk]] who lived with his parents on the wrong side of the tracks. Before shipping out, Fred married a gold-digger named Marie after a whirlwind romance. Marie has since been working in a nightclub to fill her time (and her nightlife) in spite of Fred's generous combat pay as an Air Force officer.

Al Stephenson was an executive at a bank and lived in a luxury apartment with his wife, Milly, and their teenage children, Peggy and Rob.

Homer Parrish was a star high school athlete living with his middle-class parents and younger sister. Homer had also been dating his next-door neighbor Wilma, whom he intended to marry upon his return from the war.

Each man faces challenges integrating back into civilian life. Homer lost both hands in the war and though he has become functional in the use of his [[prosthesis#Hooks|mechanical hooks]], he cannot believe that Wilma will still want to marry him. Al, tired and jaded from the war, returns to the bank and is given a promotion, but wrestles with alcohol. Though highly decorated, Fred suffers from [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] by night.

Fred arrives home and cannot locate his party girl wife, who does not expect him. The Stephensons and their daughter Peggy invite Fred along with them for the evening, bar hopping in celebration of Al's return. An inebriated Fred keeps asking Peggy who she is, and she keeps reminding him that she is ""Al's daughter.""

Although proficient in managing the challenges of his disability, Homer is frustrated by his loss of independence and adjusting to his relationship with Wilma. Concerned that Wilma does not fully understand the difficulties of being married to him with his disabilities, Homer demonstrates to her how she will need to assist him at bedtime when he removes his harness with his prosthetic hands, leaving him helpless. Wilma believes she can commit herself to him for life.

Al continues to struggle with re-entry into normal life. Widely respected by the bank's senior management for his past business acumen, Al is criticized after approving an unsecured loan to a farmer and fellow veteran who wants it to buy forty acres, but has no collateral for the purchase. With inhibitions lowered by [[Binge drinking|excessive drinking]], Al gives a speech at a banquet that satirizes requiring a veteran to provide collateral before risking his life to take a hill in battle.

Unable to find a better job than soda jerk, Fred returns to the same drug store. Fred and Peggy develop an attraction for each other, which puts the married Fred at odds with Al. When Homer visits Fred at the drug store, another customer criticizes US involvement in the war, telling Homer his injuries were unnecessary. Homer responds angrily, and Fred intervenes on his behalf, punching the customer and consequently being fired. Meanwhile, Marie, frustrated with his lack of financial success and missing her past nightlife, decides to get a divorce. Bitter, and seeing no future in Boone City, particularly with Al telling Fred to stay away from Peggy, Fred decides to catch the next plane out. While waiting at the airport, Fred walks into an [[aircraft boneyard]], climbing into a decommissioned [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] bomber. Sitting in the bombardier's seat, Fred has another flashback. He is roused out of his stressful memories by a work crew foreman, who reveals that the planes are being demolished for use in the growing prefab housing industry. Fred asks if they need any help in the budding business and is hired.

Al, Milly, and Peggy attend Homer and Wilma's wedding, where Fred is best man. Now divorced, Fred reunites with Peggy after the ceremony. Fred expresses his love but says things may be financially difficult if she stays with him. Peggy's smile expresses her joy.","Drama, Romance, War","starring       = {{Plainlist|

[[File:The Wizard of Oz Judy Garland Terry 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|[[Judy Garland]] as Dorothy Gale and [[Terry (dog)|Terry]] as [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]]]]
<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots are between 400 and 700 words.-->
In rural [[Kansas]], [[Dorothy Gale]] lives on a farm owned by her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em. Dorothy's neighbor, Almira Gulch, who had been bitten by Dorothy's dog, Toto, obtains a sheriff's order authorizing her to seize Toto. Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy, who runs away to protect him. Professor Marvel, a charlatan fortune-teller, persuades Dorothy to go home because Aunt Em is heartbroken. She returns just as a tornado approaches the farm. Unable to get into the locked storm cellar, Dorothy takes cover in the farmhouse and is knocked unconscious as the tornado lifts the house and drops it intact onto an unknown land.

Dorothy awakens and is greeted by a good witch named [[Glinda]], who floats down in a bubble and explains that Dorothy has landed in Munchkinland in the [[Land of Oz]], and that the Munchkins are celebrating because the house landed on the [[Wicked Witch of the East]]. Her sister, the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], suddenly appears. Before she can seize her deceased sister's [[ruby slippers]], Glinda magically transports them onto Dorothy's feet and tells her to keep them on. Because the Wicked Witch has no power in Munchkinland, she leaves, but swears vengeance upon Dorothy and Toto. Glinda tells Dorothy to follow the [[yellow brick road]] to the Emerald City, the home of the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]], as he might know how to help her return home as the bubble makes her vanish and float away.

Along the way, Dorothy meets the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], who wants a brain; the [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]], who wants a heart; and the [[Cowardly Lion]], who wants courage. The group reaches the Emerald City, despite the efforts of the Wicked Witch. Dorothy is initially denied an audience with the Wizard by his guard, but the guard relents due to Dorothy's grief, and the four are led into the Wizard's chambers. The Wizard appears as a giant ghostly head and tells them he will grant their wishes if they bring him the Wicked Witch's broomstick.

During their quest, Dorothy and Toto are captured by [[Winged monkeys|flying monkeys]] and taken to the Wicked Witch, but the ruby slippers protect her and Toto manages to escape, leading the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion to the castle. They free Dorothy, but are pursued and finally cornered by the Witch and her guards. The Witch taunts them and sets fire to the Scarecrow's arm. When Dorothy throws a bucket of water onto the Scarecrow, she inadvertently splashes the Witch, causing her to melt away.

The Witch's guards gratefully give Dorothy her broomstick, and the four return to the Wizard, but he tells them to return tomorrow. When Toto pulls back a curtain, the ""Wizard"" is revealed to be an ordinary man operating machinery that projects a ghostly image of his face. The four travelers confront the Wizard, who insists he is a good man at heart, but confesses to being a humbug. He then ""grants"" the wishes of Dorothy's three friends by giving them tokens to confirm that they have the qualities they sought.

The Wizard reveals that he, like Dorothy, is from Kansas and accidentally arrived in Oz in a hot air balloon. When he offers to take Dorothy back to Kansas with him aboard his balloon, she accepts, but Toto jumps off and Dorothy goes after him, and the balloon accidentally lifts off with just the Wizard aboard. Glinda reappears and tells Dorothy she always had the power to return to Kansas using the ruby slippers, but had to find that out for herself. After sharing a tearful farewell with her friends, Dorothy heeds Glinda's instructions by tapping her heels three times and repeating, ""There's no place like home.""

Dorothy is transported back to Kansas, where she awakens in her own bed. Aunt Em attends to her while Uncle Henry and the farm hands stand by. Professor Marvel stops in as Dorothy describes Oz, telling the farm hands and the Professor they were there too, and they smile, humoring her. As Dorothy hugs Toto, she gratefully exclaims, ""Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!""","Adventure, Family, Fantasy","starring       = {{Plainlist|

<!-- KEEP PLOT SUMMARY WITHIN 700 WORDS PER [[WP:FILMPLOT]] -->
The family of wealthy mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey attends his 85th birthday party at his [[Massachusetts]] estate. The next morning, Harlan's housekeeper Fran discovers him dead with a slit throat. Police detectives Lieutenant Elliot and Trooper Wagner believe Harlan died by suicide, but private detective Benoit Blanc is anonymously hired to investigate Harlan's death. Blanc learns Harlan had strained relationships with his family members, giving several of them plausible motives for murder.

Unbeknown to Blanc, Harlan's nurse Marta Cabrera believes she injected Harlan with a lethal dose of [[morphine]] after mixing up his medications the night after the party. To protect Marta from the consequences of the ""irreversible overdose"", Harlan instructed Marta to create a false alibi and then slit his own throat. Marta cannot lie without vomiting, so she gives accurate but incomplete answers when questioned. She agrees to assist Blanc's investigation and conceals evidence incriminating her. At the reading of Harlan's [[Will and testament|will]], Marta is bequeathed his entire fortune, stunning the Thrombeys. Harlan's grandson Ransom Drysdale helps Marta flee but manipulates her into confessing to him. Ransom offers further assistance in exchange for a portion of Marta's inheritance. Meanwhile, the other Thrombeys unsuccessfully attempt to convince Marta to renounce the inheritance.

Marta receives a blackmail note containing a partial photocopy of Harlan's [[forensic toxicology|toxicology]] report. She and Ransom drive to the medical examiner's office to find it burned down. Marta receives an email proposing a meeting with the blackmailer; Blanc and the police spot them, and after a brief [[car chase]], Ransom is arrested. At the meeting, Marta finds Fran has been drugged; she performs [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and calls an ambulance. Marta confesses to Blanc but discovers Ransom has already implicated her. Out of moral obligation, Marta believes she must confess to the Thrombeys, which would invalidate the bequest under the [[slayer rule]].

At the mansion, Marta finds Fran's copy of the full toxicology report, which shows Harlan had only trace amounts of morphine in his blood. Blanc reveals his deductions to the police, Marta, and Ransom. Blanc deduces Harlan told Ransom about his will, prompting Ransom to swap Harlan's medicines to cause Marta to kill him. However, Marta actually gave Harlan the correct medication, recognizing it without reading the label due to her experience as a nurse; she only believed she had poisoned Harlan after reading the label on the bottle with the switched content. When the death was reported as a suicide, Ransom anonymously hired Blanc to entrap Marta. Fran saw Ransom tampering with the crime scene and sent him the blackmail note. After Ransom realized that Marta was not responsible for Harlan's death but believed she was, he forwarded the blackmail letter to Marta and burned down the medical examiner's office to destroy evidence of her innocence. Ransom then overdosed Fran with morphine, intending for Marta to be caught with Fran's corpse.

The hospital calls; Marta relays that Fran has survived and will implicate Ransom. Ransom insists he will avoid criminal charges because his attempt to kill Fran failed. Marta then vomits on Drysdale, revealing she lied: Fran is dead. Realizing he has confessed to the murder, and that the police officers recorded his confession, Ransom grabs a knife from Harlan's collection and attacks Marta, but the knife is a harmless retractable stage knife, and the police promptly arrest him.

Blanc tells Marta he suspected early on she played a part in Harlan's death, noting a drop of blood on her shoe. He tells Marta her innocence prevailed because she made ethical choices that obstructed Ransom's attempts to incriminate her. As Ransom is taken into custody, Marta watches from the balcony of what is now her mansion, with the Thrombeys gathered outside.","Comedy, Crime, Drama","starring = {{Plainlist|<!-- PER POSTER BILLING. -->

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. As of 30 June 2021, word count is 695. -->
Charlie Barber, a successful theater director in New York City with his own theater company, is helming a play that stars, as usual, his wife of ten years, Nicole, who is a former teenage movie actress. The couple is experiencing marital troubles and sees a mediator, who suggests they each write down what they love about one another, but Nicole is too embarrassed to read hers aloud and they decide to forgo counseling.

When Nicole is offered a starring role in a [[television pilot]] in Los Angeles, she decides to leave Charlie's company and go to live with her mother in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], taking their son, Henry, with her. Thinking the separation will only be temporary, Charlie remains in New York, as his play is moving to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Despite the couple agreeing to split amicably and forgo lawyers, Nicole—encouraged by her producer—hires Nora Fanshaw, a high-profile family lawyer, who gets Nicole to open up about how she gradually felt neglected by Charlie, and how he rejects her ideas and desires. Nicole also suspects that Charlie slept with Mary Ann, his stage manager.

Excited by the news that he has won a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]] grant, Charlie visits his family in LA, and Nicole serves him with divorce papers. He meets with Jay Marotta, a brash and expensive lawyer who urges Charlie to fight dirty, but Charlie returns to New York without hiring Jay. After receiving a phone call from Nora, who warns him to get a lawyer soon or risk losing custody of Henry, Charlie returns to LA and hires Bert Spitz, an empathetic older lawyer who favors a civil and conciliatory approach.

On Halloween, which Charlie is unexpectedly spending in LA, Henry mentions to Charlie that Nicole said she wants to stay in California permanently. Charlie calls Nicole and angrily interrogates her, and Nicole reveals she hacked his emails and found proof of his affair with Mary Ann.

Bert counsels Charlie to rent an apartment in LA to strengthen his custody case. To avoid going to court, Bert and Charlie meet with Nora and Nicole. Nora says Charlie refused to respect Nicole's wishes to move back to LA and claims Henry would prefer to stay with his mother, rather than fly back and forth between coasts. Bert advises Charlie to give in on this point, but Charlie does not want to be separated from his son and fires Bert.

Using the first installment of his fellowship grant, Charlie hires Jay. In court, Nora and Jay argue aggressively on behalf of their clients, leading to a series of [[character assassination]]s—Nora highlights Charlie's emotional distance and past infidelity, while Jay exaggerates Nicole's drinking habits and threatens criminal action for hacking Charlie's emails. Meanwhile, Nicole and Charlie try to remain friendly out of court and share time with Henry, who is increasingly annoyed by the back-and-forth. Disillusioned with the legal process, the couple decide to meet in private, but their good intentions do not keep the discussion from becoming increasingly vicious. Nicole scathingly claims that Charlie has now fully merged with his own selfishness, and Charlie confesses that he wishes Nicole was dead. Charlie breaks down in tears and apologizes, and Nicole comforts him. Shortly after their argument, they reach an agreement and finalize the divorce. However, Nora negotiates slightly better terms for Nicole behind her back, causing Nicole to feel uncomfortable.

The following Halloween, Charlie again comes to LA. He learns Nicole has a new boyfriend and is nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for directing an episode of her television series. He informs her that he has taken a residency at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and will therefore be living in LA for a while. While everyone is changing into their costumes, Charlie discovers Henry reading the list of things Nicole loves about Charlie that she wrote during mediation. Henry asks Charlie to read the rest aloud to him, and Charlie does so, becoming emotional as Nicole, unnoticed, watches from the doorway. After trick-or-treating, Nicole offers to let Charlie take Henry home, even though it is her night. She notices Charlie's shoe is untied, and, as his arms are full carrying Henry, ties it for him before he leaves.","Comedy, Drama, Romance","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK-->

469,"I, Daniel Blake","==Plot==
Daniel Blake, a widowed 59-year-old [[joiner]] from [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], has had a heart attack. Though his doctor has not allowed him to return to work, he is deemed fit to do so after a [[Work Capability Assessment]] and is denied [[Employment and Support Allowance]]. Daniel is frustrated to learn that his doctor was not contacted about this decision and thus applies for an appeal, a process Daniel finds difficult because he must complete forms online and is not computer literate.

Daniel befriends Katie Morgan, a single mother, after she is sanctioned for arriving late to her [[Jobcentre Plus|Jobcentre]] appointment. Katie and her children have just moved to Newcastle from a [[homeless shelter]] in [[London]], as there is no affordable accommodation in London. Daniel helps the family by repairing objects, teaching them how to heat rooms without electricity, and crafting wooden toys for the children.

During a [[food bank]] visit, Katie breaks down crying, having become overwhelmed by hunger due to feeding her children instead of herself. After she is caught shoplifting at a supermarket, a security guard secretly offers Katie work as a [[prostitute]]. Daniel surprises her at the [[brothel]] where she goes to work and begs her to give up the job, but Katie tearfully insists she has no other way to feed her children.

As a condition for receiving [[Jobseeker's Allowance]], Daniel must keep looking for work. He refuses a job at a garden centre because his doctor will not allow him to work yet. When his work coach tells him he must work harder to find a job or be sanctioned, Daniel spraypaints ""I, Daniel Blake, demand my appeal date before I starve"" on the side of the building. 

Daniel earns the support of bystanders, including other people claiming benefits, but is arrested and cautioned by the police. Daniel sells most of his belongings and becomes a recluse but is pulled out of his depression by Katie's daughter, Daisy, who brings him a homemade meal to repay Daniel for his kindness. On the day of Daniel's appeal, Katie accompanies him to the tribunal, where a welfare adviser tells Daniel that his case looks promising. Upon seeing the judge and doctor who will decide his fate, Daniel becomes anxious and excuses himself to use the toilet, where he suffers another heart attack and dies. 

Later, Katie reads a eulogy at his [[public health funeral]], including a speech he had intended to read at his appeal. The speech describes his feelings about how the [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare system]] failed him, and states, ""I am not a blip on a computer screen or a national insurance number, I am a man.""",Drama,"starring       = {{Plainlist|

Living in inner-city south Dublin in 1985, Conor Lalor's dad Robert<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/movie-reviews/2016/0218/768643-sing-street/ | title=Sing Street | website=[[RTÉ.ie]] | date=18 February 2016 }}</ref> struggles with his architecture practice and his marriage, and drinks and smokes to excess. At a family meeting, he announces he is taking the youngest son Conor out of his expensive school and moving him to a Christian Brothers one, [[Synge Street CBS]], which Robert asserts is of equally high repute. Conor's older brother Brendan ribs him about the change as well as about the state of the family unit.

Conor appears in his new uniform but without the regulation black shoes. School principal Br. Baxter chastises him despite Conor's pleas of being unable to afford new shoes. To avoid going shoeless, Conor paints his shoes black. 

An encounter with the school bully Barry introduces Conor to Darren, an ally and budding entrepreneur. When Conor recruits aspiring model Raphina for a music video, Darren agrees to manage his band and introduces him to multi-instrumentalist Eamon.

The band practices in Eamon's living room, playing covers until Brendan encourages him to develop the band's own style. Conor writes original songs with Eamon, describing themselves as ""futurists"". The band films their first music video wearing comical costumes; Raphina acts as [[ingénue]] and makeup artist. Conor goes into school the next day wearing make up, and Brother Baxter forcibly removes it. 

Raphina gives Conor his nickname ""Cosmo"", which she says is more in keeping with his new band's image. After spending the day filming a music video for a new song, Conor and Raphina kiss. He also stands up to his bully, Barry by pointing out the insignificance of both their lives, which greatly upsets Barry.

Robert and Penny's marriage falls apart while Raphina and Conor's relationship blossoms. Conor takes Raphina out to [[Dalkey Island]] in his granddad's motor cruiser. Here, they view the [[Roll-on/roll-off|car ferry]] leaving [[Dún Laoghaire]] for the UK and discuss Raphina's dream of leaving Ireland for [[London]].

Conor, Raphina and the band prepare to film a ''[[Back to the Future]]''-inspired music video for their new song, but Conor is disheartened when Raphina fails to show up. She reveals that she was set to leave for London with her older boyfriend, but he abandoned her. 

Hurt by her lack of disclosure and offended by her nonchalance, Conor breaks off ties with Raphina. Because of this, and his family's problems, Conor finds difficulty in writing or playing music. But Brendan urges Conor to continue so he can make a better future for himself. 

Penny and Robert announce to the family that they are getting legally separated and selling the house. Penny plans on moving in with her affair and boss, Tony, whilst Robert plans on getting a small apartment. They will share custody. An opportunity arises for the band to play live at an end-of-year party at school. Conor strikes up a friendship with Barry, offering him the chance to be the band's roadie and escape his abusive family.

Conor prepares a new song mocking Baxter, which the band performs as an encore while distributing homemade masks of Baxter's face. Raphina arrives before the band finishes and reconciles with Conor. Both of them leave the party and the school in uproar. 

After secretly saying goodbye to his family later that night, Conor and Raphina persuade Brendan to drive them to Dalkey, so they can escape in the motor cruiser and head to London. At the harbour, Brendan and Conor embrace. Conor and Raphina sail out to sea, following the ferry across the rough [[Irish Sea]] to a new life in London. Brendan watches them disappear into the distance and cheers, overjoyed that his younger brother has left to go on to greater things.","Comedy, Drama, Music",,"director       = [[John Carney (director)|John Carney]]

He explains that the realm will soon be destroyed during the prophesied apocalypse [[Ragnarok (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ragnarök]], once Surtur unites his crown with the Eternal Flame that burns in [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Odin's vault|Odin's vault]]. Thor frees himself, defeats Surtur, and takes his crown, believing he has prevented Ragnarök. Thor returns to Asgard to find [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]] gone and his estranged brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] posing as Odin. He forces Loki to help find their father, who Loki put a spell on after his presumed sacrifice years before.

With directions from [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]], they find Odin in Norway. Unpossessed, Odin explains that he is dying, Ragnarök is imminent despite Thor's efforts, and his death will free his firstborn child, [[Hela (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hela]], from [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Hel|Hel]], a prison she was sealed in long ago. Hela, a sibling Thor and Loki did not know existed, was the leader of Asgard's armies and conquered the [[Nine Realms (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nine Realms]] with Odin, but he imprisoned her and wrote her out of history after she became too bloodthirsty and did not share his views on peace.

Odin dies and Hela appears, destroying Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mjolnir]]. She pursues the two as they attempt to flee through the [[Bifrost (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bifröst Bridge]], knocking them out into space. Arriving in Asgard, Hela defeats its army, slays the [[Warriors Three]], and resurrects the ancient dead who once fought with her, including her giant wolf [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Fenris|Fenris]]. She appoints the Asgardian [[Skurge (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Skurge]] as her executioner. Hela plans to use the Bifröst to expand Asgard's empire, but Heimdall takes the sword that controls the Bifröst.

Meanwhile, Thor crash-lands on [[Sakaar (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sakaar]], a garbage planet surrounded by [[wormhole]]s. A slave trader designated [[Valkyrie (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scrapper 142]] subdues him with an obedience disk and sells him as a [[gladiator]] to Sakaar's ruler, the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Grandmaster]], with whom Loki has already ingratiated himself. Thor recognizes 142 as a [[Valkyrior|Valkyrie]], one of a legendary force of female warriors who were killed fighting Hela eons ago. Thor is forced to compete in the Grandmaster's [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]], facing his friend [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hulk]]. Summoning lightning, Thor gets the upper hand, but the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure Hulk's victory. Still enslaved after the fight, Thor attempts to convince Hulk and 142 to help him save Asgard, but neither is willing.

Thor finds the [[Quinjet (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Quinjet]] that brought Hulk to Sakaar. A recording of [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] causes Hulk to transform back into Bruce Banner for the first time since leaving Sokovia. 142 decides to help Thor save Asgard. Loki helps them steal one of the Grandmaster's ships. They liberate the other gladiators who, incited by two aliens named [[Korg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Korg]] and [[Miek (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Miek]], stage a revolution. Loki again attempts to betray his brother, but Thor anticipates this and incapacitates him. Thor, Banner, and 142 escape through a wormhole to Asgard, where Hela's forces attack Heimdall and the Asgardian citizens. Hulk defeats Fenris; Loki and the gladiators arrive to help, and a repentant Skurge sacrifices himself to save the citizens.

Thor, battling Hela, loses his right eye and has a vision of Odin that helps him realize only Ragnarök can stop her, as she is too powerful. He sends Loki to trigger Ragnarök by placing Surtur's crown in the Eternal Flame. Surtur is reborn and destroys Asgard, killing Hela.

During [[World War II#Axis collapse and Allied victory (1944–45)|the collapse]] of [[Nazi Germany]] in the city of Falkenheim,{{Efn-la|According to a bulletin seen in the film, the city's official name is Stadt Falkenheim, literally 'City of Falkenheim'.}} ten-year-old Johannes ""Jojo"" Betzler joins the ''[[Deutsches Jungvolk]]'', the junior section of the [[Hitler Youth|Hitler Youth (HJ)]]. Heavily indoctrinated with [[Nazism|Nazi ideals]], he has an [[imaginary friend]] named Adolf, a buffoonish version of [[Adolf Hitler]]. The local HJ training camp is run by the conflicted [[Hauptmann|Captain]] Klenzendorf. Though a fanatic, Jojo is nicknamed ""Jojo Rabbit"" after refusing to kill a rabbit to prove his worthiness. Pepped up by Adolf, he returns to prove himself, throwing a ''[[Stielhandgranate]]'' by himself that explodes at his feet, severely scarring himself and injuring his leg in the process. His mother Rosie insists to the now-demoted Klenzendorf that Jojo still be included, giving him small tasks like spreading [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|propaganda]] leaflets.

Alone at home one day, Jojo discovers Elsa Korr, a teenage [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish]] girl and his late sister Inge's former friend, hiding behind the walls of Inge's attic bedroom. Jojo is both terrified of and aggressive towards Elsa. The two are left at an [[impasse]], as the revelation of Rosie's hiding of Elsa would lead to the execution of all three of them. Inspired by an offhand rant by Klenzendorf, Jojo continues to interact with her to uncover her ""Jew secrets"" and make a picture book titled ''Yoohoo Jew'',{{efn-la|German: ''Yoohoo Jude''}} allowing people to easily recognize her kind. Despite this, he finds himself clashing with innocence, and slowly forming a friendship with her. Elsa is both saddened and amused by Jojo's radical beliefs, using surreal [[antisemitic trope]]s to challenge his [[dogma]]tism. Jojo slowly becomes infatuated with the strong-willed and kind Elsa, frequently forging love letters from her fiancé Nathan, and begins questioning his beliefs, causing Adolf to scold him over his diminishing patriotism.

Gradually, Rosie is revealed to be part of the [[German resistance to Nazism]], spreading anti-Nazi messages around town.{{Efn-la|The message reads ""<u>Befreit</u> Deutschland – ''Bekämpft'' die Partei"", which is translated to ""<u>Free</u> Germany – ''Fight'' the Party"".}} One day while she is out, the [[Gestapo]] come to investigate; Klenzendorf arrives and helps Jojo and Elsa deceive the Gestapo regarding Elsa's identity. Later, Jojo finds Rosie has been executed at a [[gallows]] in the public square. Devastated, he returns home and tries to stab Elsa before breaking down in tears. Elsa comforts him and also reveals that Jojo's lost father has been working against Hitler from abroad. Jojo's beliefs on Nazism quickly shift, as he sees the regime's inhumanity. With no money, he begins to scavenge food for them both from waste bins around the city.

Following the [[death of Adolf Hitler]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] initiate an [[offensive (military)|offensive]] on Falkenheim.{{efn-la|Identified off-screen as the Battle of Falkenheim.<ref name="":19"" />}} Weakened, the civilian population including the ''Jungvolk'' is pressed into combat service. Jojo hides until it ends with an Allied victory. As a ''Jungvolk'', he is seized by [[Red Army|Soviet soldiers]] alongside Klenzendorf, who comforts him over the death of Rosie, tells him to look after Elsa, and tears off his ''Jungvolk'' coat while calling him a Jew so the Soviets do not harm him. After saving Jojo, Klenzendorf is [[Execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]]. Fearing that Elsa will leave him, Jojo tells her [[Hypothetical Axis victory in World War II|Germany won the war]]. Recognizing her despair, he forges a letter from Nathan, claiming that he and Jojo have figured out a way to smuggle her to [[Paris]]. Elsa confesses that Nathan died of [[tuberculosis]] the previous year. Jojo tells her he loves her, but she tells him she loves him as a brother. A disheveled Adolf angrily confronts Jojo for siding with Elsa, but Jojo kicks him out a window.

Hank flies home to Chicago after vacationing with the couple and their children on the Greek [[Peloponnese]] peninsula, and lives with his mother, Jesse's ex-wife.

Jesse is a successful novelist, while Céline is at a career crossroads, considering a job with the French government. The couple discuss their concerns over Hank, as well as Céline's career, and reflect on love and life over dinner with friends. Their friends pay for a hotel room for the couple; while walking to the hotel, Jesse and Céline reminisce about their initial meetings, and wonder if they would become a couple if they met in their present state.

After reaching the hotel, they begin to get intimate but are interrupted by a phone call from Hank, who seems to have bonded with Céline more than Jesse. They eventually have a fierce argument, expressing fears about the strength of their relationship.

<!-- As per WP:FILMPLOT, limit plot summaries for featured film articles between 400 and 700 words. -->
In a dystopian 2023, [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] robots hunt and kill [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], as well as humans who either possess the genetic potential to have mutant offspring or try to protect them. In [[Moscow]], they attack X-Men survivors [[Kitty Pryde]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]], and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]]. The mutants sacrifice themselves to buy Kitty enough time to send Bishop's consciousness a few days [[Time travel|into the past]] to warn the others of the coming attack and ensure their survival.

Having averted the attack, the group retreats to a remote Chinese temple and are joined by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Logan (film character)|Logan]], [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Charles Xavier]], and [[Magneto (film character)|Erik Lehnsherr]]. Xavier explains that the Sentinels were originally conceived by [[Bolivar Trask]], a weapons designer whom [[Mystique (film character)|Raven Darkhölme]] assassinated in 1973. In response, the government captured Raven and experimented on her, using her DNA to create Sentinels capable of adapting to any mutant power. Xavier plans to go back in time to 1973 and prevent Trask's assassination in the hopes of altering the future. However, upon learning that time-traveling too far would kill Xavier, Logan volunteers instead, as his regenerative abilities would allow him to survive.

Awakening in 1973, Logan goes to the [[X-Mansion]], learning from [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]] that the school has been closed for years due to the [[Vietnam War]], and Lehnsherr has been imprisoned for [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinating]] [[John F. Kennedy|JFK]]. A young, broken Xavier has turned to [[alcoholism]] and frequently uses a serum that allows him to walk, but at the cost of his telepathic abilities. Hoping to reunite with Raven, Xavier agrees to help Logan. They recruit [[Peter Maximoff]], a mutant with superhuman speeds, and break Lehnsherr out of [[The Pentagon]], learning that he was in fact attempting to save JFK, who was also a mutant.

Raven discovers Trask has been experimenting on mutants and plots to assassinate him at the [[Paris Peace Accords]], but Xavier, McCoy, and Logan foil her attempt. Lehnsherr attempts to kill Raven, believing this would change the future, so McCoy fights him, allowing Raven to escape but publicly exposing them as mutants. Trask takes advantage of this and convinces President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] to authorize the Sentinel program.

Lehnsherr retrieves his helmet and secretly takes control of Trask's Sentinel prototypes by infusing them with steel. Returning to the X-Mansion, Xavier abandons the serum and, by reading Logan's mind, communicates with his future self, who inspires him to protect the future between mutants and humans. After Xavier uses his mutant-tracking computer [[Cerebro]] to find Raven, he, McCoy, and Logan travel to [[Washington, D.C.]] to stop her from assassinating Trask.

At a ceremony where Nixon unveils the Sentinels, the three search for Raven. Lehnsherr appears, activates the Sentinels, and barricades the [[White House]] by lifting the [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]] over it. During the battle, Lehnsherr impales Logan with a rebar and throws him into the [[Potomac River]]. Nixon, Trask, and a disguised Raven retreat to the [[Presidential Emergency Operations Center|White House Bunker]]. However, Lehnsherr rips the bunker out of the building to kill everyone inside. In 2023, the X-Men make their last stand as an onslaught of Sentinels attacks the temple, with most of the mutants perishing while trying to buy more time. In 1973, Raven reveals herself and subdues Lehnsherr with a plastic gun, saving Nixon and his cabinet. Before she can kill Trask, Xavier telepathically convinces her to spare him, leading the public to realize that a mutant saved the President. As a result, the Sentinel program is decommissioned, altering the timeline and erasing the dark future of 2023 from history. The mutants in the past depart separately; Trask is later arrested for selling military secrets to foreign governments.

Logan reawakens in 2023 at the X-Mansion to find that Xavier's school is thriving and the X-Men are all alive, including [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Rogue]], [[Jean Grey (film character)|Jean Grey]], and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]]. Logan asks Xavier for information about modern history from 1973 to the present. Upon realizing that the Logan from the original timeline has returned, Xavier assents. Back in 1973, Logan is rescued by Raven, having disguised herself as Major [[William Stryker]].

 <!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 to 700 words. -->
In 2015, an alien race known as ""Mimics"" lands in Germany and swiftly conquers much of [[continental Europe]], killing millions. By 2020, humanity has formed a global military alliance, the United Defense Force (UDF), to combat the Mimics. However, victory remained elusive until the recent Battle of [[Verdun]], which was secured by the celebrated war hero Sergeant Rita Vrataski.

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the UDF masses forces for a major invasion of [[France]]. General Brigham orders [[Public affairs (military)|public affairs]] officer Major William Cage to cover the offensive from the frontline, but the inexperienced and cowardly Cage attempts to blackmail Brigham into rescinding the order. 

Brigham has Cage arrested, demoted to Private and sent to the military base at [[Heathrow Airport]] to join the invasion as infantry. He is assigned to Master Sergeant Farell and the misfit J-Squad, who dislike and belittle him. 

The following day, the invasion forces land on a French beach but are ambushed and massacred by Mimics. Cage uses a [[Claymore mine]] to kill a larger ""Alpha"" Mimic, becoming covered in its blood and mortally wounding himself in the ensuing explosion.

Cage suddenly awakens at Heathrow, finding he is reliving the previous morning. He makes failed attempts to warn against the invasion and experiences multiple loops in which he dies on the beach and awakens at Heathrow, his battlefield knowledge and skills increasing with each loop. He tries to save Vrataski's life so she can lead them but, after recognizing his apparent prescience, she allows herself to die, ordering Cage to find her on his next loop. 

Cage quickly convinces Vrataski of the reset because she gained the same power after exposure to an Alpha's blood. Her loops enabled her, an initially inexperienced soldier, to win at Verdun, but a later blood transfusion removed the power. 

Vrataski takes Cage to Mimic expert Dr. Carter, who explains the creatures are a [[superorganism]] controlled by a single, gigantic ""Omega"" Mimic. Whenever the Alpha Mimics are killed, the Omega restarts a loop and adjusts its tactics until the Mimics win. Vrataski realizes the Mimics allowed the UDF victory at Verdun to make them overconfident in their new [[Powered exoskeleton|mech-suits]] and lure them into overcommitting their forces in retaking Europe, allowing the Mimics to exterminate most of the resistance.

Cage spends many loops training with Vrataski so they can reach the Omega, but he begins to care for her and struggles after seeing her repeatedly die. He experiences a vision of the Omega concealed in a German dam, and he and Vrataski seek it out. 

During the journey, the pair bond, but Vrataski remains distant, having seen someone she cared about die hundreds of times at Verdun. She eventually determines that this is not the first loop in which they approached the Omega. Cage reveals that she always dies before reaching the dam, regardless of his actions, and he is unwilling to kill the Omega and end the loops if she will remain dead. 

Upset, Vrataski attempts to leave but is killed by a Mimic. Despondent, during the next loop, Cage travels to the dam alone. He learns the vision was a trap and is ambushed by an Alpha, but Cage drowns before it can remove his power.

To find the Omega, Cage and Vrataski sneak into General Brigham's office and pressure him into handing over a prototype transponder designed by Carter. Having used it to locate the Omega beneath the [[Louvre Pyramid]] in [[Paris]], Cage is knocked unconscious during their escape and given a blood transfusion for his injuries, removing his power. 

Vrataski frees Cage, and he uses his detailed knowledge of J-Squad to convince them to help destroy the Omega. They fly to Paris, where the squad members sacrifice themselves to ensure Cage and Vrataski reach the Louvre. 

Cornered by an Alpha, Vrataski kisses Cage, lamenting that she does not have more time to get to know him. The Alpha kills Vrataski and mortally wounds Cage, but he drops several grenades that destroy the Omega and bathe him in its blood.

Cage awakens days earlier to a news announcement that all Mimics are dead following a mysterious energy surge in Paris. Cage returns to Heathrow and finds Vrataski. Oblivious to his identity, she inquires what he wants; Cage smiles.","Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","starring       = {{Plainlist|

485,The Irishman,"== Plot ==
<!--PER MANUAL OF STYLE, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS-->
In a [[nursing home]], elderly [[Irish-American]] [[World War II]] veteran [[Frank Sheeran]] recounts his time as a [[hitman]] for the [[American Mafia|Italian-American Mafia]].

In 1950s [[Philadelphia]], Sheeran works as a [[Trade union|union]] delivery truck driver, where he starts selling some of the meat shipments to a local Philadelphia Italian-American gangster known as ""Skinny Razor"", a member of the [[Philadelphia crime family]] headed by [[Angelo Bruno]]. After the delivery company accuses Sheeran of theft, union lawyer [[Bill Bufalino]] gets the case dismissed when Sheeran refuses to name his customers to the judge.

Bill introduces Sheeran to his cousin [[Russell Bufalino]], head of [[Bufalino crime family|his namesake crime family]] in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Sheeran begins to carry out jobs for him, as well as members of the [[South Philadelphia]] underworld, including ""painting houses"", a [[euphemism]] for contract killing.

Sheeran is soon introduced to [[Jimmy Hoffa]], head of the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]], who has financial ties with the Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family. He is struggling to deal with fellow rising Teamster [[Anthony Provenzano|Anthony ""Tony Pro"" Provenzano]], in addition to mounting pressure from the federal government. Hoffa becomes close with Sheeran and his family, especially his daughter Peggy; in turn Sheeran becomes his chief [[bodyguard]].

After the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]] of [[John F. Kennedy]], Bufalino is thrilled while Hoffa is furious. Kennedy's brother, [[Robert F. Kennedy]], whom he appointed [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], forms a [[United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management#Impact on key participants|""Get Hoffa"" squad]] to bring down Hoffa, who is eventually arrested and convicted in 1964 for [[jury tampering]].

While Hoffa is in prison, his replacement as Teamsters president, [[Frank Fitzsimmons|Frank ""Fitz"" Fitzsimmons]], misuses the union's [[pension]] fund and gives interest-free loans to the Mafia. Hoffa's relationship with Tony Pro, himself arrested for [[extortion]], also deteriorates beyond repair when Hoffa refuses to help restore his forfeited pension. Hoffa's sentence is [[Commutation (law)|commuted]] by President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1971, although he is forbidden from partaking in any Teamsters activities until 1980.

Despite his [[parole]] terms, Hoffa undertakes a plan to reclaim his power atop the Teamsters. His growing disrespect for other Teamster leaders and his intention to separate the union from the Mafia begin to worry Russell. During a dinner in Sheeran's honor in October 1973, Russell pleads Sheeran to confront Hoffa and warn him that the heads of the crime families are displeased with his behavior. Hoffa then informs Sheeran that he ""knows things"" that Russell and the [[Crime boss|dons]] of other families are unaware of and claims that what he knows makes him untouchable, for if anything ever happened to him, they would all end up in prison.

In 1975, while on their way to the wedding of Bill's daughter, Russell reluctantly informs Sheeran that the dons have become fed up with Hoffa and have sanctioned his murder. Russell further informs Sheeran that he must serve as the triggerman, knowing he might otherwise try to warn or save Hoffa. The two drive to a private airport where Sheeran boards a plane to [[Detroit]].

Hoffa, who had scheduled a meeting at a local restaurant with Tony Pro and [[Anthony Giacalone]], is surprised to see Sheeran arriving late, with Hoffa's unsuspecting foster son Chuckie O'Brien and loan shark [[Sally Bugs]]. They tell Hoffa the meeting was moved to a house where Tony Pro and Russell are waiting, so Sheeran is to drive him over there. Entering the house, Hoffa realizes it is empty and that he has been set up. He turns around to leave, at which point Sheeran shoots him dead at [[point-blank range]] and leaves the gun on his body by the entrance. After Sheeran departs, two other mobsters wrap up the body and cremate it in secret.

Invoking their [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights in a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] investigation into Hoffa's disappearance, Sheeran, Russell, Tony Pro, and others are eventually convicted and incarcerated on various charges unrelated to Hoffa's murder and die one by one in prison.

Sheeran is eventually released and placed in a nursing home. He tries to reconcile with his alienated daughters. Peggy, however, suspecting his involvement in Hoffa's disappearance has since severed all contact with him. Sheeran begins seeing a [[Catholic]] priest assigned to the nursing home, who assured him an overall [[Absolution#Catholic Church|absolution]] for whatever crimes committed or denied over his lifetime. As the priest leaves, Sheeran asks him to leave the door slightly ajar, emulating one of Hoffa's safety habits.","Biography, Crime, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--ACCORDING TO THE BILLING IN CREDITS-->

489,District 9,"==Plot==
In 1982, a giant extraterrestrial spaceship arrives and hovers over the South African city of Johannesburg. An investigation team finds over a million malnourished aliens inside, and the South African government relocates them to a camp called District 9. However, over the years, it turns into a slum, and locals often complain that the aliens{{emdash}}derogatorily called ""[[Parktown prawn|prawn]]s""{{emdash}}are filthy, ignorant lawbreakers who bleed resources from humans.

Following unrest between the aliens and locals, the government hires Multinational United (MNU), a giant weapons manufacturer, to relocate the aliens to a new camp outside the city. Piet Smit, an MNU executive, appoints an MNU employee and his son-in-law, Wikus van de Merwe, to lead the relocation. Meanwhile, three aliens, Christopher Johnson, his young son CJ, and his friend Paul, search a District 9 garbage dump for alien fuel in Prawn technology, which Christopher has had them spend the last 20 years synthesizing enough of to enact his plan. They finally finish in Paul's shack as the relocation begins, but when Wikus comes to serve Paul a notice, he finds the hidden container with the fuel and accidentally sprays some of it in his face while confiscating it. Koobus Venter, a cruel MNU mercenary, kills Paul.

Wikus begins mutating into a Prawn, starting with his left arm injured after the fuel exposure. He is immediately taken to the brutal MNU lab, where researchers discover his chimeric DNA grants him the ability to operate Prawn weaponry, which is biologically restricted for them. Wanting to capture this human/alien hybridity before Wikus fully transforms, Smit orders Wikus' body to be [[vivisect]]ed and harvested for its profitable properties. Wikus, however, overpowers the lab personnel and escapes. While Venter's forces hunt for him, a [[smear campaign|smear story]] is broadcast, one that reaches Wikus' wife Tania (Smit's daughter) claiming Wikus is a wanted fugitive who has contracted a [[sexually transmitted disease|contagious disease]] from copulating with aliens.

Wikus takes refuge in District 9, finding Christopher and the spaceship's concealed command module [[shuttlecraft|dropship]] underneath his house. Christopher explains to Wikus that the confiscated fuel is crucial to his plan of reactivating the dropship, and if he can get them in the dropship to the mothership, he can cure Wikus. Wikus attempts to acquire weapons from the District 9 Nigerian arms dealer, Obesandjo, who wants to eat Wikus's alien arm to gain alien abilities. Wikus, however, seizes an alien weapon and escapes.

Wikus and Christopher force themselves through MNU to the lab to retrieve the fuel. However, after seeing the brutal experiments MNU has performed on his people in the lab{{emdash}}including a dissected Paul{{emdash}}Christopher tells Wikus he must return home as fast as possible for help and cannot undo Wikus' mutation until he returns in three years due to the limited supply of fuel. Enraged, Wikus knocks Christopher down and attempts to fly the module to the mothership, but Venter's forces shoot it down. Venter captures Wikus and Christopher, but Obesandjo's gang ambushes the MNU convoy and seizes Wikus.

Meanwhile, CJ, remaining hidden in the dropship, remotely activates the mothership and a large robotic alien battle suit in Obesandjo's base. The suit guns down the Nigerians, and Wikus enters the suit and rescues Christopher from the mercenaries. Heading to the dropship, the two come under heavy fire, and Wikus decides to stay behind to fend off the mercenaries and buy time for Christopher to escape, who promises to return after three years and heal Wikus. After all of the other mercenaries are killed, Venter finally cripples the suit and is about to execute Wikus when slum Prawns attack and dismember him alive. Christopher makes it into the dropship with CJ, and the dropship is levitated via a [[tractor beam]] back into the mothership, which leaves Earth.

MNU's experiments are exposed, and the aliens are moved to the new camp named District 10. Tania finds a metal flower on her doorstep, giving her hope that Wikus is still alive. Wikus, now fully transformed into a Prawn, is shown in a junkyard crafting flowers for his wife.","Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist|

495,In Bruges,"==Plot==
<!-- Plot must remain below 700 per WP:FILMPLOT. Work within the limit. -->
Carrying out orders, inexperienced [[contract killing|hitman]] Ray shoots a priest during [[Sacrament of Penance|confession]], but accidentally kills a young boy who is also in church. He and his mentor Ken are sent to [[Bruges]] by their employer Harry, where they are to await further instructions. Ken finds the city beautiful and relaxing, while Ray is bored and hates it.

They chance upon a film shoot involving a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] actor, which amuses Ray. Ray is attracted to Chloë, a local drug dealer [[Side job|moonlighting]] as a [[production assistant]]. He takes her to a restaurant, where he gets into an argument with a Canadian couple (mistaking them for Americans) and punches them. Chloë takes Ray to her apartment where they begin to have sex, but her ex-boyfriend Eirik appears and threatens Ray with a handgun. Ray effortlessly disarms the small-time criminal and fires the gun, loaded with [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]], in Eirik's face, blinding him in one eye. Chloë admits that she and Eirik rob tourists, but insists she had told Eirik that Ray was not a target. As Chloë drives Eirik to the hospital, Ray pockets the gun and helps himself to a handful of live rounds as well as Chloë's stash of drugs. He and Ken spend a debauched night with the dwarf actor, Jimmy, who takes [[cocaine]] and rants about a coming [[Ethnic conflict|war between blacks and whites]].

Harry calls Ken and orders him to kill Ray, on the principle that killing a child, even accidentally, is unforgivable. With a handgun supplied by Harry's local contact Yuri, Ken tracks Ray to a park and reluctantly prepares to kill him. Ray, however, distraught at his killing of the boy, prepares to kill himself with Eirik's loaded gun. Seeing this, Ken stops Ray, informs him of Harry's order and tells him to leave Bruges to have a fresh start. He gives Ray some money and puts him on a train to another city, while confiscating his gun to prevent a further [[suicide attempt]]. Ken reports the truth back to Harry, who immediately sets out for Bruges, furious at the insubordination. He picks up a gun at Yuri's, and Eirik, Yuri's son, learns of his intention.

Ray's train stops, and the police escort him back to Bruges for attacking the Canadians. Chloë bails him out and the two share a drink on the market square beneath the [[Belfry of Bruges]]. Harry spots Ken sitting outside a cafe. As the two have drinks, Harry boasts that if he himself had killed a child, he would have immediately taken his own life. Ken argues that Ray is trying to better himself and deserves a chance at [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]]. Harry is not convinced. Ken suggests they ascend the bell tower for a shootout away from bystanders. At the top, Ken says he accepts whatever punishment Harry intends. A conflicted Harry cannot bring himself to kill Ken, so he shoots him in the leg as punishment for not killing Ray. Seeing Ray at the square, Eirik climbs the tower to inform Harry, who is helping Ken down the tower. Ken tries to disarm Harry, who shoots Ken in the neck and rushes down. Bleeding heavily, Ken drags himself back to the top of the tower and jumps into the square. Ray rushes to Ken, who warns him of Harry's arrival just before he dies.

Harry chases Ray to the hotel; Marie, the pregnant owner, refuses Harry entry, even when he draws his gun. To protect the owner and her unborn child, Harry and Ray agree to continue the chase on the canal. Ray, armed with Eirik's loaded gun, jumps onto a passing barge but drops the gun. Harry wounds Ray with a shot from a distance. Ray collapses on the street where Jimmy's film is shooting. Harry catches up and repeatedly shoots Ray. One of the bullets hits Jimmy (costumed as a schoolboy), blowing his head open. Mistakenly believing that he has killed a child, Harry, despite protest from Ray, kills himself. Ray is carried past Chloë, Marie and Eirik into an ambulance. In narration, Ray reflects on the nature of [[hell]], speculating that it is an eternity in the city of Bruges, and recalls that he really, really hoped he would not die.","Comedy, Crime, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|

496,The Man from Earth,"==Plot==
Professor John Oldman is packing his belongings onto his truck, preparing to move to a new home. His colleagues show up to give him an impromptu farewell party: Harry, a [[biologist]]; Edith, an [[art history]] professor and devout Christian; Dan, an anthropologist; Sandy, a historian who is in (unrequited) love with John; Art, an archaeologist; and his younger student Linda.

As John's colleagues press him to explain the reason for his departure, he picks up from a reference to [[Magdalenian]] cultures by Dan and slowly, and somewhat reluctantly, reveals that he was born in the [[Paleolithic]] period. He states that he has lived for more than 14 millennia, and that he relocates every ten years to keep others from realizing that he does not age. He begins his tale under the guise of a possible science-fiction story, but eventually stops speaking in hypotheticals and begins answering questions from a first-person perspective. His colleagues refuse to believe his story but accept it as a working hypothesis in order to glean his true intentions. John relates he was a [[Sumer]]ian for 2000 years, later a [[Babylonia]]n, and eventually went east to become a disciple of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]]. He claims to have had a chance to sail with [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] (admitting that at the time [[Myth of the flat Earth|he still believed the earth was flat]]) and to have befriended [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] (one of whose original paintings he apparently owns, a gift from the artist himself).

In the course of the conversation, each guest questions John's story based on knowledge from their own academic specialty. Harry struggles with how biology could allow for the possibility of a human being living for so long. Art, arguably the most skeptical of the group, questions prehistory. He exclaims that all of John's answers, although correct, could have come from any textbook; John rejoins that, like any human, his memory is imperfect and he only sees events from his own narrow, hence not omniscient, perspective. Dr. Will Gruber, a psychiatry professor who arrives at Art's request later that afternoon, questions if John feels guilt for outliving everyone he has ever known and loved. He then threatens John with a gun (later revealed to have been unloaded) before temporarily leaving.  John then learns from Harry that Will's wife had died the previous day after a long illness.  John chases after Will, expresses his condolences and John rejoins the group.

The discussion veers to religion, and John mentions that he does not follow any. Even though he does not necessarily believe in an omnipotent God, he does not discount the possibility of such a being's existence. Pressed by the group, John reluctantly reveals that in trying to take the Buddha's teachings to the west, into the eastern [[Roman Empire]], he became the inspiration for the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|Jesus story]]. After this revelation, emotions in the room run high. Edith (the representative ""true believer"" of the group{{clarify|date=July 2024|reason=Believer in what? John's story? Christianity? And what does ""representative"" mean here?}}) begins crying. Will, who has returned after saying he drove around and didn’t know where else to go, demands that John end his tale and give the group a sense of closure by admitting it was all a hoax. He threatens to have John involuntarily committed for psychiatric evaluation should he refuse to do so. John appears to ruminate over his response before finally ""confessing"" to everyone that his story was a prank.

John's friends leave the party with various reactions: Edith is relieved; Harry indicates an open mind; Art never wants to see John again; Will still believes John needs professional help; Sandy and Linda clearly believe John; Dan is heavily implied to believe John. After everyone else but Will and Sandy have left, Will overhears John and Sandy's conversation; which suggests the story could be true after all. John mentions some of the pseudonyms he has used over the years, and Will realizes one in particular was his father's name. He asks John specific questions that only a very close acquaintance could answer. When John answers them all correctly, Will has an emotional breakdown, suffers a heart attack and dies in John’s arms. After the body has been taken away, Sandy realizes that (if the story is true) this is the first time John has seen one of his grown children die. John wordlessly gets in his truck and starts to drive to an unknown destination. Having reconsidered, he then stops and waits for Sandy, who slowly walks over to the truck.","Drama, Fantasy, Mystery",,"director    = [[Richard Schenkman]]

497,Letters from Iwo Jima,"==Plot==
In 2005, Japanese [[archaeologist]]s explore tunnels on [[Iwo Jima]], where they find something in the dirt.

In 1944 [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]], [[Private (rank)|Private First Class]] Saigo, a [[Conscription|conscripted]] baker who misses his wife and newly-born daughter, is digging beach trenches with his platoon when [[Lieutenant General]] [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]] arrives to take command of the garrison. He saves Saigo from a beating by Captain Tanida for being ""unpatriotic"", and orders the garrison to tunnel underground defenses throughout the island.

Kuribayashi and [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Kazoku|Baron]] [[Takeichi Nishi]], a famous [[Olympic medalist|Olympic gold medalist]] [[show jumping|show jumper]], clash with the other officers, who disagree with Kuribayashi's [[defense in depth]] strategy. Kuribayashi learns that Japan cannot send reinforcements and thus believes that the tunnels and mountain bunkers stand a better chance of holding out than relying entirely on the beach defenses. Poor nutrition and unsanitary conditions take their toll, and many die of [[dysentery]]. Replacement troops arrive, including [[Army ranks of the Japanese Empire during World War II|Superior Private]] Shimizu, whom Saigo suspects is a spy from the [[Kempeitai]] sent to report on disloyal soldiers.

Soon, American aircraft and warships bombard the island. A few days later, [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] land and suffer heavy casualties, but they overcome the beach defenses and attack [[Mount Suribachi]]. While delivering a message from Captain Tanida to Colonel Adachi, Saigo overhears Kuribayashi's retreat orders over the radio; Adachi instead orders his unit to commit [[honor suicide|honorable suicide]]. Many soldiers obey except Saigo and Shimizu, who decide to retreat and fight on.

The Mount Suribachi survivors make a run for friendly lines, but Marines ambush and slaughter them. Saigo and Shimizu reach safety but are accused by Lieutenant Ito of cowardice. They are about to be [[summary execution|summarily executed]] when Kuribayashi arrives and confirms his order to retreat. Against Kuribayashi's orders, Ito leads an attack on US positions, and many soldiers are killed. Lt. Col. Nishi reprimands Ito for his insubordination; in response, Ito leaves carrying several [[land mine]]s and intends to throw himself under a US tank. Shimizu reveals to Saigo that he was dishonorably discharged from the Kempeitai because he disobeyed an order to kill a family's dog. Nishi befriends a wounded Marine and then reads a letter from the Marine's mother after he dies, garnering sympathy from the Japanese soldiers. Nishi is eventually blinded by shrapnel and orders his men to withdraw before committing suicide.

Saigo and Shimizu decide to surrender, but Shimizu and another surrendering soldier are spotted by an officer, who is ordered to shoot potential deserters. Shimizu escapes and is found by a Marine patrol. Shimizu and another Japanese prisoner are then unlawfully executed by one of their guards. Saigo and the remaining soldiers flee to Kuribayashi's position, which is ill-supplied. Saigo befriends Kuribayashi, and a counter-attack is planned. Kuribayashi orders Saigo to stay behind and destroy any vital documents, saving his life for a third time.

That night, Kuribayashi leads a final night attack on a Marine encampment. Most of his men are killed, and Kuribayashi is critically wounded and dragged away by his aide, Lt. Fujita. Meanwhile, Ito has long abandoned his suicidal mission and is captured by Marines. The next morning, Kuribayashi orders Fujita to behead him with his [[Guntō]], but Fujita is shot and killed by a Marine sniper. Saigo arrives, having buried a bag of letters before leaving headquarters. Kuribayashi asks Saigo to bury him where he will not be found, then draws his pistol — a [[M1911 pistol|M1911]] gifted to him in the US before the war — and commits suicide. Saigo dutifully buries him.

Later, a Marine platoon finds Fujita's body. Saigo reappears and attacks them, infuriated to see an American has taken Kuribayashi's pistol. Saigo is subdued and taken to the beach to recover alongside wounded Marines. Awakening on a stretcher, he glimpses the setting sun and smiles.

Returning to 2005, the archaeologists complete their digging and reveal the bag of letters that Saigo buried. As the letters spill out from the opened bag, the voices of the Japanese soldiers who wrote them are heard.","Action, Adventure, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|

Born on Christmas in 1960, Zac is one of four and later five brothers: bookish Christian, rebellious Raymond, sporty, flatulent Antoine and then Yvan. He has a special relationship with his father Gervais, but things began to fall apart as Zac's non-masculine ways start to show. Their unique relationship officially ends when Gervais comes home to find Zac dressed in his mother's clothes. Ever since then, he ""had unwittingly declared war on his father"".

At the Christmas party in 1975, Zac shotguns a joint with his cousin Brigitte's boyfriend Paul, which sparks Zac's attraction. His friend Michelle tries to kiss him, but Zac stops her with the excuse of protecting their friendship. Later on, he discovers that Brigitte is no longer with Paul. In a moment of spontaneity, Zac runs a red light on his motorcycle, only to be struck by a car and hospitalized. Zac later learns that Brigitte is back with Paul.

Zac begins a relationship with Michelle, temporarily relieving Gervais—until he sees Zac stepping out of the car with a male classmate, adjusting his crotch. Angry, Gervais has Zac see a [[Psychologist|therapist]] to [[conversion therapy|""cure""]] him of his ""homosexuality"". The therapist's conclusion is that Zac made ""a subconscious deliberate mistake"", intentionally doing it so that Gervais would catch him and find out he was ""gay"".

At the Christmas dinner in 1980, Zac and Michelle's relationship has become closer and more physical. His brother Christian announces his engagement. At Christian's wedding reception, Zac and Paul shotgun a [[joint (cannabis)|joint]] outside, but are seen by a guest who thought they were kissing. Gervais overhears this gossip, and chaos ensues. Gervais confronts Zac in the pouring rain, and Zac admittedly [[coming out|comes out]], yelling that while he was not kissing Paul, he wished he had been.

504,Shaun of the Dead,"== Plot ==
<!--Please keep plot summary between 400-700 words per WP:FILMPLOT-->
In the [[Crouch End]] area of London, 29-year-old electronics salesman Shaun is disrespected by his colleagues, does not get along with his stepfather Philip, and is dumped by his girlfriend Liz after he promises to improve himself but is unsuccessful in making decent plans for an anniversary date. At his favourite pub, the Winchester, a heartbroken Shaun gets drunk with his [[slacker]] best friend Ed. At home, Shaun and Ed's roommate Pete complains of a bite wound from a mugger and berates Shaun, telling him to stop leaning on Ed and get his life together.

The following day, a [[zombie apocalypse]] has overwhelmed London. Shaun and Ed do not notice until they encounter two zombies in their garden, whom they beat to death after throwing household implements and Shaun's record collection at them. They devise a plan to rescue Shaun's mother, Barbara, and Liz, and then wait out the crisis at the Winchester. They escape from a now-zombified Pete by stealing his car. They pick up Philip, who has been bitten, and Barbara. Ed deliberately crashes Pete's car so he can drive Philip's [[Jaguar XJ#Series 3 (1979–1992)|Jaguar Series 3]]. They fetch Liz and her flatmates David and Dianne. Philip reconciles with Shaun before becoming a zombie.

Forced to abandon the car and their weapons, they sneak through the neighbourhood and briefly encounter a group led by Shaun's friend Yvonne, with each group member resembling a [[doppelgänger]] of the other group's members. Shaun defends Barbara from a zombie and impales it with a [[Totem tennis|swingball]] pole. After imitating zombies to bypass a horde and reach the Winchester, Shaun and Ed argue when Ed answers his mobile phone, attracting the zombies' attention. David panics and breaks a window of the Winchester, forcing Shaun to lure the horde away using himself as bait before returning.

As the group takes refuge inside the Winchester, Shaun discovers that the zombies followed him, and Ed inadvertently attracts them by playing on the pub's [[slot machine]]. While fighting the pub's zombified owner, Shaun discovers that the [[Winchester rifle]] above the bar is functional, which he had previously debated with Ed. Barbara reveals she was bitten and dies after giving Liz and Shaun's relationship her approval. David attempts to shoot Barbara, but Shaun stops him, accusing David of hating him and being in love with Liz. David denies this, but Dianne admits she knows it is true. Barbara becomes a zombie, forcing a distraught Shaun to shoot her, and further fighting with David ensues.

The zombies break through a window of the pub and pull David out, devouring him alive. In a foolish and senseless attempt to save the doomed David, Dianne opens the doors to the pub and rushes into the horde of zombies using David's severed leg as a weapon. With the doors now open, zombies pour into the bar. The zombified Pete reappears in the horde and is shot by Shaun after biting Ed. Shaun, Liz, and Ed take cover behind the bar; Shaun sets the bar on fire with alcohol to serve as a barrier. The three take refuge in the cellar, where they realise they only have two bullets left. Shaun and Liz contemplate suicide while Ed volunteers to sacrifice himself. Upon discovering a small lift for kegs that opens onto the street, Shaun and Liz exit the pub while Ed buys them time by staying behind with the rifle. Yvonne arrives with the [[British Army]], who gun down the zombies before taking Shaun and Liz to safety.

Six months later, civilisation has returned to normal but with the added bonus that the surviving zombies are now used for free labour and entertainment. Liz has moved in with Shaun, who keeps the now-zombified Ed chained up in his garden shed, revealing that Ed is still at least somewhat sentient; the two play video games together in the shed.","Comedy, Horror","starring       = {{Plainlist|

<!-- Per WP: FILMPLOT, plot summaries are suggested to be between 400 and 700 words. This is only a guideline, not a policy or rule. -->
In the year 2027, eighteen years of total human infertility have led to war and global [[economic depression|depression]], pushing civilization to the brink of collapse as humanity faces extinction. The United Kingdom is one of the few remaining nations with a functioning government, and has become a [[totalitarian]] [[police state]] in which [[Refugee|refugees]] are arrested and either imprisoned, deported, or executed in [[concentration camps]].

Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical [[bureaucrat]], is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant refugee-rights group led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor; the pair separated after their son's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire [[transit papers]] for a young refugee woman named Kee. Theo obtains the documents from his cousin, a government minister, and agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a larger sum of money. Luke, a Fishes leader, drives Theo, Kee, Julian, and former midwife Miriam towards [[Canterbury]], but an armed gang ambushes them and kills Julian. Luke kills two police officers that try to question them, and the group hides Julian's body before heading to a [[safe house]].

Kee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant, making her the only known pregnant woman in the world. Julian intended to take her to the Human Project, a secret scientific research group in the [[Azores]] dedicated to curing humanity's infertility. Luke becomes the new leader of the Fishes. That night, Theo eavesdrops on a discussion and learns that the Fishes orchestrated Julian's death so that Luke could become their leader, while also intending to kill Theo and use Kee's baby as a political tool. Theo, Kee, and Miriam escape to the secluded hideaway of Jasper Palmer, Theo's friend and a former political cartoonist, whose wife Janice was [[torture]]d into [[catatonia]] by the British government for her journalism.

The group plans to reach the Human Project ship, the ''Tomorrow'', scheduled to arrive offshore at [[Bexhill-on-Sea|Bexhill]], a notorious refugee detention centre. Jasper plans to use Syd, an immigration officer to whom Jasper sells [[cannabis]], to smuggle them into Bexhill as refugees, from where they can take a rowboat and rendezvous with the ''Tomorrow''. The next day, the Fishes discover Jasper's house, forcing the group to flee. Jasper stays behind to stall them; he [[euthanize]]s Janice and their pet dog with poison before being murdered by Luke. Theo, Kee, and Miriam meet with Syd, who helps them board a bus to the camp. After Kee's [[rupture of membranes|water breaks]], a guard enters the bus to select people for execution. When he notices Kee hurting, Miriam obstructs the guard and is taken away; Theo fools him into thinking Kee just soiled herself, after which the guard leaves her alone.

Entering Bexhill, Theo and Kee meet a [[Romani people|Romani]] woman, Marichka, who provides a room where Kee gives birth to a baby girl. The next day, Syd tells the pair that war has broken out between the British military and the refugees, and that the Fishes have infiltrated the camp. He then reveals that Theo and Kee have a bounty on their heads and attempts to capture them. Theo subdues Syd with Marichka's help and the group briefly take shelter with Marichka's friends. Heading for the rowboat, they are ambushed by the Fishes, who capture Kee and the baby. As British troops attack, Theo tracks the Fishes to an apartment building under heavy fire. Theo confronts Luke, who is killed in an explosion, and Theo escorts Kee and the baby out. Awed by the baby, the British soldiers and Fishes temporarily stop fighting and allow the trio to leave. Marichka leads them to the boat but stays behind as they depart.

As British fighter jets conduct [[airstrike]]s on Bexhill, Theo and Kee row to the rendezvous point in heavy fog. Theo reveals that he was shot and wounded by Luke earlier; he teaches Kee how to [[Burping#Infants|burp her baby]], and she tells him she will name the baby girl Dylan, after Theo's and Julian's lost son. Theo smiles weakly, then loses consciousness as the ''Tomorrow'' approaches. As the screen cuts to black, children's laughter is heard.","Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi","starring       = {{Plainlist|

<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. The plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->
In [[San Diego]] 1969, child prodigy William Miller struggles to fit in. His life is further complicated after learning that his widowed college-professor mother Elaine has falsely led him to believe he is twelve years old. William is actually eleven, having started the first grade at five years old, and skipping fifth grade. Strong-willed Elaine's strict ban on [[rock music]] and her fear of pop culture have a lasting effect on her children, finally driving William's 18-year-old sister Anita to move to [[San Francisco]] and become a flight attendant.

Four years later in 1973, William, now fifteen, influenced by Anita's secret cache of rock albums, aspires to be a rock journalist, writing freelance articles for underground papers in [[San Diego]]. Rock journalist [[Lester Bangs]], impressed with William's writing, gives him a $35 assignment to review a [[Black Sabbath]] concert. William is barred from backstage until the opening band Stillwater arrives and William flatters his way in. Lead guitarist Russell Hammond takes a liking to him and his new acquaintance, veteran [[groupie]] Penny Lane, who has taken him under her wing. Despite behaving as stereotypical groupies, Penny insists she and her friends are ""band aids"", a term she invented to describe female fans that are there more for the music than for the rock stars themselves.

On seeing William's article on Black Sabbath, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' editor [[Ben Fong-Torres]] hires him to write an article about Stillwater and sends him on the road with the band aboard ""Doris"", Stillwater's aging but beloved bus. William interviews the other band members, but Russell avoids him. Tensions between Russell and lead singer Jeff Bebe become evident when the band's first T-shirt is produced, featuring Russell in full view while the rest of the band is in the shadows. William is jokingly called ""the enemy"" by the band as he is a journalist, but he gradually begins to lose his objectivity as he becomes integrated into their inner circle.

The record label hires Dennis, a professional manager, to handle problems with venues and promoters. Penny has to leave before the band reaches New York, where Russell's girlfriend Leslie will join them. Penny and her three protégée band aids are gambled away to another band in a poker game; Penny acts nonchalantly but is devastated. Meanwhile, Dennis charters a small plane so the band can play more gigs.

Penny shows up uninvited at the New York restaurant where they are celebrating the news that they are to be featured on the cover of ''Rolling Stone''. Penny is asked to leave after her attempts to get Russell's attention are noticed. William chases her to her hotel, where he saves her from overdosing on [[methaqualone|quaaludes]].

Flying to a gig the following day, the plane encounters severe weather. Fearing the plane will crash, everyone confesses their secrets, while Jeff and Russell's long-simmering conflicts erupt. William confesses his love for Penny after Jeff insults her. The plane lands safely in [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]], leaving everyone to ponder the changed atmosphere.

William arrives at the ''Rolling Stone'' office in San Francisco but has difficulty finishing the article. Seeking help, he calls Lester Bangs who says William got caught up in being part of the band. He says his perceived friendships with them are not real and advises him to ""be honest... and unmerciful."" ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s editors rave over William's completed article, but Russell lies to the magazine's fact-checker, claiming most of it is false. ''Rolling Stone'' kills the article, crushing William. Anita encounters William in the airport and offers to take him anywhere; he chooses for them to go to San Diego, where their mother Elaine is glad to see them both.

Sapphire, one of the protégée ""Band Aids"", chastises Russell for betraying William. He then calls Penny, wanting to meet with her, but she tricks him by giving him William's address instead of her own. He arrives and finds himself face to face with William's mother who, during the tour, scolded him over the phone for his behavior. He apologizes to William and finally gives him an interview. Russell verifies the article to ''Rolling Stone'', which runs it as a cover feature. Penny fulfills her long-standing fantasy to go to [[Morocco]] while Stillwater tours again by bus.

518,Boogie Nights,"==Plot==
In 1977, high-school dropout Eddie Adams is living with his father and emotionally and physically abusive mother in [[Torrance, California]]. He works at a [[Reseda, Los Angeles|Reseda]] nightclub owned by Maurice Rodriguez, where he meets [[Pornographic film|porn filmmaker]] Jack Horner. Interested in bringing Eddie into porn, Jack auditions him by watching him have sex with Rollergirl, a porn starlet who always wears [[Roller skates|skates]].

After a fight with his mother, Eddie moves in with Jack at his [[San Fernando Valley]] home. He gives himself the [[Stage name|screen name]] ""Dirk Diggler"" and becomes a star because of his good looks, youthful charisma, and abnormally large penis. His success allows him to buy a new house, an extensive wardrobe, and a ""competition orange"" [[Chevrolet Corvette (C3)#1975–1977|1977 Chevrolet Corvette]]. With his friend and co-star Reed Rothchild, Dirk pitches a series of successful [[action fiction|action]]-themed porn films. He works and socializes with others from the porn industry, and they live carefree lifestyles in the late 1970s [[disco]] era. While attending a [[New Year's Eve]] party at Horner's house on December 31, 1979, assistant director Little Bill discovers his adulterous wife having sex with another man. Bill, tired of being repeatedly cheated on, shoots the pair dead and commits suicide.

Dirk and Reed begin using [[cocaine]] on a regular basis. Due to his drug use, Dirk finds it increasingly [[Erectile dysfunction|difficult to achieve an erection]], falls into violent mood swings, and becomes irritated with Johnny Doe, a rival leading man Jack has recently recruited, and whom Dirk worries will replace him. In 1983, after arguing with Jack, Dirk is fired and takes off with Reed to start a music career along with Scotty, a [[Boom operator (media)|boom operator]] who is in love with Dirk. Jack rejects business overtures from Floyd Gondolli, a local theater magnate who insists on cutting costs by shooting on [[videotape]] rather than [[film stock]], because Jack believes that video will diminish the quality of his films.

After his friend and financier, Colonel James, is incarcerated for possession of [[child pornography]], Jack cooperates with Gondolli but becomes disillusioned with the work he is expected to churn out. One of these projects involves Jack and Rollergirl riding in a limousine, searching for random men for her to have sex with while being taped by a crew. One man recognizes Rollergirl as a former high-school classmate, and after a failed attempt at intercourse, he insults her and Jack. Both Jack and Rollergirl attack the man, leaving him bloodied on the sidewalk.

Leading lady Amber Waves lands in a [[Child custody|custody battle]] with her ex-husband. The court determines that she is an unfit mother due to her involvement in the porn industry, criminal record, and cocaine addiction. Buck Swope marries fellow porn star Jessie St. Vincent, who becomes pregnant. Because of his past as a pornographer, Buck is disqualified from a bank loan and cannot open his own stereo equipment store. That night, he finds himself in the middle of a holdup at a donut shop in which the clerk, the robber, and an armed customer are killed. Buck is the sole survivor and escapes with the money.

Having spent most of their money on drugs, Dirk and Reed are unable to pay a recording studio for demo tapes they believe will enable them to become music stars. Desperate for money, Dirk resorts to [[male prostitution|prostitution]] but is assaulted and robbed by three men. Dirk, Reed, and their friend Todd Parker attempt to scam local drug dealer Rahad Jackson at his estate by selling him a half-kilo of baking soda disguised as cocaine. Dirk and Reed intend to leave quickly before Rahad's bodyguard inspects it, but a drugged-up and armed Todd attempts to steal more money, as well as some more drugs, from Rahad. In the ensuing gunfight, Todd kills Rahad's bodyguard and is killed by Rahad, while Dirk and Reed narrowly escape. Dirk returns to Jack's home and they reconcile.

In 1984, Amber shoots the television commercial for the opening of Buck's store, Rollergirl takes a [[General Educational Development|GED]] class, Maurice opens a nightclub with his brothers, Reed performs magic acts at a [[strip club]], and Jessie gives birth to her and Buck's son.

521,True Romance,"==Plot==
At a [[Detroit]] theater showing [[kung fu film]]s, Alabama Whitman strikes up a conversation with [[Elvis Presley]] fanatic Clarence Worley. They later have sex at his [[Downtown Detroit|downtown]] apartment. Alabama tearfully confesses that she is a [[call girl]] hired by Clarence's boss as a birthday present but has fallen in love with him. The two get married the next day at City Hall. An apparition of Elvis visits Clarence and convinces him to kill Alabama's abusive [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], Drexl Spivey. Going to the brothel where Alabama worked, he shoots and kills Drexl and takes a bag he assumes contains Alabama's belongings. Back at the apartment, he and Alabama discover it contains a large amount of [[cocaine]] that Drexl had stolen from two drug pushers.

The couple visits Clarence's estranged father Clifford, a retired cop, for help. He tells Clarence the police assume Drexl's murder is a gang killing committed in revenge for the murdered dealers. After the couple leave for [[Los Angeles]], Clifford is interrogated by Vincenzo Coccotti, ''[[consigliere]]'' to mobster ""Blue Lou Boyle"", who had hired Drexl to steal and distribute the cocaine on his behalf. He reveals that the mob knows about Clarence's theft since they found his driver's license near Drexl's body. Clifford, realizing he will die anyway, mockingly defies Coccotti, who shoots him dead. One of his men then finds a Los Angeles address taped to Clifford's refrigerator.

In Los Angeles, Clarence and Alabama meet Clarence's aspiring actor friend, Dick Ritchie, who introduces him to actor and production assistant Elliot Blitzer. He reluctantly agrees to broker the sale of the drugs to his boss, [[film producer]] Lee Donowitz. While Clarence is out buying lunch, Coccotti's enforcer Virgil finds Alabama in her motel room and beats her for information. Alabama fights back, stabbing him with a corkscrew, putting nail polish remover in his eyes and using hairspray to set fire to Virgil's face before grabbing his [[sawed-off shotgun]], and shooting him to death in a maniacal rage. Clarence tends to Alabama's wounds, and they discuss their future together.

Elliot is pulled over for speeding and gets charged when his mistress hits him with a bag of cocaine and spills it on him. To stay out of jail, he agrees to wear a wire and record the drug deal between Clarence and Donowitz for police detectives Dimes and Nicholson. Coccotti's men also learn about where the deal will take place from Dick's stoner roommate Floyd. Clarence, Alabama, Dick, and Elliot go to Donowitz's suite at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] with the drugs. In the elevator, a suspicious Clarence threatens Elliot at gunpoint but is persuaded by Elliot's pleading for mercy.

Clarence fabricates a story for Donowitz that the drugs were given to him by a corrupt cop, and he agrees to the sale. Excusing himself to the bathroom, the vision of Elvis reassures him that things are going well. Donowitz and his bodyguards are ambushed by the cops and the mobsters. Elliot reveals himself to be an informant by asking the cops if he could leave, whereupon a shootout erupts. Dick throws the suitcase of drugs into the air, where it gets shredded by gunfire, and flees. Donowitz, his bodyguards, Elliot, the cops, and the mobsters are all killed, and Clarence is wounded as he exits the bathroom. He and Alabama escape with Donowitz's money as more police arrive. They flee to Mexico, where Alabama gives birth to a son, whom they name Elvis.","Crime, Drama, Romance","starring       = {{Plainlist|

524,Carlito's Way,"==Plot==
In 1975 [[New York City]], after having served five years of a thirty-year prison sentence, career criminal Carlito Brigante is freed on a legal technicality that has been exploited by his close friend and lawyer Dave Kleinfeld. Carlito vows to end his unlawful activities but is persuaded to accompany his young cousin Guajiro to a drug deal at an illegal [[speakeasy]]. Guajiro's suppliers betray and kill him, forcing Carlito to shoot his way out. Carlito takes Guajiro's $30,000 from the botched deal and uses it to buy a stake in a [[nightclub]] that is owned by a gambling addict named Saso, intending to save $75,000 to retire to the [[Caribbean]].

Carlito declines several offers for a business partnership with a hot-headed young gangster from [[the Bronx]] named Benny Blanco. Carlito also rekindles his romance with his former girlfriend Gail, a ballet dancer who moonlights as a stripper. Dave develops a love interest with Benny's girlfriend Steffie, a waitress at the club. Benny's frustration with Carlito's rejections comes to a head, and he confronts Carlito at his table. Carlito publicly humiliates Benny, who reacts by manhandling Steffie. Fueled by his now-extensive use of [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[cocaine]], Dave brazenly pulls out a gun and threatens to kill Benny, but Carlito intervenes. Despite being personally threatened by Benny, Carlito lets him go unharmed, a decision that alienates him from his friend and bodyguard Pachanga.

Dave, who stole $1 million in a payoff from his client, [[American Mafia|Mafia]] boss Anthony ""Tony T"" Taglialucci, is coerced into providing his [[yacht]] to help Taglialucci break out of the [[Vernon C. Bain Correctional Center|Rikers Island prison barge]]. Dave begs for Carlito's assistance in the prison break, and Carlito reluctantly agrees. That night, Carlito, Dave and Taglialucci's son Frankie sail to a floating [[buoy]] outside of the barge where Taglialucci is waiting. As they pull Taglialucci aboard, Dave impulsively kills him, and Frankie and dumps their bodies in the [[East River]], claiming that they would have killed him anyway. Knowing that mob retaliation is imminent, Carlito immediately severs his ties with Dave and decides to leave town with Gail. The next day, Dave is hospitalized after a mob hitman stabs him several times.

The police apprehend Carlito and take him to the office of District Attorney Norwalk, where he learns that Dave has already agreed to [[perjury|perjure]] himself should Carlito be tried again. Despite being threatened with charges of being an accomplice to the Taglialucci murders, Carlito refuses to betray Dave. In the hospital, Carlito visits Dave, who confesses to selling him out. Having noticed a suspicious man dressed in a police uniform waiting in the lobby, Carlito secretly unloads Dave's revolver and leaves. The man is Taglialucci's other son Vinnie seeking vengeance for his brother and father. After sending away the officer who is guarding Dave, Vinnie enters Dave's room and shoots him dead.

Carlito buys train tickets to [[Miami]] for himself and Gail, now pregnant. When he visits his club to get the stashed money, he is met by a [[East Harlem Purple Gang|group of East Harlem Italian gangsters]] led by Vinnie. The Italians plan to kill Carlito, but he manages to slip out through a secret exit. The Italians pursue him through the city's subway system and into [[Grand Central Terminal]], where they engage in a gunfight.

Carlito kills all of his pursuers except Vinnie, who the police shoot and kill. As Carlito runs to catch the train where Gail and Pachanga are waiting for him, Benny ambushes him and fatally shoots him several times with a [[suppressor|silenced gun]]. Pachanga admits to Carlito that he is now working for Benny, but Benny shoots him dead as well. Carlito hands a tearful Gail the money and tells her to escape with their unborn child and start a new life. As he dies, Carlito stares at a billboard with a Caribbean beach and a picture of a woman. The billboard comes to life in his mind, and the woman, now Gail, starts dancing.","Crime, Drama, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist|

525,Edward Scissorhands,"==Plot==
One snowy evening, an elderly woman tells her granddaughter the bedtime story of a young man named Edward, who has scissor blades for hands.

Many years earlier, Peg Boggs, a local door-to-door [[Avon Products|Avon]] saleswoman, tries to sell at the decrepit [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] mansion where Edward lives. The creation of an old inventor, Edward is an ageless humanoid. The inventor homeschooled Edward but died from a heart attack before giving Edward hands, leaving him unfinished. Peg finds Edward alone and offers to take him to her home after discovering he is virtually harmless. Peg introduces Edward to her husband Bill, their young son Kevin, and their teenage daughter Kim. Edward falls in love with Kim, despite her initial fear of him. As their neighbors are curious about the new houseguest, the Boggs throw a neighborhood barbecue welcoming him. Most of the neighbors are fascinated by Edward and befriend him, except for the eccentric [[Religious fanaticism|religious fanatic]] Esmeralda and Kim's supercilious boyfriend Jim.

Edward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into [[Topiary|topiaries]], progressing to grooming dogs and later styling the hair of the neighborhood women. One of the neighbors, Joyce, offers to help Edward open a hair salon so he can support himself. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce him, but scares him away. Joyce lies to the neighborhood women that Edward forced himself on her, wrecking their trust in him. Edward's dream of opening the salon is ruined when the bank refuses him a loan on the grounds that he has no assessment and collateral and is not legally a human.

Jealous of Kim's attraction to Edward, Jim takes advantage of his naivety by asking him to pick the lock on his parents' home so he can steal his father's electronic goods and sell them to buy a van. Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock, a burglar alarm is triggered. Jim flees and Edward is arrested. The police determine that a lifetime of isolation has left Edward without any common sense or morality; thus, he cannot be criminally charged. Edward nevertheless takes responsibility for the robbery, telling Kim that he did it because she asked him to. Consequently, he is shunned by the entire neighborhood except for the Boggs family.

At [[Christmas]], Edward carves an angelic ice sculpture modeled after Kim; the ice shavings are thrown into the air and fall like snow, something that has never happened before in the town. Kim dances in the snowfall. Jim arrives suddenly, calling out to Edward, surprising him and causing him to accidentally cut Kim's hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming her, but Kim, disgusted and fed up with Jim's jealous behavior towards Edward, breaks up with him. Meanwhile, Edward flees in a rage, destroying his works and scaring Esmeralda until he is calmed by a wandering dog.

Kim's parents go out to find Edward while she stays behind in case he returns. Edward returns, finding Kim there. She asks him to hold her, but Edward hesitates, afraid of hurting her. Jim's drunken friend drives him to Kim's house and nearly runs over Kevin, but Edward pushes Kevin to safety while inadvertently cutting him. Witnesses accuse Edward of attacking Kevin; when Jim assaults him, Edward defends himself and injures Jim's arm before fleeing back to the inventor's mansion.

Kim goes to find Edward. Jim obtains a gun, follows her, and shoots at Edward before grabbing a fire poker and beating him. Edward refuses to fight back until he sees Jim strike Kim as she attempts to intervene. Enraged, Edward stabs Jim in the stomach and pushes him from a window of the mansion to his death. Kim confesses her love to Edward and kisses him as they accept that their love can never be fulfilled. As the neighbors gather, Kim convinces them that Jim and Edward killed each other.

The elderly woman, revealed to be Kim, finishes telling her granddaughter the story and says that she never saw Edward again, hoping that by staying away Edward would remember her as she was in her youth. She believes he is still alive because it would not be snowing without him. Edward is then seen carving ice sculptures of his experiences with Kim, with the bits of ice floating as snow in the wind.","Drama, Fantasy, Romance","starring       = {{plainlist|<!--Per poster billing-->

527,Crimes and Misdemeanors,"==Plot==
The story follows two main characters: Judah Rosenthal, a successful and reputable [[ophthalmologist]], and Clifford Stern, a small-time [[documentary film]]maker.

Judah, an [[upper class]] respected family man, is having an affair with [[flight attendant]] Dolores Paley. After it becomes clear to her that Judah will not end his marriage, Dolores threatens to disclose the affair to Judah's wife, Miriam. She is also aware of some questionable financial deals Judah made before becoming a wealthy ophthalmologist, which adds to his stress. He confides in a patient, Ben, a [[rabbi]] who is rapidly losing his eyesight. Ben advises openness and honesty between Judah and his wife, but Judah does not wish to imperil his marriage. Desperate, Judah turns to his brother, Jack, a gangster, who hires a [[Contract killing|hitman]] to kill Dolores. Before her corpse is discovered, Judah retrieves letters and other items from her apartment in order to cover his tracks. Stricken with guilt, Judah turns to the religious teachings he had rejected, believing for the first time that a just [[God]] is watching him and passing judgment.

Cliff, meanwhile, has been hired by his pompous brother-in-law, Lester, a successful television producer, to make a documentary celebrating Lester's life and work. Cliff grows to despise him. While filming and mocking the subject, Cliff falls in love with Lester's associate producer, Halley Reed. Despondent over his failing marriage to Lester's sister Wendy, he woos Halley, showing her footage from his ongoing documentary about Professor Louis Levy, a renowned philosopher. He ensures Halley is aware that he is shooting Lester's documentary merely for the money so he can finish his more meaningful project with Levy.

Cliff learns that Professor Levy, whom he had been profiling for a documentary centered on his philosophical views and the strength of his celebration of life, has committed suicide, leaving a curt note that only says: ""I've gone out the window"". When Halley visits to comfort him, he makes a pass at her, which she gently rebuffs, telling him she is not ready for another romance. Cliff's dislike for Lester becomes evident during the first screening of the film. Cliff has maliciously edited the film, which juxtaposes footage of Lester with clownish poses of [[Benito Mussolini]] addressing a throng of supporters from a balcony. It also shows Lester yelling at his employees and clumsily making a pass at an attractive young actress. Lester fires him.

Adding to Cliff's burdens, Halley leaves for [[London]], where Lester is offering her a producing job; when she returns several months later, Cliff is astounded to discover that she and Lester are engaged. Hearing that Lester sent Halley white roses ""round the clock, for days"" while they were in London, Cliff is crestfallen as Halley falling for Lester is his “worst fear realized.”<ref name="":0"" /> His last romantic gesture to Halley had been a love letter which he had mostly [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] from [[James Joyce]], including references to [[Dublin]].

Judah and Cliff meet by happenstance at the wedding of the daughter of Rabbi Ben, who is Cliff's brother-in-law and Judah's patient. Judah has worked through his guilt and is enjoying life once more; the murder had been blamed on a drifter with a criminal record. He draws Cliff into a supposedly hypothetical discussion that draws upon his moral quandary. Judah says that with time, any crisis will pass; but Cliff morosely claims that “very few guys could live with that on their conscience.”<ref name="":0"">{{Cite web |title=Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) Movie Scripts {{!}} SQ |url=https://stockq.org/moviescript/C/crimes-and-misdemeanors.php |access-date=2023-03-09 |website=stockq.org}}</ref> Judah cheerfully leaves the wedding party with his wife, and Cliff is left sitting alone, dejected.

The wedding party continues. Rabbi Ben, who is now blind, shares a dance with his daughter while the voice of Professor Levy is heard, saying that the universe is a dark and indifferent place which human beings fill with love, in the hope that “future generations will understand more.”<ref name="":0"" />","Comedy, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|

529,Hannah and Her Sisters,"==Plot==
The story is told in three main [[Story arc|arc]]s, with most of it occurring during a 24-month period beginning and ending at Thanksgiving parties, held at [[The Langham (apartment building)|The Langham]], hosted by Hannah, and her husband, Elliot.  Hannah serves as the stalwart hub of the narrative; most of the events of the film connect to her.

Elliot becomes infatuated with one of Hannah's sisters, Lee, and eventually begins an affair with her.  Elliot attributes his behavior to his discontent with his wife's self-sufficiency and resentment of her emotional strength.  Lee has lived for five years with a reclusive artist, Frederick, who is much older.  She finds her relationship with Frederick no longer intellectually or sexually stimulating, in spite of (or maybe because of) Frederick's professed interest in continuing to teach her.  She leaves Frederick after admitting to having a dalliance with Elliot.  For the remainder of the year between the first and second Thanksgiving gatherings, Elliot and Lee carry on their affair despite Elliot's inability to end his marriage to Hannah.  Lee finally ends the affair during the second Thanksgiving, explaining that she is finished waiting for him to commit and that she has started dating someone else.

Hannah's ex-husband Mickey, a television writer, is present mostly in scenes outside of the primary story.  Flashbacks reveal that his marriage to Hannah fell apart after they were unable to have children because of his infertility.  However, they had twins who are not biologically his, before divorcing.  He also went on a disastrous date with Hannah's sister Holly, when they were set up after the divorce.  A hypochondriac, he goes to his doctor complaining of hearing loss, and is frightened by the possibility that it might be a brain tumor.  When tests prove that he is perfectly healthy, he is initially overjoyed, but then despairs that his life is meaningless.  His [[existential crisis]] leads to unsatisfying experiments with [[religious conversion]] to [[Catholicism]] and an interest in [[Krishna Consciousness]].  Ultimately, a suicide attempt leads him to find meaning in his life after unexpectedly viewing the [[Marx Brothers]]' ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' in a movie theater.  The revelation that life should be enjoyed, rather than understood, helps to prepare him for a second date with Holly, which this time blossoms into love.

Holly's story is the film's third main arc.  A former cocaine addict, she is an unsuccessful actress who cannot settle on a career.  After borrowing money from Hannah, she starts a catering business with April, a friend and fellow actress.  Holly and April end up as rivals in auditions for parts in Broadway musicals, as well as for the affections of an architect, David.  Holly abandons the catering business after the romance with David fails and decides to try her hand at writing.  The career change forces her once again to borrow money from Hannah, a dependency that Holly resents.  She writes a script inspired by Hannah and Elliot, which greatly upsets Hannah.  It is suggested that much of the script involved personal details of Hannah and Elliot's marriage that had been conveyed to Holly through Lee (having been transmitted first from Elliot).  Although this threatens to expose the affair between Elliot and Lee, Elliot soon disavows disclosing any such details.  Holly sets aside her script, and instead writes a story inspired by her own life, which Mickey reads and admires greatly, vowing to help her get it produced and leading to their second date.

A minor arc in the film tells part of the story of Norma and Evan.  They are the parents of Hannah and her two sisters, and still have acting careers of their own.  Their own tumultuous marriage revolves around Norma's alcoholism and alleged affairs, but the long-term bond between them is evident in Evan's flirtatious anecdotes about Norma while playing piano at the Thanksgiving gatherings.

By the time of the film's third Thanksgiving, Lee has married a literature professor she met while taking random classes at [[Columbia University]]. Hannah and Elliot have reconciled their marriage.  The film's final shot reveals that Holly is married to Mickey and that she is pregnant.","Comedy, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|

531,This Is Spinal Tap,"==Plot==
Filmmaker Martin ""Marty"" Di Bergi is filming a documentary about English rock band [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]'s 1982 United States [[concert tour]] to promote their new album, ''Smell the Glove''. The band comprises childhood friends David St. Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel on vocals and guitar, bassist Derek Smalls, keyboardist Viv Savage, and drummer Mick Shrimpton.

The documentary shows Spinal Tap's early days as the [[skiffle]] group The Originals; they renamed themselves the New Originals when it was discovered another band was already called The Originals, only to change it back when the original Originals broke up. They later had a hit as the Thamesmen, ""Gimme Some Money,"" before changing their name to Spinal Tap and achieving a significant hit with the [[flower power]] anthem ""Listen to the Flower People""; they subsequently began performing [[heavy metal music]]. Several of the band's previous drummers died under strange circumstances: John ""Stumpy"" Pepys died in a ""bizarre gardening accident"" that police said was better left unsolved, Eric ""Stumpy Joe"" Childs died choking on someone else's vomit, and Peter ""James"" Bond [[spontaneous human combustion|exploded on stage]]. Nigel shows Marty his extensive guitar collection, as well as a custom-made [[amplifier]] that has volume knobs that go [[up to eleven]]; Nigel believes this makes the amplifier ""one louder"" than most other amplifiers, which have ""ten"" as the highest volume setting.

[[File:Spinal_Tap_-_Up_to_Eleven.jpg|thumb|left|Nigel's amplifier dials that have ""eleven"" as the highest volume setting. This scene is the origin of the phrase [[up to eleven]].]]
Tensions rise between the band and their manager, Ian Faith, as several shows are canceled due to low ticket sales, and major retailers refuse to sell ''Smell the Glove'' because of its sexist cover art. David's girlfriend Jeanine, a [[yoga as exercise|yoga]] and [[astrology]] devotee, joins the group on tour and participates in band meetings. Nigel and Ian dislike Jeanine's ideas for Spinal Tap's costumes and stage presentation. Without consulting Spinal Tap, the band's record label releases ''Smell the Glove'' with an entirely black album cover. Despite Ian's assertion that it could have a similar appeal to [[the Beatles]]' [[The Beatles (album)|White Album]], ''Smell the Glove'' fails to sell.

Nigel suggests staging a lavish, Druid-themed [[glam rock]] show and asks Ian to order a [[Stonehenge]] [[trilithon]]. However, Nigel mislabels its dimensions, and the resulting prop is only {{convert|18|in|cm}} high rather than {{convert|18|ft|m}}, making the group a laughingstock. The group blames Ian, and when David suggests Jeanine should co-manage the group, Ian quits. The tour continues, rescheduled for much smaller venues, and Jeanine and David increasingly marginalize Nigel. At a gig at a [[United States Air Force]] base, Nigel is upset by an equipment malfunction and quits mid-performance. At their next gig, in an amphitheater at an amusement park where the band is billed below a puppet show, the band finds their repertoire is severely limited without Nigel. At Derek's suggestion, the band improvises an experimental ""Jazz Odyssey,"" which is poorly received.

On the last day of the tour, David and Derek consider ending Spinal Tap and exploring other projects, such as a musical about [[Jack the Ripper]] called ''Saucy Jack''. Before they go on stage, Nigel arrives and tells them that Spinal Tap's song ""Sex Farm"" has become [[Big in Japan (phrase)|a major hit in Japan]] and that Ian wants to arrange a tour there. David bitterly refuses, but later, as Nigel watches the band performing from the wings, David relents and invites Nigel to join the band onstage, delighting the crowd but infuriating Jeanine. During the performance, Mick explodes on stage. Ian is rehired as the group's manager, and Spinal Tap (now with Joe ""Mama"" Besser as their drummer) performs a series of sold-out shows in Japan.","Comedy, Music","starring       = {{Plain list|

[[File:Christmas Story House.jpg|thumb|The front of the Parkers' house where ''A Christmas Story'' was filmed in the Tremont neighborhood of Cleveland's west side. The building was restored and reconfigured inside to match the soundstage interiors and is open to the public as [[A Christmas Story House]].]]

The film is presented in a series of [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]], with narration provided by the adult Ralphie Parker. As a 9-year-old boy in 1940, all Ralphie wants for Christmas is a [[Daisy Outdoor Products#Red Ryder BB Gun|Red Ryder Carbine Action 200-shot Range Model air rifle]]. Ralphie's desire is continuously rejected, first by his mother, who tells him ""You'll shoot your eye out"". He is later assigned a theme for school about what he wants for Christmas, and he writes about the BB gun. However, he gets it back with a poor grade, and the same warning. Finally, on Christmas Eve, Ralphie sees a disgruntled Santa at Higbee's Department Store, and he expresses his desire, only to be hurriedly brushed off with the same warning.

On Christmas morning, Ralphie receives some presents that he enjoys but is disappointed not to find the rifle among them. Ralphie's father (""The Old Man"") directs him to one last box hidden in the corner, which proves to contain the rifle. Ralphie eagerly hurries outside to try it out, but when he shoots at the metal target he has set up, the BB [[ricochet]]s and knocks off his glasses. Ralphie accidentally steps on and breaks the glasses while trying to find them; he makes up a cover story about an [[icicle]] falling from the roof of the garage and hitting his eye, which fools his mom and keeps him from getting in trouble. 

That night, Ralphie goes to sleep with the gun by his side, as his adult self reflects that it was the best Christmas present he had ever received or would ever receive.

===Other vignettes===
Interspersed with the main story are several loosely related vignettes involving the Parkers:

* The Old Man fights a never-ending battle with the malfunctioning furnace in the Parker home. His frustrations cause him to swear profusely (heard as gibberish in the film), leading Ralphie to suspect a cloud of profanity ""is still hanging in space over [[Lake Michigan]]"".<ref>{{cite web |title=Trivia – ''A Christmas Story'' House |publisher=Turner Entertainment Co. |url=http://www.achristmasstoryhouse.com/index.php/a-christmas-story-movie-facts/ |access-date=December 25, 2012}}</ref> 
* Ralphie's friends, Flick and Schwartz, argue about whether or not a tongue will stick to metal in the winter. Schwartz ""triple-dog dare""s Flick to try sticking his tongue to the schoolyard flagpole, and Flick does indeed get stuck, requiring the [[fire department]]'s help to get him unstuck. Miss Shields makes it clear she knows what happened, but as Flick has refused to give names, she simply gives Ralphie and Schwartz an indirect telling off, and drops the matter without any further discussion.
* The Old Man is delighted when he wins a ""major award"" in a newspaper contest – a table lamp in the shape of a woman's leg wearing a [[fishnet stocking]]. Mrs. Parker dislikes it, and the ensuing ""Battle of the Lamp"" ends with her ""accidentally"" breaking it, much to the Old Man's fury. Unable to fix it, the Old Man quietly buries it in the backyard.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shepherd |first=Jean |title=In God We Trust All Others Pay Cash |year=1966 |type=Mass Market Paperback |publisher=Bantam Books |chapter=My Old Man And The Lascivious Special Award That Heralded the Birth Of Pop Art |page=63}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flicklives.com/index.php?pg=272|title=flicklives.com|website=www.flicklives.com}}</ref>
* Ralphie eagerly checks the mail each day for a [[secret decoder ring]], which he earned through a promotion [[Ovaltine]] and the ''[[Little Orphan Annie (radio series)|Little Orphan Annie]]'' radio show were running. However, when the ring finally arrives, and Ralphie decodes the secret message broadcast on the radio show, he is disappointed to find the message is merely an Ovaltine ad: ''""Be sure to drink your Ovaltine""''.
* While unsuccessfully helping The Old Man change a blown tire, Ralphie accidentally drops an f-bomb, and gets his mouth washed out with [[Lifebuoy (soap)|Lifebuoy soap]] as a punishment. When his mother demands to know where he heard it, (although it's obvious Ralphie heard it frequently from the Old Man), Ralphie blames Schwartz. That night, he fantasizes about making his parents sorry, by becoming blind from soap poisoning.
* Ralphie, his brother Randy, and Flick and Schwartz are tormented by the neighborhood bullies Scut Farkus and Grover Dill. Ralphie eventually snaps and attacks Farkus, unleashing a stream of vulgar gibberish similar to the Old Man's.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.achristmasstoryhouse.com/index.php/a-christmas-story-movie-facts/ | title=Movie Facts & Trivia: ''A Christmas Story'' | work=achristmasstoryhouse.com | access-date=April 18, 2014}}</ref> Mrs. Parker halts him mid-fight and escorts him home; Ralphie and Randy expect The Old Man to ""kill"" Ralphie when he finds out, but, while Mrs. Parker casually mentions the fight, she manages to distract The Old Man by talking about a [[American football|football]] game, earning Ralphie's respect. 
* Ralphie is dismayed to receive an embarrassing pink bunny [[blanket sleeper|footed sleeper]] from his infantilizing Aunt Clara. Mrs. Parker forces him to try it on and thinks it’s adorable, but The Old Man calls it ""a pink nightmare"" and allows Ralphie to take it off. Mrs. Parker agrees to only have Ralphie wear it when Aunt Clara visits.
* The Old Man is frequently chased by a pack of ""at least 785 smelly [[bloodhounds|hound dogs]]"" owned by the Bumpus family, the Parkers' [[hillbilly]] neighbors. On Christmas Day, the dogs ruin the Parkers' dinner by romping through their kitchen and eating their turkey, forcing the family to go to a [[Chinese restaurant]] to eat, where they enjoy an entertaining dinner of [[Peking Duck|""Chinese Turkey""]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefw.com/things-you-didnt-know-about-a-christmas-story/|title=10 Things You Didn't Know About ''A Christmas Story''|access-date=December 25, 2015|work=thefw.com|author=TheFW Staff|date=December 10, 2013 }}</ref>","Comedy, Family","starring       = {{plainlist|

School under Fascism is a tedious cavalcade of dry facts recited by instructors of varying levels of engagement and skill. All Titta and his fellow students can do is goof off or skip class when not called upon to solve math problems or identify obscure historical details. When Titta goes to confession, he manages to avoid telling Don Balosa about his masturbatory activities and attempt to seduce Gradisca, a glamorous older woman, because the priest is more concerned with floral arrangements.

Fascist officials come for a tour, and the schoolchildren are required to perform athletic routines for their approval. Titta's friend Ciccio daydreams about being married to his crush, Aldina, by the giant face of Mussolini. Surreptitiously wired into the bell tower of the town church, a gramophone plays a recording of ""[[The Internationale]]"", but it is soon shot at and destroyed by gun-crazy Fascists. Owing to his anarchist past, Titta's father Aurelio is brought in for questioning and forced to drink [[castor oil]]. He limps home in a nauseous state to be washed by his wife, Miranda.

One summer afternoon, the family visits Uncle Teo, Aurelio's brother, confined to an insane asylum. They take him out for a day in the country, but he escapes into a tree, repeatedly yelling, ""''Voglio una donna!''"" (""I want a woman!""). All attempts to bring him down are met with stones that Teo carries in his pockets. A dwarf nun and two orderlies finally arrive on the scene. Marching up the ladder, the nun reprimands Teo, who obediently agrees to return to the asylum.

Fall arrives. The town's inhabitants embark in small boats to meet the passage of the [[SS Rex|SS ''Rex'']], the regime's proudest technological achievement. By midnight they have fallen asleep waiting for its arrival. Awakened by a foghorn, they watch in awe as the liner sails past, capsizing their boats in its wake. Titta's grandfather wanders lost in a disorienting fog so thick it seems to smother the house and the autumnal landscape. Walking out to the town's Grand Hotel, Titta and his friends find it boarded up. Like zombies, they waltz on the terrace with imaginary female partners enveloped in the fog.

The annual car race provides the occasion for Titta to daydream of winning the grand prize, Gradisca. One evening he visits the buxom tobacconist at closing time. She becomes aroused when he demonstrates he is strong enough to lift her, but is annoyed when he becomes overwhelmed as she presses her breasts into his face. She gives him a cigarette then coldly sends him home.

Winter brings with it record snowfall. Miranda nurses a sick Titta to health, then as spring arrives again, dies of an illness herself. Titta is devastated. Later, the village attends the reception for Gradisca's marriage to a Fascist officer. As Gradisca drives off with her ''[[Carabinieri|Carabiniere]]'', someone notices that Titta has gone too.","Comedy, Drama, Family","starring       = {{Plainlist|

542,Harold and Maude,"==Plot==
Harold Chasen is a young man [[Fascination with death|obsessed with death]]. He stages elaborate [[Faked death|fake suicides]], attends funerals (usually for people that he does not know), and drives a [[hearse]], all to the chagrin of his self-obsessed, wealthy socialite mother. His mother sends Harold to a [[psychoanalyst]], sets him up with blind dates, and buys him a [[luxury car]], all schemes he subverts in his own way.

Harold meets 79-year-old Maude one day while at a random stranger's [[Requiem|funeral Mass]], and discovers that they share a hobby. Harold is entranced by Maude's quirky outlook on life, which is bright and delightfully carefree in contrast to his morbid demeanor. Maude lives in a decommissioned [[railroad car]] and thinks nothing of breaking the law; she is quite skilled at [[Motor vehicle theft|stealing cars]] and will swiftly uproot an ailing tree in a city sidewalk to replant it in the forest. She and Harold form a bond and Maude shows Harold the pleasures of art and music (including how to play the [[banjo]]), and teaches him how to make ""the most of his time on earth.""

Meanwhile, Harold's mother is determined, against Harold's wishes, to [[Arranged marriage|find him a wife]]. One by one, Harold frightens and horrifies each of his appointed [[Computer dating|computer dates]], by appearing to commit gruesome acts, including [[self-immolation]], [[self-mutilation]], and ''[[seppuku]]''. His mother attempts to enlist him in the military by sending Harold to his uncle, who lost an arm serving under [[General MacArthur]] in [[World War II]], but Harold deters the recruitment by staging a scene where Maude poses as a [[Pacifism|pacifist protester]] and Harold seemingly murders her out of militarist [[fanaticism]].

As Harold and Maude grow closer, their friendship blossoms into a romance. Holding her hand, Harold discovers a number tattooed on her forearm, indicating Maude survived the [[Nazi death camp]]s. Harold announces that he will marry Maude, resulting in disgusted outbursts from his family, analyst, and priest. Unbeknownst to Harold, Maude has been planning to end her own life on her 80th birthday. Maude's birthday arrives, and Harold throws a surprise party for her.

544,The Wild Bunch,"==Plot==
In 1913 Texas, Pike Bishop, the leader of a gang of aging outlaws, seeks to retire after a final robbery of silver from a railroad payroll office. Corrupt railroad agent Pat Harrigan has hired a posse of [[bounty hunter]]s led by Pike's former partner Deke Thornton, who ambush and kill more than half of Bishop's gang in a bloody shootout, which also kills many innocent bystanders as Pike uses a serendipitous [[Temperance movement|temperance union]] parade to shield their getaway.

Pike rides off with the only survivors: his close friend Dutch Engstrom, brothers Lyle and Tector Gorch, the inexperienced Angel, and a fifth man blinded and mortally wounded by buckshot, who Pike mercy-kills. The loot from the robbery turns out to be worthless steel [[washer (hardware)|washer]]s planted by Harrigan. Needing money, they head for Mexico accompanied by the cantankerous Freddie Sykes and cross the [[Rio Grande]] to the rural village where Angel was born. The village elder warns them about General Mapache, a vicious [[Victoriano Huerta|Huertista]] officer in the [[Mexican Federal Army]], who has been stealing food and animals from local villages to support his campaign against the forces of [[Pancho Villa]].

Pike's gang ask the general for work at his headquarters in the town of Agua Verde. Angel spots his former lover Teresa in Mapache's arms and shoots her dead, angering the general and nearly getting them killed, but Pike defuses the situation. Mapache offers gold to the gang to rob a [[U.S. Army]] train so Mapache can resupply his army's dwindling stocks of ammunition and provide samples of American weapons to his [[German Empire|German]] military adviser Commander Mohr.

Angel gives his share of the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and ammunition to a band of peasant rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely as planned until Thornton's posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed and chases them to the Mexican border. The robbers blow up a [[trestle bridge]] spanning the Rio Grande as the posse tries to cross, dumping the entire posse into the river, but the exhausted posse continues their pursuit.
[[File:Wild Bunch Agua Verde.jpg|thumb|The director sets up the climactic gun battle sequences at ""Agua Verde"" (the Hacienda Ciénaga del Carmen).]]

Pike, anticipating that Mapache might double-cross him, hides the goods and has his men sell them to Mapache in separate amounts. However, Mapache learns from Teresa's mother that Angel stole some of the weapons and reveals this as Angel and Dutch deliver the last of the weapons. Angel desperately tries to escape, only to be captured and beaten. Mapache lets Dutch go after he states that Angel is a thief who deserves to be punished, and Dutch then tells Pike and the others what happened.

Sykes is wounded by Thornton's posse while securing spare horses. Dutch criticizes Thornton for working with the railroad, but Pike says Thornton ""gave his word"" to the railroad and must see it through. Dutch angrily declares, ""That ain't what counts, it's who you give it to."" Pike and the gang bury most of the gold and return to Agua Verde, where the townspeople and soldiers are drunkenly celebrating the weapons sale and Mapache is dragging Angel through town on a rope tied to the back of his car. Mapache refuses to sell Angel back to the gang, and after a period of reflection while visiting a [[brothel]], Pike and the others arm themselves to rescue their friend by force.

Mapache initially agrees to release Angel, only to cut his throat at the last second. The gang instantly opens fire and guns down the general. While the nearby soldiers are frozen in shock, Pike calmly takes aim and kills Mohr. This begins a bloody gunfight that kills Pike, Dutch, the remaining gang members, Mohr's aide, every member of Mapache's staff, and most of the assembled troops.

Thornton arrives and finds Pike already dead. Thornton finds a loaded revolver on Pike's belt and takes it as a sign that the days of men like him are over. Feeling outdated and tired, Thornton allows the remaining posse members to greedily strip Pike and his men of their possessions before taking them back to Texas for the bounty, while he stays behind. After some time, Sykes arrives with the elder from Angel's village and a band of rebels, indicating that they caught up with the bounty hunters, avenged the gang's deaths, and buried them properly. Sykes invites Thornton to join the coming revolution against the Mexican government. Thornton smiles and rides off with them.","Action, Adventure, Western","starring       = {{Plainlist|

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for film articles should be 400-700 words. -->
Siblings Barbra and Johnny drive to a cemetery in rural [[Pennsylvania]] to visit their father's grave, where a pale man in a tattered suit kills Johnny and attacks Barbra. She flees to a nearby farmhouse but finds the resident's corpse lying half-eaten on the stairs. A growing horde of ghouls soon surround the house as a stranger, Ben, arrives and initially mistakes Barbra for the homeowner. After driving back several ghouls, he boards the windows and doors. While searching the home for supplies, he locates a [[Winchester Model 1894|lever-action rifle]].

A nearly catatonic Barbra is surprised to find people already taking shelter in the home's cellar. Harry, his wife Helen, and their young daughter Karen fled there after a group of the same monsters overturned their car and bit Karen on the arm, leaving her seriously ill. A couple, Tom and Judy, took shelter after hearing an emergency broadcast about a series of brutal killings. Tom and Ben secure the farmhouse while Harry protests that it is unsafe aboveground before returning to the cellar. Ghouls continue to besiege the farmhouse in increasing numbers.

The refugees listen to radio and television reports of an army of cannibalistic corpses committing [[mass murder]] across the [[East Coast of the United States]] and of the [[Posse comitatus|posses]] of armed men patrolling the countryside to exterminate the living dead. Reports confirm that the ghouls can die again from heavy blows to the head, bullets to the brain, or being burned. Various rescue centers offer refuge and safety, and scientists theorize that [[radiation]] from an exploding [[space probe]] returning from [[Venus]] caused the reanimations.

[[File:JudithRidley.jpg|alt=Judy peers from an open truck window.|Judith Ridley as Judy, near the gas pump|thumb|left]]

Ben devises a plan to obtain medical supplies for Karen and transport the group to a rescue center by refueling his truck at a pump on the farm. Ben, Tom, and Judy drive there together, holding the ghouls off with torches and [[Molotov cocktail]]s. However, the gas from the pump spills and causes the truck to catch fire and explode, killing Tom and Judy. Ben returns and breaks down the door when Harry does not let him in.

The remaining survivors attempt to figure a way out. They pause their discussion to watch the 3&nbsp;a.m. news update until the power cuts out. The ghouls soon break through the doors and windows of the unlit home. In the chaos, Harry grabs Ben's gun but is disarmed and shot by Ben. Harry staggers down to the cellar and dies next to his daughter.

Karen dies from her injuries, becomes a ghoul, and eats her father's remains. She stabs her mother to death with a masonry [[trowel]]. Barbra tries to help Ben keep the ghouls out, but a reanimated Johnny drags her away. As the horde breaks in, Ben takes refuge in the cellar, where he shoots Harry's and Helen's ghouls.

In the morning, an armed posse arrives to dispatch the remaining ghouls. Awoken by their gunfire and sirens, Ben emerges from the cellar, but they shoot him, mistaking Ben for a ghoul. His body is thrown onto a bonfire and burned with the rest of the ghouls.","Horror, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist|

552,Hiroshima mon amour,"==Plot==
A series of [[closeup]]s of the backs and arms of a man and woman embracing, amidst falling ash and then covered in sweat. In [[voiceover]], the woman recounts the aftermath of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] that she has seen on her trip to the city, while [[newsreel]] and fictional footage of victims, protests, war memorials, and the streets and buildings of modern [[Hiroshima]] are shown. The man calmly says the woman has not seen anything, nor does she know what it is to forget. He is from Hiroshima and his family died in the bombing while he was off fighting in [[Pacific War|the war]], and the woman is a French actress who is in the city to make an anti-war film.

In the morning, the woman watches the man sleep. His twitching hand reminds her of her first love, a soldier whose hand moved similarly as he lay dying. The Japanese man wakes, and it becomes clear he and the woman met the previous night at a café. She learns he is an architect who is involved in politics. They discuss the bombing and the end of the war, and he is enchanted by the word ""[[Nevers]]"", her hometown, to which she never wants to return. The man says he would like to see the woman again, but she says she is flying back to [[Paris]] the next day. Neither this nor the revelation that she has children change how he feels, but she, though torn, repeatedly declines to arrange another meeting.

The man visits the woman at the [[filming location]], and she is happy to see him. He takes her back to his house. She asks if he lives alone, and he replies that his wife is out of town for a few days. They both say they are happy in their marriages, though they have had casual affairs before, and make love again. After deciding to spend the woman's remaining time in Hiroshima together, they go to a [[tea room]], where the man asks the woman to tell him more about Nevers and her life there. Intercut with flashbacks, she tells how she and an [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|occupying German soldier]] fell in love and planned to elope to [[Bavaria]] before he was shot while waiting for her on the day Nevers was [[Liberation of France|liberated]], how she stayed with him while he died over the next two days, how the villagers shaved her head when they found out about the relationship, and how her parents locked her alternately in her room and the cellar while her hair grew out and she came out of her madness and then sent her away to Paris just before Hiroshima was bombed. She tries to convey the pain she feels about forgetting the German and their love, and indicates she has been trying to keep her distance from the Japanese man because she does not want any more such heartbreak.

The man is elated when he learns the woman never told her husband about the German, but when they leave the tea room, she tells him to go away and that they will probably never see each other again. In her hotel room, she feels guilty about telling the man about the German, but decides to stay in Hiroshima. She goes back to the now-closed tea room, and the man finds her and asks her to stay. She weakly says she will, but then tells him again to go away. They walk around the city, together and separately, images of Hiroshima alternating with images of Nevers. The woman goes to a train station, where she lets go of some of her issues surrounding her first love and decides she might like to visit Nevers. She takes a cab to a nightclub, the man following. The place is nearly empty and they sit apart. As the sun rises, a Japanese man sits by the woman and hits on her in English.

Back in the woman's hotel room, the architect knocks at the door. She lets him in and yells that she is already starting to forget him, but abruptly calms and says his name is ""Hiroshima"". He responds that it is, and her name is ""Nevers"".","Drama, Romance","starring       = {{Plainlist|

556,High Noon,"==Plot==
In Hadleyville, a small town in [[New Mexico Territory]], [[Marshal#State and local marshals|Marshal]] [[Will Kane]], newly married to Amy Fowler, prepares to retire. The happy couple will soon depart to raise a family and run a store in another town. However, word arrives that Frank Miller, a vicious outlaw whom Kane sent to prison, has been released and will arrive by the [[noon]] train, one day ahead of the new marshal. Miller's gang—his younger brother Ben, Jack Colby, and Jim Pierce—wait at the station.

[[File:High Noon1.JPG|thumb|left|Will Kane and Amy argue in the marshal's office]]

For Amy, a devout [[Quaker]] and [[pacifist]], the solution is simple—leave town before Miller arrives—but Kane's sense of duty and honor make him stay. Besides, he says, Miller and his gang would hunt him down anyway. Amy gives Kane an ultimatum: she is leaving on the noon train, with or without him.

Kane visits old friends and allies, but none can or will help. Judge Percy Mettrick, who sentenced Miller, flees and urges Kane to do the same. Harvey Pell, Kane's young deputy, is bitter that Kane did not recommend him as his successor; he says he will stand with Kane only if Kane ""puts the word in"" for him with the city fathers. When Kane refuses, Pell turns in his badge and pistol. Kane's efforts to round up a posse at Ramírez's Saloon and the church are met with fear and hostility. Some townspeople, worried that a gunfight would damage the town's reputation, urge Kane to avoid the confrontation. Some are Miller's friends, but others resent that Kane cleaned up the town in the first place. Others believe that Kane's fight is not the town's responsibility. Sam Fuller hides in his house, forcing his wife Mildred to tell Kane he is not home. Jimmy offers to help, but he is blind in one eye, sweating, and unsteady. The mayor encourages Kane to leave town. Martin Howe, Kane's predecessor, is too old and arthritic. Herb Baker agrees to be deputized, but backs out when he realizes he is the only volunteer. One last offer of help comes from 14-year-old Johnny. Kane admires his courage, but refuses his aid.
[[File:High Noon (1952) - Trailer.webm|thumb|The film's trailer]]
While waiting at the hotel for the train, Amy confronts Helen Ramírez, who was once Miller's lover, then Kane's, then Pell's. Amy believes the reason Kane refuses to leave town is because he wants to protect Helen, but Helen reveals there is no lingering attachment on Kane's part and she, too, is leaving. When Helen questions why Amy will not stay with Kane, Amy explains that both her brother and father were gunned down by criminals, a tragedy that converted her to Quakerism. Helen nonetheless chides Amy for not standing by her husband in his hour of need, saying that if she was in Amy's place, she would take up a gun and fight alongside Kane.

Pell saddles a horse and tries to persuade Kane to take it. They end up in a fist fight. After knocking Pell senseless, Kane returns to his office to write out his will. As the clock ticks toward noon, Kane goes into the street to face Miller and his gang. Amy and Helen ride by on a wagon, bound for the train. The train arrives, and Miller steps off as the two ladies board.

Kane walks down the deserted main street alone. He manages to kill Ben Miller in the opening salvo. Just before the train departs, Amy hears the gunfire and runs back to town. Kane takes refuge in a stable, and Colby is killed when he comes in after him. Miller sets fire to the stable to flush him out. Kane frees the horses and tries to escape on one, only to be shot off and cornered. Despite her religious beliefs, Amy picks up Pell's pistol and shoots Pierce from behind, leaving only Frank Miller, who grabs Amy as a human shield to force Kane into the open. When Amy claws Miller's face, he pushes her to the ground and Kane shoots him dead.

The couple embrace. As the townspeople emerge, Kane smiles at Johnny, but looks angrily at the rest of the crowd. He drops his marshal's star to the street and departs with Amy.","Drama, Thriller, Western","starring       = {{Plainlist|

<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. -->
On the morning of the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]], the man playing [[Santa Claus]] is drunk. An old man named Kris Kringle discovers this and indignantly complains to event director Doris Walker. Noticing that Kris resembles Santa Claus, Doris persuades Kris to play Santa in the parade himself. Kris is well received and is subsequently hired to play Santa at [[Macy's Herald Square|Macy's New York City store]] on [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]].

The toy department head, Mr. Shellhammer, instructs Kris to recommend overstocked items to undecided shoppers. Instead, Kris directs a woman to another store to fulfill her son's Christmas request. Impressed, the woman informs Shellhammer that she will become a loyal Macy's customer.

Attorney Fred Gailey, Doris's neighbor, takes Doris's daughter, Susan, to see Santa. After hearing Kris speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]] to an orphan girl from [[the Netherlands]], Susan is amazed. Doris, who has raised Susan to not believe in [[fairy tales]], asks Kris to tell Susan ""the truth"", but Kris insists that he really is Santa Claus.

Worried, Doris decides to fire Kris, but [[Rowland Hussey Macy|R. H. Macy]], the store's owner, promises bonuses to Doris and Shellhammer because of the positive publicity Kris has given the store. To alleviate Doris's misgivings, Shellhammer suggests Granville Sawyer administer a ""psychological evaluation"". After doing so, Sawyer is convinced Kris has a [[grandiose delusion]] and insists for Kris to be fired and put in a [[mental institution]]. Meanwhile, Susan shows Kris a magazine photo of her dream house and tells him she wants it for Christmas. Kris promises to do his best.

In the company cafeteria, young employee Alfred tells Kris that Sawyer convinced him that he is unstable simply because he enjoys dressing as Santa Claus. Kris immediately confronts Sawyer, eventually striking him on the head with an umbrella. Sawyer, outraged, brings Kris to [[Bellevue Hospital]]. Tricked into cooperating and believing Doris to be in on the deception, Kris deliberately fails his examination and is recommended for permanent commitment. However, Fred persuades Kris not to give up and represents him in court.

At a hearing before Judge Henry X. Harper, [[District Attorney]] Thomas Mara gets Kris to assert that he is Santa Claus and rests his case, asking Harper to rule that Santa does not exist. In private, Harper's political adviser, Charlie Halloran, warns him that doing so would be disastrous for his upcoming reelection bid. Harper buys time by hearing further evidence. Fred calls Macy as a witness and gets him to admit that he believes Santa Claus exists. Macy then fires Sawyer. Next, Fred calls Mara's own young son, who testifies that his father told him that Santa is real. Mara concedes the point, but goes on to demand that Fred prove that Kris is ""the one and only"" Santa Claus on the basis of a [[competent authority]] by the following day.

Meanwhile, Susan writes Kris a letter to cheer him up, which Doris also signs. When a New York Post Office mail sorter sees Susan's letter, addressed to Kris at the New York courthouse, he suggests delivering all of the [[Dead letter mail|dead letters]] addressed to Santa Claus to Kris and freeing up storage space. As court resumes, Fred is informed of the mail delivery; he argues that the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office]], a branch of the U.S. federal government, has acknowledged that Kris is the one and only Santa Claus by delivering the letters. When the judge insists on seeing the letters, postal employees bring multiple heavy bags of letters to Harper's desk. Harper dismisses the case.

Kris invites Fred, Doris and Susan to a Christmas Day celebration at the facility where he resides, the Brooks’ Memorial Home for the Aged. Susan is sad because what she asked for is not under the tree and loses faith in Kris when he admits he was unable to get her the house she wanted. However, after Kris offers Fred and Doris a route home that avoids traffic, Susan sees her dream house with a ""For Sale"" sign out front; Susan becomes ecstatic and runs through the house. Fred learns that Doris had encouraged Susan to have faith and suggests they get married and purchase the house. Fred and Doris then see a cane in the house that looks like a cane Kris owns. They both begin to ponder whether Kris really is Santa Claus.","Comedy, Drama, Family","starring       = {{Plainlist|

562,The Lost Weekend,"==Plot==
On Thursday, alcoholic New York writer Don Birnam is packing for a weekend vacation with his brother Wick. Although they are leaving mid-afternoon, when Don's girlfriend Helen drops by with gifts for him to enjoy over the weekend and reveals she has two tickets for a concert that afternoon, Don suggests that Wick attend with her; the brothers can then catch a later train. His motive is self-serving:  he has a bottle hanging by a rope outside the window and wants to retrieve it and secure it in his suitcase. Wick eventually discovers the bottle. Don claims to have forgotten it was there; Wick pours it down the drain. Now, knowing that all the liquor Don had hidden in the apartment has been disposed of, and believing he has no money for more, Helen and Wick go to the concert.

After finding ten dollars Wick left for the cleaning lady, Don heads for Nat's Bar, calling in at a liquor store on the way to purchase two bottles of [[Rye whiskey|rye]]. He intends to be back home in time to meet Wick and catch their train but his drinking makes him lose track of time. Arriving home, he sees Wick and Helen on the street and, concealing himself, overhears Wick tell Helen he has given up on helping his brother and is leaving, scolding her for deciding to stay and wait for Don. In due course, Don manages to sneak back into the apartment and hide a bottle while drinking the other one.

On Friday, back at Nat's Bar, Don learns from Nat that Helen came in looking for him the previous night and criticizes Don for treating her so badly. Don says he intends to write a novel about his battle with alcoholism, called ''The Bottle''. In a flashback, he recalls how he first met Helen at the opera house. The cloakroom has mixed up their coats. Subsequently, the two strike up a romance, and he remains sober during this time. While going to meet her parents, he overhears them talking about his unemployment and how they are not certain if he is good enough for their daughter. He loses his nerve and sneaks off, after phoning Helen from a booth and making a phony excuse, ostensibly intending to actually meet her parents later. However, he returns home and gets drunk. She goes to his apartment, where Wick tries to cover for him, but Don confesses that he is two people: ""Don the writer"", whose fear of failure causes him to drink, and ""Don the drunk"", who always has to be bailed out by Wick. Helen devotes herself to helping him.

After telling Nat the story behind his proposed novel, Don heads back home to begin writing it. However, his alcohol cravings get the better of him and he begins a desperate search for that second bottle from the previous night. He cannot remember where he hid it. He goes to a nightclub and, when he realizes he cannot pay the bill, he steals money from a woman's purse. He is caught, thrown out, and told never to return. Once home, he finds the hidden bottle and drinks himself into a stupor.

On Saturday, Don is broke and feeling sick. He decides to pawn his typewriter so he can buy more alcohol, although he dreads the walk to the shop because he feels so ill. He discovers  the pawnshops are closed for [[Yom Kippur]]. Desperate for money, he visits Gloria, a prostitute who has a crush on him. She gives him some money, but he falls down her stairs and is knocked unconscious.

On Sunday, Don wakes up in an alcoholics' ward, where a nurse, Bim Nolan, mocks him and other guests at ""Hangover Plaza"".  Bim offers to help offset his sure-to-come [[delirium tremens]], but Don rejects the assistance and escapes while the staff are occupied with a raving, violent patient.

On Monday, Don steals a bottle of whiskey from a store after threatening the owner and spends the day drinking. Suffering from delirium tremens, he hallucinates a nightmarish scene in which a bat flies in through his window and kills a mouse, spilling its blood. His screams alert a neighbour, who contacts Helen, who immediately goes over. Finding Don collapsed and in a delirious state, she assists him to clean up and get to bed; she stays overnight on his couch.

On Tuesday morning, Don slips out and pawns Helen's coat, the one that had brought them together. She trails him to the pawn shop and learns from the pawnbroker that Don traded the coat for his gun, for which he has bullets at home. She races back to Don's apartment and interrupts him just as he is about to shoot himself. She pleads with him, even going so far as to beg him to drink the last portion of whisky left in the bottle he had stolen and which she had concealed.  She declares she would rather he be alive as an alcoholic. He refuses and, while they are arguing, Nat arrives to return Don's typewriter. After Nat leaves, Helen finally convinces him that ""Don the writer"" and ""Don the drunk"" are the same person. He commits to writing his novel ''The Bottle'', dedicated to her, which will recount the events of the weekend. As evidence of his resolve, he drops a cigarette into the glass of whisky to make it undrinkable.","Drama, Film-Noir","starring       = {{ubl|[[Ray Milland]]|[[Jane Wyman]]|[[Phillip Terry]]|[[Howard da Silva]]|[[Doris Dowling]]|[[Frank Faylen]]}}

[[File:His Girl Friday (1940, SDR).webm|left|thumb|thumbtime=20|Full film]]
Walter Burns, the hard-boiled editor for ''The Morning Post'' of [[Chicago]], learns his ex-wife and former star reporter, Hildegard ""Hildy"" Johnson, is about to marry insurance man Bruce Baldwin and settle down as a housewife in [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. Walter, determined to sabotage these plans, entices a reluctant Hildy to cover one last story: the execution of Earl Williams, a white bookkeeper portrayed as a shy, confused man, convicted of murdering a black policeman. Walter is committed to stop the execution, claiming it is a political move to get the Mayor reelected, since the victim is ""of color"". Hildy agrees on the condition that Walter buy a $100,000 [[life insurance]] policy from Bruce so he can receive a $1,000 commission. In the meantime, she bribes the warden to let her interview Williams in jail. She induces the convicted man to make a compelling argument in his defense, that he was not fully aware of his own actions when he shot the police officer.

Walter does everything he can to keep Hildy from marrying Bruce, eventually accusing her fiancé of stealing a watch, forcing Hildy to bail him out of jail. Exasperated, Hildy quits, but when the convicted man escapes, her journalistic instincts take over. Walter frames Bruce again, and he is immediately sent back to jail. Hildy realizes that Walter is behind the shenanigans, but she prioritizes covering the rapidly escalating Williams story over bailing Bruce out again.

On the run, Williams sneaks into the deserted press room and holds Hildy at gunpoint; the lure of a big [[Scoop (term)|scoop]] proves too tempting for her to resist. Williams's girlfriend Mollie comes looking for him. When the other reporters return, Hildy hides the fugitive in a [[rolltop desk]]. Mrs. Baldwin, Hildy's future mother-in-law, enters and berates her for the way she is treating Bruce. Upon being harassed for Williams's whereabouts by the reporters, Mollie jumps out of the window. The reporters rush out, saving Williams from being found. Walter arrives and has his henchman Louie kidnap Mrs. Baldwin.

Bruce comes into the press room, having wired Albany for his bail and asking for his mother's whereabouts. Hildy is so consumed with writing the story that she hardly notices; Bruce realizes his cause is hopeless and leaves. A disheveled Louie returns, revealing that he had hit a police car while driving away with Mrs. Baldwin and is unsure if she survived in the accident.

Meanwhile, the mayor and sheriff, portrayed as crooked, are informed that the ""reds"" in the city are gathering in support of the execution. The sheriff has no issues against the ""reds"", so he suggests to try to get closer to such voters; the Mayor explains that all that is needed is their approval to keep their jobs in the upcoming election. So, when a messenger brings them a [[Pardon|reprieve]] from the governor, they try to bribe the man to go away and return later, after it is too late.

After Williams is discovered in the desk, Walter and Hildy are handcuffed by the sheriff. However, the messenger returns with the reprieve, just in time to save Williams from the gallows. Walter uses the messenger's statements to blackmail the mayor and sheriff into releasing him and Hildy. Hildy receives a call from Bruce, again in jail because of counterfeit money that was unknowingly transferred to him by Hildy from Walter. Hildy breaks down and admits to Walter that she was afraid that he was going to let her marry Bruce without a fight.

After bailing Bruce out of jail again, Walter asks Hildy to remarry him and promises to take her on the honeymoon they never had in [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]]. Then Walter learns that there is a strike in Albany, which is on the way to Niagara Falls. Hildy agrees to honeymoon in Albany, accepting that Walter will never change.","Comedy, Drama, Romance","starring       = {{Plainlist|

'''''His Girl Friday''''' is a 1940 American [[screwball comedy]] film directed by [[Howard Hawks]], starring [[Cary Grant]] and [[Rosalind Russell]] and featuring [[Ralph Bellamy]] and [[Gene Lockhart]]. It was released by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The plot centers on a newspaper editor named Walter Burns who is about to lose his ace reporter and ex-wife, Hildy Johnson, newly engaged to another man. Burns suggests they cover one more story together, getting themselves entangled in the case of murderer Earl Williams as Burns desperately tries to win back his wife. The screenplay was adapted from the 1928 play ''[[The Front Page]]'' by [[Ben Hecht]] and [[Charles MacArthur]]. This was the second time the play had been adapted for the screen, the first occasion being the 1931 film which kept the original title ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]''.

The script for ''His Girl Friday'' was written by [[Charles Lederer]] and Ben Hecht, the latter of whom is not credited for his contributions. The major change in this version, introduced by Hawks, is that the role of Hildy Johnson is a woman. Filming began in September 1939 and finished in November, seven days behind schedule. Production was delayed because the frequent improvisation and numerous ensemble scenes required many retakes. Hawks encouraged his actors to be aggressive and spontaneous. ''His Girl Friday'' has been noted for its surprises, comedy, and rapid, overlapping dialogue. Hawks was determined to break the record for the fastest film dialogue, at the time held by ''The Front Page''. He used a sound mixer on the set to increase the speed of dialogue and held a showing of the two films next to each other to prove how fast his film was.

''His Girl Friday'' was #19 on [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs|100 Years ... 100 Laughs]] and was selected in 1993 for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] as ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian Announces National Film Registry Selections (March 7, 1994) - Library of Congress Information Bulletin|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/94/9405/film.html|access-date=2020-10-30|website=www.loc.gov}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-10-30|website=Library of Congress}}</ref> The film is in the [[public domain]] because the copyright was not renewed; the play it was based on remained under copyright for several decades until it expired in 2024, fully releasing the film from remaining copyright.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jackson |first1=Matthew |title=11 Classic Films in the Public Domain |url=https://mentalfloss.com/article/92931/11-classic-films-public-domain |access-date=4 January 2019 |work=mentalfloss.com |date=6 March 2017 |language=en}}</ref>

==Plot==
[[File:His Girl Friday (1940, SDR).webm|left|thumb|thumbtime=20|Full film]]
Walter Burns, the hard-boiled editor for ''The Morning Post'' of [[Chicago]], learns his ex-wife and former star reporter, Hildegard ""Hildy"" Johnson, is about to marry insurance man Bruce Baldwin and settle down as a housewife in [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. Walter, determined to sabotage these plans, entices a reluctant Hildy to cover one last story: the execution of Earl Williams, a white bookkeeper portrayed as a shy, confused man, convicted of murdering a black policeman. Walter is committed to stop the execution, claiming it is a political move to get the Mayor reelected, since the victim is ""of color"". Hildy agrees on the condition that Walter buy a $100,000 [[life insurance]] policy from Bruce so he can receive a $1,000 commission. In the meantime, she bribes the warden to let her interview Williams in jail. She induces the convicted man to make a compelling argument in his defense, that he was not fully aware of his own actions when he shot the police officer.

Walter does everything he can to keep Hildy from marrying Bruce, eventually accusing her fiancé of stealing a watch, forcing Hildy to bail him out of jail. Exasperated, Hildy quits, but when the convicted man escapes, her journalistic instincts take over. Walter frames Bruce again, and he is immediately sent back to jail. Hildy realizes that Walter is behind the shenanigans, but she prioritizes covering the rapidly escalating Williams story over bailing Bruce out again.

On the run, Williams sneaks into the deserted press room and holds Hildy at gunpoint; the lure of a big [[Scoop (term)|scoop]] proves too tempting for her to resist. Williams's girlfriend Mollie comes looking for him. When the other reporters return, Hildy hides the fugitive in a [[rolltop desk]]. Mrs. Baldwin, Hildy's future mother-in-law, enters and berates her for the way she is treating Bruce. Upon being harassed for Williams's whereabouts by the reporters, Mollie jumps out of the window. The reporters rush out, saving Williams from being found. Walter arrives and has his henchman Louie kidnap Mrs. Baldwin.

Bruce comes into the press room, having wired Albany for his bail and asking for his mother's whereabouts. Hildy is so consumed with writing the story that she hardly notices; Bruce realizes his cause is hopeless and leaves. A disheveled Louie returns, revealing that he had hit a police car while driving away with Mrs. Baldwin and is unsure if she survived in the accident.

Meanwhile, the mayor and sheriff, portrayed as crooked, are informed that the ""reds"" in the city are gathering in support of the execution. The sheriff has no issues against the ""reds"", so he suggests to try to get closer to such voters; the Mayor explains that all that is needed is their approval to keep their jobs in the upcoming election. So, when a messenger brings them a [[Pardon|reprieve]] from the governor, they try to bribe the man to go away and return later, after it is too late.

After Williams is discovered in the desk, Walter and Hildy are handcuffed by the sheriff. However, the messenger returns with the reprieve, just in time to save Williams from the gallows. Walter uses the messenger's statements to blackmail the mayor and sheriff into releasing him and Hildy. Hildy receives a call from Bruce, again in jail because of counterfeit money that was unknowingly transferred to him by Hildy from Walter. Hildy breaks down and admits to Walter that she was afraid that he was going to let her marry Bruce without a fight.

After bailing Bruce out of jail again, Walter asks Hildy to remarry him and promises to take her on the honeymoon they never had in [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]]. Then Walter learns that there is a strike in Albany, which is on the way to Niagara Falls. Hildy agrees to honeymoon in Albany, accepting that Walter will never change.

===Development and writing===
While producing ''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'' (1939), Howard Hawks tried to pitch a remake of ''The Front Page'' to [[Harry Cohn]] of Columbia Pictures. [[Cary Grant]] was almost immediately cast in the film, but Cohn initially intended Grant to play the reporter, with radio commentator [[Walter Winchell]] as the editor.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=278}} Hawks' production that became ''His Girl Friday'' was originally intended to be a straightforward adaptation of ''The Front Page'', with both the editor and reporter being male.{{Efn|A ""[[Girl Friday (idiom)|girl Friday]]"" is an assistant who carries out a variety of chores. The name alludes to ""Friday"", [[Robinson Crusoe]]'s native male [[dogsbody]] in [[Daniel Defoe]]'s novel. According to Merriam-Webster's, the term was first used in 1940 (the year the film was released).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/girl%20friday|title=Girl Friday|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|access-date=August 17, 2017}}</ref>}} During auditions, Howard Hawks' secretary, a woman, read reporter Hildy Johnson's lines. Hawks liked the way the dialogue sounded coming from a woman, resulting in the script being rewritten to make Hildy female and the ex-wife of editor Walter Burns played by Cary Grant.{{sfn|Phillips|2010|p=308}} Cohn purchased the rights for ''The Front Page'' in January 1939.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}}

Although Hawks considered the dialogue of ''The Front Page'' to be ""the finest modern dialogue that had been written"", more than half of it was replaced with what Hawks believed to be better lines.{{sfn|Mast|1982|pp=208-209}} Some of the original dialogue was left the same, as were all of the characters' names with two exceptions: Hildy's fiancé (now no longer a fiancée) was given the name Bruce Baldwin,{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}} and the name of the comic messenger bringing the pardon from the governor was changed from Pincus to Pettibone.{{sfn|Birmingham|1984|p=261}} [[Harry Cohn]] of [[Columbia Pictures]] approved Hawks' idea for the film project. Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, the writers of the original play, were unavailable for screenwriting. Consequently, Hawks considered [[Gene Fowler]] as the screenwriter, but he declined the job because he disliked the changes to the screenplay Hawks intended to make.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}} Hawks instead recruited [[Charles Lederer]], who had worked on the adaptation for ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]'', to work on the screenplay.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=96}} Though he was not credited, Hecht assisted Lederer in the adaptation.{{sfn|Martin|1985|p=95}} Additions were made at the beginning of the screenplay by Lederer to give the characters a convincing backstory; it was decided that Hildy and Walter would be divorced with Hildy's intentions of remarriage serving as Walter's motivation to win her back.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=97}}

During writing, Hawks was in Palm Springs directing ''Only Angels Have Wings'', but stayed in close contact with Lederer and Hecht.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}} Hecht helped Lederer with some organizational revisions, and Lederer finished the script on May 22. After two more drafts completed by July, Hawks called [[Morrie Ryskind]] to revise the dialogue and make it more interesting. Ryskind revised the script throughout the summer and finished by the end of September before filming began. More than half of the original dialogue was rewritten.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}} The film lacks one of the well-known final lines of the play, ""the son-of-a-bitch stole my watch!"", because films of the time were more censored than [[Pre-Code Hollywood]] films, and Hawks felt that the line was too overused. Ryskind developed a new ending in which Walter and Hildy start fighting immediately after saying ""I do"" in the wedding they hold in the newsroom, with one of the characters stating, ""I think it's gonna turn out all right this time."" However, after revealing the ending to a few writers at Columbia one evening, Ryskind was surprised to hear that his ending was filmed on another set a few days later.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=281}} Forced to create another ending, Ryskind ended up thanking the anonymous Columbia writer, because he felt that his ending and one of his final lines, ""I wonder if Bruce can put us up"", were better than what he had written originally.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=281}} After reviewing the screenplay, the [[Hays Office]] saw no issues with the film, besides a few derogatory comments towards newsmen and some illegal behavior of the characters. During some rewrites for censors, Hawks focused on finding a lead actress for his film.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=281-282}}

===Casting===
{{stack|[[File:His Girl Friday still 2.jpg|250px|thumb|Cary Grant (age 36), Rosalind Russell (age 33), and Ralph Bellamy (age 36) in a promotional picture for the film.]]}}
Hawks had difficulty casting ''His Girl Friday''. While the choice of Cary Grant was almost instantaneous, the casting of Hildy was a more extended process. At first, Hawks wanted [[Carole Lombard]], whom he had directed in the screwball comedy ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'' (1934), but the cost of hiring Lombard in her new status as a freelancer proved to be far too expensive, and Columbia could not afford her. [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Margaret Sullavan]], [[Ginger Rogers]], and [[Irene Dunne]] were offered the role, but turned it down. Dunne rejected the role because she felt the part was too small and needed to be expanded. [[Jean Arthur]] was suspended by the studio when she refused to take it. [[Joan Crawford]] reportedly was considered.<ref name=tcmnotes>{{cite web |title=His Girl Friday (1940) - Notes |url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/206/his-girl-friday#notes |website=TCM.com |publisher=Turner Classic Movies |access-date=June 14, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Hawks then turned to Rosalind Russell, who had just finished MGM's ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939).{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=282}} Russell was upset when she discovered from a ''New York Times'' article that Cohn was ""stuck"" with her after attempting to cast many other actresses. Before Russell's first meeting with Hawks, to show her apathy, she took a swim and entered his office with wet hair, causing him to do a ""triple take"". Russell confronted him about this casting issue; he dismissed her quickly and asked her to go to wardrobe.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=282}}

===Filming===
{{stack|[[File:His Girl Friday 3.jpg|thumb|267px|[[John Qualen]] (age 40) playing a character who is discovered hiding in a [[rolltop desk]].]]}}
After makeup, wardrobe, and photography tests, filming began on 27 September 1939. The film had the working title of ''The Bigger They Are''.<ref name=tcmarticle>{{cite web| last=Miller | first=Frank | url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=206&category=Articles|title= His Girl Friday}}</ref>

The film is noted for its rapid-fire repartee, using overlapping dialogue to make conversations sound more realistic, with one character speaking before another finishes. Although overlapping dialogue is specified and cued in the 1928 play script by Hecht and MacArthur,<ref>Hecht, Ben, & Charles MacArthur, ''The Front Page'', 1928. Samuel French, Inc.</ref> Hawks told [[Peter Bogdanovich]]:

{{quote|""I had noticed that when people talk, they talk over one another, especially people who talk fast or who are arguing or describing something. So we wrote the dialogue in a way that made the beginnings and ends of sentences unnecessary; they were there for overlapping.""{{sfn|Bogdanovich|1997}}}}

{{stack|[[File:His Girl Friday 6.jpg|thumb|275px|Left to right: Cary Grant, Frank Jenks, Roscoe Karns, Gene Lockhart, Pat Flaherty, Porter Hall, Alma Kruger, and Rosalind Russell in one of the final scenes of the film.]]}}
To get the effect he wanted, as [[multi-track sound recording]] was not yet available at the time, Hawks had the sound mixer on the set turn the various overhead microphones on and off as required for the scene, as many as 35 times.<ref name=tcmarticle /> Reportedly, the film was sped up because of a challenge Hawks took upon himself to break the record for the fastest dialogue on screen, at the time held by ''The Front Page''.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=283}} Hawks arranged a showing for newsmen of the two films next to each other to prove how fast his dialogue was.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=284}}

Hawks gave the actors the freedom to improvise some of their lines and actions, as he did with his comedies more than his dramas.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=283}} In her autobiography ''Life Is a Banquet'', Russell wrote that she thought she did not have as many good lines as Grant, so she hired her own writer to ""punch up"" her dialogue. With Hawks encouraging ad-libbing, she was able to slip her writer's work into the movie. Only Grant was wise to this tactic and greeted her each morning with ""What have you got today?""<ref>New York : Random House, 1977. {{ISBN|978-0-394-42134-6}} OCLC 3017310</ref> Her ghostwriter gave her some of the lines for the restaurant scene, which is unique{{clarify|date=June 2023|reason=Unique how?}} to ''His Girl Friday''. It was one of the most complicated scenes to film; because of the rapidity of the dialogue the actors actually ate very little during the scene. Hawks shot this scene with one camera a week and a half into production, and it took four days to film instead of the intended two.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=285}} The improvisations made it difficult for the cinematographers to know what the characters were going to do. Russell was also difficult to film because her lack of a sharp jawline required makeup artists to paint and blend a dark line under her jawline while shining a light on her face to simulate a more youthful appearance.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=284}}

Hawks encouraged aggressiveness and unexpectedness in the acting, breaking the [[fourth wall]] a few times in the film. At one point, Grant broke character because of something unscripted that Russell did and looked directly at the camera, saying ""Is she going to do that?"" Hawks decided to leave this scene in, although it does not appear in the final cut.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=284}}

Owing to the numerous ensemble scenes, many retakes were necessary. Having learned from ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938), Hawks added some [[straight man|straight]] supporting characters in order to balance out the leading characters.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=285}}

[[Arthur Rosson]] worked for three days on [[second unit]] footage at [[Columbia Ranch]].{{fact|date=September 2024}}

Filming was completed on 21 November 1939, seven days past schedule.{{fact|date=September 2024}}

<!--Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]] rules, plot summaries must be between 400 and 700 words. This summary is at 678 words.-->
[[Richard I of England|Richard]], the [[Normans|Norman]] King of England, is taken captive in 1191 by [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria|Duke Leopold]] while returning from the [[Third Crusade]]. Richard's treacherous brother [[John, King of England|Prince John]], aided by fellow Norman [[Guy of Gisbourne|Sir Guy of Gisbourne]], names himself regent of England, increasing the [[Saxons]]' taxes under the pretense of gathering a ransom for Richard.

The Normans exploit and oppress the Saxons. [[Robin Hood|Sir Robin of Locksley]], a Saxon noble, opposes the brutality and rescues [[Much the Miller's Son]] from being executed for [[poaching]], earning Gisbourne's ire. Robin later confronts Prince John at a [[Nottingham Castle]] banquet, telling the assembled guests that he regards John's declaring himself regent as treason. John orders Robin's execution, but he escapes and flees with Much and [[Will Scarlet]] into [[Sherwood Forest]]. John seizes Robin's lands and names him outlaw.

Much is sent to recruit men to join their band. Robin and Will encounter [[Little John|John the Little]] on a [[log bridge]], and after a [[quarterstaff]] contest, welcome him into their ranks. Dozens more men join Robin's band, swearing an oath to despoil the rich while aiding the poor, to fight injustice, and to show courtesy to all oppressed. They start a war against John and Gisbourne, dispatching those who abuse their power.

Robin's band encounters the rotund [[Friar Tuck]], a renowned swordsman. Tuck joins the band and assists in capturing a company of Normans transporting a shipment of gathered taxes. In the company are Gisbourne, the cowardly [[Sheriff of Nottingham]], and King Richard's ward [[Maid Marian|Lady Marian]]. After their capture, the men are humiliated at a celebratory woodland banquet, with Marian given a seat of honor. Initially scornful, she comes to share Robin's views after he shows her examples of Norman brutality against the Saxons. Robin sends the convoy back to Nottingham Castle, telling them that they have Marian's presence to thank for their lives being spared.

Having noted Robin's focus on Marian during the Sherwood banquet, the sheriff suggests hosting an archery tournament, with the Lady Marian presenting a golden arrow as the prize to entrap Robin. Robin enters the tournament, is recognized by his archery skill, and is captured and sentenced to be hanged. Marian aids Robin's Men in a scheme to save him. After his daring escape, he scales the palace walls to thank her, and the two pledge their love for one another. Marian declines Robin's marriage proposal, electing to instead remain in the castle as a spy.

King Richard returns with several of his knights. The Bishop of the Black Canons sees through Richard's disguise and alerts John. John sends disgraced former knight Dickon Malbete to kill Richard, promising Dickon Robin's title and lands. Marian overhears and writes to Robin, but is found out by Gisbourne and sentenced to death. Her nursemaid, Bess, tells Much everything. He intercepts Dickon and kills him after a fight.

Richard and his men, disguised as Norman monks, travel through Sherwood and are stopped by Robin. Assuring Robin they are on the king's business, Richard accepts Robin's offer of hospitality and his condemnation of Holy Crusade, but does not reveal his identity.

Much relays Bess' news. Robin orders his men to find and protect Richard; now certain of Robin's loyalty, Richard reveals himself. Robin coerces the Bishop of the Black Canons to allow them to join his monks in disguise so they can enter Nottingham Castle. Once inside, Richard announces his presence, and a huge melee erupts. Robin kills Gisbourne after a lengthy duel, frees Marian, and prompts John's men to surrender.

Returned to his throne, Richard banishes John and restores Robin's rank, raising him to Baron of Locksley and Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham. The king also [[royal pardon|pardons]] Robin's men, and commands Robin to take the hand of the Lady Marian in marriage. As Robin exits the castle with her, he responds ""May I obey all your commands with equal pleasure, sire.""","Action, Adventure, Romance","starring       = {{Plainlist|

While embarking on his journey, Hutter stops at an inn in which the locals are frightened by the mere mention of Orlok's name.

Hutter rides on a coach to Orlok's castle in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], where he is welcomed by Orlok himself. When he is eating dinner and accidentally cuts his thumb, Orlok tries to suck the blood out, but his repulsed guest pulls his hand away. Hutter wakes up the morning after to find fresh punctures on his neck, which he attributes to mosquitoes. That night, Orlok signs the documents to purchase the house and notices on the table a miniature portrait of Hutter's wife, Ellen, an image that the young man carries with him in a small circular frame. Admiring the portrait, the count remarks that she has a ""lovely neck."" 
[[File:Max Schreck as Count Orlok in Nosferatu – Eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922).jpg|thumb|[[Max Schreck]] as [[Count Orlok]] in ''Nosferatu – Eine Symphonie des Grauens'' (1922)]]
Reading a book about [[vampire]]s that he took from the inn, Hutter begins to suspect that Orlok is indeed a vampire. With no way to bar the door to his bedroom, Hutter desperately tries to hide as midnight approaches. Suddenly, the door begins to slowly open by itself; and, as Orlok enters, a terrified Hutter hides under the bedcovers and falls unconscious. Meanwhile, back in Wisborg, Ellen arises from her own bed and [[Sleepwalking|sleepwalks]] to the railing of her bedroom's balcony. She starts walking on top of the railing, which gets the attention of her friend Harding in the adjacent room. When the doctor arrives, Ellen shouts Hutter's name and envisions Orlok in his castle threatening her unconscious husband.

The next day, Hutter explores the castle, only to retreat back into his room after he finds the coffin in which Orlok is resting dormant in the crypt. Hours later, Orlok piles up coffins on a coach and climbs into the last one before the coach departs; Hutter rushes home after learning of this. The coffins are taken aboard a [[schooner]], where the sailors discover rats in the coffins. All of the crewmen later die, and Orlok takes control of the vessel. When the ship arrives in Wisborg, Orlok leaves unobserved, carries one of his coffins and moves into the house that he purchased.

Many deaths in the town follow after Orlok's arrival, which the local doctors blame on an unspecified plague caused by the rats from the ship. Ellen reads the book that Hutter found; it claims that a vampire can be defeated if a pure-hearted woman distracts the vampire with her beauty and offers him her blood of her own free will; she decides to sacrifice herself. Ellen opens her window to invite Orlok in and pretends to fall ill so that she can send Hutter to fetch Professor Bulwer, a physician. After he leaves, Orlok enters and drinks her blood, but the sun rises, which causes Orlok to vanish in a puff of smoke. Ellen lives just long enough to be embraced by her grief-stricken husband.

Orlok's castle is later shown destroyed.","Fantasy, Horror","starring       = {{plainlist|

Preceding the [[1971 Indo-Pakistani War|Bangladeshi War of Independence, 1971]], Hidayat Khan is an [[India|Indian]] [[intelligence agent]] posing as an [[informant]] for the [[Pakistan|Pakistani]] military. Presenting as an Indian [[traitor]] trading secrets to Pakistan, he cultivates a friendship with [[Brigadier]] Parvez Syed of the [[Pakistan Army]] and is alerted of an operation planned against India. Fearing he will not live long enough to uncover further details due to his [[lung cancer]], he asks his 20-year-old daughter Sehmat, a student at [[Delhi University]], to become an undercover agent of the [[Research and Analysis Wing]], India's [[Espionage|external intelligence]] agency in Pakistan, through an arranged marriage with Syed's younger son, [[Major (rank)|Major]] Iqbal, a Pakistani military officer. Sehmat joins the RAW and is trained by senior RAW officer Khalid Mir and his assistant, Nikhil Bakshi. Despite her youth and inexperience, Sehmat is a quick study, surprising her superiors with her acumen for intelligence work. After her marriage, she moves to their home with Iqbal in [[Rawalpindi]], the Pakistan Army's headquarters. Sehmat wins the trust of the entire family except Abdul, Syed's trusted servant. A kind man, Iqbal is patient with Sehmat, frequently apologizing to her for his father's denigration of India. Feelings develop between them leading to consummation of their marriage, and they start getting intimate. Despite her feelings, Sehmat remains true to her mission and establishes communication channels with her [[Agent handling|handlers]] back in [[India]], relaying information.

Brigadier Syed is promoted to [[Major General]], resulting in crucial documents and members of their defense forces passing through his house. Sehmat relays information on the planning of an offensive against India, which points to a planned attack by a Pakistani submarine on the Indian aircraft carrier {{INS|Vikrant|1961|6}}, then deployed in the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Abdul discovers Sehmat's communication tools in the bathroom and realises she is an Indian spy. He rushes off to tell Syed, forcing Sehmat to run him down with an army jeep, causing a heavy emotional toll on her. Abdul gasps out Sehmat's name in the hospital before he dies, and Iqbal's older brother, Mehboob, starts an investigation. Before he can provide his information to the [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]], Pakistan's internal security agency, Sehmat reluctantly kills him by injecting him with poison. Realising her cover is about to be blown, Mir visits her in disguise and conveys to her an escape plan from Pakistan. Later, Iqbal finds Sehmat's communication tools concealed in Abdul's room alongside a piece of an anklet he had given her as a wedding gift, discovering her secret.

Heartbroken, he confronts Sehmat, who tearfully holds him at gunpoint and tells him her duty is to her country. Before their confrontation can escalate, Mehboob's young son, whom Sehmat had been tutoring to sing a patriotic song for his school's annual Army Day celebration, rushes in, giving her a chance to get away. Realising her duty requires her to kill both the boy and her driver to prevent them from discovering her identity, she walks away and arrives at the meeting point concealed in a [[burqa]].

572,Sound of Metal,"==Plot==
[[Drummer]] Ruben Stone performs in the [[avant-garde metal]] duo Blackgammon with his singer girlfriend, Lou. They live in an [[RV]] and tour the United States performing gigs. When Ruben begins to [[hearing loss|lose his hearing]], he goes to a [[Pharmacy (shop)|pharmacy]] seeking a diagnosis. The pharmacist refers him to a doctor, who finds that Ruben has lost most of his hearing and that the rest will deteriorate rapidly. Although [[cochlear implant]]s may benefit him, insurance does not cover their high cost. The doctor suggests that Ruben eliminate all exposure to loud noises and undergo further testing, but Ruben continues to perform.

Lou wants to stop performing for his safety, but Ruben wants to continue. She is also concerned about his sobriety, as he is a recovering [[drug addict]]. They call his sponsor, Hector, who finds a rural shelter for Deaf recovering addicts run by a man named Joe, a recovering alcoholic who lost his hearing in the [[Vietnam War]]. Ruben leaves with Lou because they will not let her live there with him, and he wants only the implants. Anxious for his well-being, Lou leaves and persuades Ruben to return to the shelter.

Ruben meets the other members of the shelter, attends meetings, and settles into his new life. He is introduced to schoolteacher Diane and the children in her class and learns [[American Sign Language]]. Joe tasks Ruben with writing and sitting peacefully in an effort to make him comfortable with the silence. Ruben joins Diane's class and connects with the children and the rest of the community. He gives the children and Diane drumming lessons.

Joe invites Ruben to stay as an employee of the community. Ruben illicitly uses Joe's office computer to follow Lou's activities and learns she is performing music in Paris. He has his friend Jenn sell his drums and other music equipment, then he sells his RV, using the money for cochlear implant surgery. Ruben asks Joe to loan him money to buy back his RV while he awaits the activation of the implants. Joe refuses, saying that Ruben is behaving like an addict. He asks Ruben to leave the community, as it is founded on the belief that Deafness is not a [[Disability|handicap]].

Ruben has his implants activated but is disappointed by their distorted sound. He flies to [[Paris]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Whipp|first=Glenn|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/awards/story/2021-03-08/sound-of-metal-riz-ahmed-darius-marder|title=How ""Sound of Metal"" taught us how to live during lockdown|date=March 8, 2021|access-date=May 12, 2021|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|archive-date=April 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210413024213/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/awards/story/2021-03-08/sound-of-metal-riz-ahmed-darius-marder|url-status=live}}</ref> to meet Lou at the home of her wealthy father, Richard.

When Ruben tells Lou he wants to return to their music, she responds with interest but begins scratching her arms. Ruben tells her all is well and that she saved his life.

576,Hidden Figures,"==Plot==
[[Katherine Johnson|Katherine Goble]] works at the [[West Area Computers|West Area]] of [[Langley Research Center]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]], in 1961, alongside her colleagues [[Mary Jackson (engineer)|Mary Jackson]] and [[Dorothy Vaughan]], as lowly ""[[Computer (occupation)|computers]]"", performing mathematical calculations without being told what they are for. All of them are [[African-American]] women; the unit is [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated by race]] and [[sex segregation|sex]]. White supervisor Vivian Mitchell assigns Katherine to assist Al Harrison's [[Space Task Group]], given her skills in [[analytic geometry]]. She becomes the first Black woman on the team; head engineer Paul Stafford is especially dismissive.

Mary is assigned to the space capsule [[heat shield]] team, where she immediately identifies a design flaw. Encouraged by her team leader Karl Zielinski, a [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] [[Holocaust survivors|Holocaust survivor]], Mary applies for a NASA engineer position. She is told by Mitchell that, regardless of her mathematics and physical science degree, the position requires additional courses. Mary files a petition for permission to attend all-white [[Hampton High School (Virginia)|Hampton High School]], despite her husband's opposition. Pleading her case in court, she wins over the local judge by appealing to his sense of history, allowing her to attend night classes.

Katherine meets African-American [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] Lt. Col. Jim Johnson, who voices skepticism about women's mathematical abilities. He later apologizes and begins spending time with Katherine and her three daughters. The [[Mercury Seven|Mercury 7]] astronauts visit Langley, and astronaut [[John Glenn]] goes out of his way to greet the West Area women. Katherine impresses Harrison by solving a complex [[mathematical equation]] from redacted documents, as the [[Soviet Union]]'s successful launch of [[Yuri Gagarin]] increases pressure to send American astronauts into space.

Harrison confronts Katherine about her ""breaks,"" unaware that she is forced to walk half a mile (800 meters) to use the nearest restroom designated to ""colored"" people. She angrily explains the discrimination she faces at work, which leads Harrison to destroy the ""colored"" restroom signs and abolish restroom segregation. He allows Katherine to be included in high-level meetings to calculate the space capsule's re-entry point. Stafford makes Katherine remove her name from reports, insisting that ""[[computer (occupation)|computers]]"" cannot author them, and her work is credited solely to Stafford.

Informed by Mitchell that there are no plans to assign a ""permanent supervisor for the colored group,"" Dorothy learns NASA has installed an [[IBM 7090]] electronic computer that threatens to replace human computers. When a librarian scolds her for visiting the whites-only section, Dorothy sneaks out a book about [[Fortran]] and teaches herself and her West Area co-workers programming. She visits the computer room, successfully starts the machine, and is promoted to supervise the Programming Department; she agrees to do so if thirty of her co-workers are transferred as well. Mitchell finally addresses her as ""Mrs. Vaughan"".

Making final arrangements for [[Mercury-Atlas 6|John Glenn's launch]], the department no longer needs human computers; Katherine is reassigned to the West Area and marries Jim. On the day of the launch, discrepancies are found in the IBM 7090 calculations, and Katherine is asked to check the capsule's landing coordinates. She delivers the results to the control room, and Harrison allows her inside. After a successful launch and orbit, a warning indicates the capsule's heat shield may be loose. Mission Control decides to land Glenn after three orbits instead of seven, and Katherine supports Harrison's suggestion to leave the retro-rocket attached to help keep the heat shield in place. ''Friendship 7'' lands successfully.

Though the mathematicians are ultimately replaced by electronic computers, a textual [[epilogue]] reveals Mary obtained her engineering degree and became NASA's first female African American engineer; Dorothy continued as NASA's first African American supervisor; and Katherine, accepted by Stafford as a report coauthor, went on to calculate the trajectories for the [[Apollo 11]] and [[Space Shuttle]] missions. In 2015, she was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. In 2016, NASA dedicated the [[Langley Research Center]]'s Katherine Johnson Computational Building in her honor.","Biography, Drama, History","starring       = {{Plainlist|

577,Paddington 2,"== Plot ==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be 400 to 700 words. -->
[[Paddington Bear|Paddington]], having settled with the Brown family in Windsor Gardens, offers his neighbours emotional support in various ways. To purchase a one-of-a-kind [[pop-up book]] of London in Samuel Gruber's antique shop for his Aunt Lucy's 100th birthday, Paddington performs several odd jobs and saves his wages. One night, he witnesses a burglary at the shop in which the book is stolen. Paddington chases the thief, who escapes, and Paddington is framed and arrested. The thief returns home and is revealed to be the Browns' neighbour, Phoenix Buchanan, an egotistical actor. In court, Mr. Gruber states that he does not believe that Paddington stole the book. However, with no evidence of the thief's existence, Paddington is convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

In prison, Paddington is assigned to laundry duty, but accidentally washes a red sock with the white prison uniforms; the uniforms turn pink, angering the prisoners. The prison's short-tempered chef, Knuckles McGinty, hires Paddington to work in the kitchen after being impressed by his [[marmalade]] sandwich recipe. Meanwhile, the Browns attempt to prove Paddington's innocence, putting up sketches of the thief all over London, while Buchanan uses the book to locate a series of clues within London's landmarks, which reveal the location of a secret treasure. The Browns encounter a fortune teller who informs them that the book's clues lead to the hidden fortune of the book's author.

Because of Paddington's influence, the prison becomes a much livelier and friendlier place, but Paddington struggles to remain positive because the Browns are unable to prove his innocence despite their continuous efforts. Knuckles and two other prisoners, Phibs and Spoon, later tell Paddington that although the Browns mean well, they will eventually forget about him.

Becoming convinced that Buchanan is the culprit, Mary and Henry Brown search for the stolen book inside his house. They find a secret attic where Buchanan's various costumes are stashed, including the disguise he wore to steal the book. However, the Browns' investigation cause them to forget to attend the prison's monthly visiting day, causing Paddington to believe the Browns have forgotten about him.

Paddington joins Knuckles, Phibs and Spoon in a [[prison escape]]. They promise to aid in proving Paddington's innocence, but after escaping, they promptly abandon the idea in order to flee the country, inviting Paddington to join them. Paddington declines, feeling betrayed by Knuckles. While avoiding the police, Paddington uses a public telephone to contact the Browns, who tell him Buchanan is the real culprit. To catch Buchanan, they arrange to meet at [[Paddington station]], where a carnival train carrying the hidden fortune is due to leave.

Paddington reaches the station and boards the train immediately before it leaves. The Browns arrive shortly afterward and use a [[LNER Peppercorn Class A1]] to pursue the carnival train. Buchanan finds the hidden fortune, but Paddington thwarts him. Henry, Judy and Mrs Bird board the carnival train to confront Buchanan, who overpowers them and escapes. Buchanan severs the coupling of the train's [[caboose]] after locking Paddington inside it. However, Judy photographs Buchanan holding the book, and Henry subsequently knocks him unconscious.

Paddington is still trapped in the rear carriage when it derails and crashes into a nearby river. Mary tries to rescue Paddington, but struggles to open the locked carriage. Knuckles, Phibs and Spoon arrive and help Mary save Paddington.

Paddington falls into a coma, but wakes up on Lucy's birthday to find himself at home. He learns that he has been exonerated, Buchanan has been arrested, and the book has been taken by the police as evidence of Buchanan's crimes. Although Paddington is disappointed that he cannot give Lucy the book, he discovers that the Browns and their neighbours arranged for Lucy to visit London herself. Opening the front door to her, Paddington hugs Lucy and wishes her a happy birthday.

Knuckles, Phibs and Spoon are [[pardon]]ed, and Knuckles opens a sandwich restaurant, which becomes incredibly successful. Buchanan is sentenced to ten years in prison. Six months later, he is shown to be putting his experience as a performer to further use by performing elaborate musical numbers with the other prisoners.","Adventure, Comedy, Family","starring       = {{Plainlist|

578,Udta Punjab,"== Plot ==
{{Long plot|date=July 2024}}
Three [[Pakistanis|Pakistani]] youth throw packets of drugs across the border to India for it to be picked up later. Tejinder ""Tommy"" Singh, better known as ""Gabru"" among his fans, is a young and successful [[Punjabis|Punjabi]] musician who lives a luxurious lifestyle. Together with an ostentatious crew led by his uncle Tayaji and cousin Jassi, he routinely indulges in [[cocaine]] consumption. Tommy is popular for his energetic songs with lyrics that often glorify violence and [[drug addiction]]. However, his addiction costs him his music contract and lands him in jail. While in prison, he meets two of his die-hard fans who remark how Tommy's lifestyle had 'inspired' theirs, leading them to murder their own mother for drug money. Realizing that his songs have negatively affected teenagers, Tommy decides to change his ways upon release. A few days later, he engages in an altercation and inadvertently shoots Tayaji, injuring his ear. This causes Tayaji to send Tommy and his crew away to a farmhouse so that he can prepare for an upcoming concert.

Working on the farm is a migrant worker from [[Bihar]] nicknamed Bauria, whose dreams of playing national-level [[field hockey|hockey]] for the country were shattered due to her father's death, pushing her to [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] to work as a laborer. She works for a local landlord who uses agriculture as a [[Front organisation|front]] for drug-peddling. One night, she finds a suspicious packet on the farm and realizes that it is some kind of a drug. She resolves to sell it but her search for a potential buyer lands her in trouble as she unwittingly contacts the original owners of the [[heroin]]. She is captured by the gang of drug peddlers but not before she discards it into a well. As a compensation for their lost drugs, the peddlers forcibly keep her at their house, where she is sexually and physically abused, given drugs, and pimped to men. Some weeks later, she manages to escape.

Over in the neighboring town lives Preet Sahni, a doctor and activist who runs a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] center. Sartaj Singh is a junior policeman who knows about the drug smuggling his seniors are allowing on a large scale. But when it affects his family, as his brother, Balli, [[drug overdose|overdoses]] and is brought to Preet's clinic, he realizes the grave situation. Preet and Sartaj decide to find the root cause of the problem together. Balli is admitted into her drug rehabilitation centre against his will.

At his concert, instead of singing, Tommy starts preaching. Infuriated by his speech about how one should lead one's life, his fans start throwing bottles at him. The angered Tommy urinates in front of the crowd before fleeing. He hides in an old structure and meets Bauria, also hiding. The two share their stories and bond. However, Bauria is recaptured by the same gang when she defends Tommy from being attacked by them. He learns the next day that an arrest warrant has been issued for him because of the public ruckus at the concert, and sets out to find Bauria after realising his feelings for her.

Preet and Sartaj find that the driving force behind the drug problem in Punjab is an elderly man called Virender Singh, who has flourished with the support of his father-in-law, [[Member of parliament|MP]] Maninder Brar. The two go to extreme measures to collect evidence against the politician and put together a report to be sent to the state's Election Commission to thwart Brar's campaign for another term in power. Sartaj and Preet fall in love; however, one night, Preet sees a manic Balli trying to escape from her rehab center. On trying to stop him, she is accidentally stabbed in the neck by him. As Balli is Sartaj's brother, senior officer Jhujar Singh who investigates the homicide decides to send him underground. While falsifying the crime scene he comes across the report made by her and Sartaj, and is infuriated when he sees that he too has been named in the drug racket. He calls Sartaj and knocks him out when he arrives.

Waking up in the presence of the local drug [[mafia]] at their farmhouse, where Bauria is also confined, a bruised and beaten Sartaj is questioned by Jhujar, who is a key member in the drug racket. Sartaj says whatever he did was for the sake of Punjab. At the same time, Tommy enters the house, armed with a hockey stick. Taking advantage of the distraction, Sartaj grabs Jhujar's gun and shoots the whole gang before freeing Balli. Tommy helps Bauria escape from her captors. Balli kneels and cries in front of his brother, whose face is expressionless.

Eventually, it is shown that the government issued an inquiry into Brar's activities and there has been a huge crackdown on the drug menace. Over in [[Goa]], amidst his crew members, Tommy calls Bauria to ask for her real name. Sitting by the beach, she catches sight of a foreigner having fun. Inspired, she says ""Mary Jane"", to which Tommy flirtatiously replies that she is his ""life"", and she ends the call before going for a swim.{{efn|According to the director, ""Mary Jane"", as the name of Bhatt's character, is an allusion to the drug [[marijuana]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/%E2%80%9CI-want-to-make-mainstream-movies-but-not-by-losing-myself-in-the-process%E2%80%9D/article14395252.ece |title=""I want to make mainstream movies but not by losing myself in the process"" |last=Ghosh |first=Sankhayan |date=2016-06-22 |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=2018-07-26 |archive-date=8 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808152122/https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/%E2%80%9CI-want-to-make-mainstream-movies-but-not-by-losing-myself-in-the-process%E2%80%9D/article14395252.ece |url-status=live }}</ref>}}","Action, Crime, Drama","starring       = [[Shahid Kapoor]]<br />[[Alia Bhatt]]<br />[[Kareena Kapoor Khan]]<br />[[Diljit Dosanjh]]

Research scientist [[Galen Erso]] and his family hide on the planet Lah'mu when [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] weapons developer [[Orson Krennic]] arrives to press him into completing the [[Death Star]], a [[superweapon]] capable of destroying planets. Galen's wife Lyra is killed in the confrontation while their daughter [[Jyn Erso|Jyn]] escapes and is rescued by rebel extremist [[Saw Gerrera]].

<!-- Discuss [[Talk:Rogue One#Timeline]] before changing -->Fifteen years later, cargo pilot Bodhi Rook defects from the Empire, taking a holographic message from Galen to Saw on the moon [[Jedha]]. [[Rebel Alliance]] intelligence officer [[Cassian Andor]] learns of the Death Star and Bodhi's defection from an informant. Jyn is freed from an Imperial labor camp on Wobani and is brought to the Rebels' base on [[Yavin IV]], where Rebel leader [[Mon Mothma]] convinces her to find Galen so the Alliance can learn more about the superweapon. Cassian is covertly ordered to aid Jyn but to kill Galen rather than extract him.

Jyn, Cassian, and reprogrammed former Imperial [[Droid (Star Wars)|droid]] [[K-2SO]] travel to Jedha, where the Empire loots [[kyber crystal]]s to power the Death Star. In Jedha City, Saw and his partisans are engaged in an armed insurgency against the Empire and Jyn and Cassian get caught in the crossfire. Aided by blind spiritual warrior [[Chirrut Îmwe]] and his mercenary friend [[Baze Malbus]], Jyn makes contact with Saw, who is holding Bodhi. Saw shows her the message in which Galen reveals he has secretly built a vulnerability into the Death Star. The schematics are located in an Imperial data vault on the planet [[Scarif]].

Onboard the Death Star, Krennic orders a test fire, which destroys Jedha City. Jyn and her group take Bodhi and flee the moon, but Saw remains there to die. Imperial governor [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] congratulates Krennic before using Bodhi's defection as a pretext to take control of the Death Star. Bodhi leads the group to Galen's Imperial research facility on the planet [[Eadu]], where Cassian hesitates to kill Galen. Rebel bombers then attack the facility. Galen is wounded and dies in Jyn's arms before she escapes with her group on a stolen Imperial cargo shuttle. Krennic is summoned by [[Darth Vader]]<!-- Do not link this to Mustafar as it's a misattribution to the primary source. See [[WP:ATT]] --> to answer for the attack on Jedha City. Krennic seeks his support for an audience with the [[Palpatine|Emperor]], but Vader instead force-chokes him and orders him to ensure no further problems occur.

Jyn proposes a mission to steal the Death Star schematics, but the Alliance Council feels there is no chance of victory. Frustrated at their inaction, Jyn's group leads a small squad of volunteers, which Bodhi dubs ""Rogue One,"" to raid the vault. Using the stolen Imperial shuttle, they gain access through the planet's shield. Jyn, Cassian, and K-2SO infiltrate the base while the others attack the [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Imperial garrison]] as a diversion.

The Alliance learns of the raid from intercepted Imperial communications and deploys their fleet in support, leading to a space battle against the Imperial fleet. K-2SO sacrifices himself so Jyn and Cassian can retrieve the data. Chirrut is killed after activating the switch to allow communication with the Rebel fleet, and Baze is killed shortly afterward. Bodhi is killed by a [[grenade]] after informing the Rebel fleet that it must deactivate the planetary shield to allow the transmission of the plans. Rebel [[Admiral Raddus]] uses a [[List of Star Wars spacecraft#Hammerhead corvette (Sphyrna-class corvette)|Rebel ship]] to crash two Imperial [[Star Destroyer]]s into each other; the wreckage destroys the shield generator. Jyn obtains the schematics but is ambushed by Krennic, who is shot and wounded by Cassian. Jyn transmits the schematics to the Rebel command ship moments before the Death Star arrives above Scarif, commanded by Tarkin. He orders the Death Star to destroy the citadel, killing everyone, including Krennic, Cassian, and Jyn.

In the present day, approximately one year after [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]] is defeated by the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] in the nation of Sokovia,{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015)<ref name=""CapCWTimeline"" />}} [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]], [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]], [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]], and [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] stop [[Brock Rumlow (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Brock Rumlow]] from stealing a biological weapon from a lab in [[Lagos]]. Rumlow blows himself up, attempting to kill Rogers. Maximoff telekinetically diverts the explosion, accidentally destroying a nearby building and killing several [[Wakanda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wakanda]]n humanitarian workers in the process.

[[Thaddeus Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thaddeus Ross]], the [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]],  informs the Avengers that the [[United Nations]] (UN) is preparing to pass the [[Sokovia Accords]], which will establish a UN panel to oversee and control the team. The Avengers are divided: [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of politicians. Meanwhile, [[Helmut Zemo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Helmut Zemo]] tracks down and kills Barnes' old Hydra handler, stealing a book containing the trigger words that activate Barnes' brainwashing. At a UN conference in [[Vienna]] where the Accords are to be ratified, a bomb kills King [[T'Chaka (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Chaka]] of Wakanda. Security footage indicates the bomber is Barnes, whom T'Chaka's son, [[T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Challa]], vows to kill. Informed by [[Sharon Carter (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sharon Carter]] of Barnes' whereabouts and the authorities' intentions to kill him, Rogers decides to try to bring in Barnes—his childhood friend and war comrade—himself. Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to [[Bucharest]] and attempt to protect him from T'Challa and the authorities, but all four, including T'Challa, are apprehended by the Bucharest police and [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]].

Impersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, Zemo recites the words to activate Barnes's brainwashing. He questions Barnes, then sends him on a rampage to cover his own escape. Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed ""Winter Soldiers"" are kept in [[Suspended animation|cryogenic stasis]]. Unwilling to wait for authorization to apprehend Zemo, Rogers and Wilson go rogue, and recruit Maximoff, [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]], and [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] to their cause. With Ross's permission, Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, T'Challa, Rhodes, [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]], and [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] to capture the renegades. Stark's team intercepts Rogers' group at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], where they fight until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape.  As Rogers and Barnes are escaping, Rhodes is inadvertently shot down by Vision, and becomes partially paralyzed. The rest of Rogers' team is captured and detained at the [[Raft (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Raft]] prison, and Romanoff goes into exile.

Stark discovers evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes, unaware that they were secretly followed by T'Challa. They find that the other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, who then shows them footage that reveals that the automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 contained Stark's parents, whom Barnes subsequently killed. Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them both, leading to an intense fight, in which Stark destroys Barnes' robotic arm, and Rogers disables [[Iron Man's armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stark's armor]]. Rogers departs with Barnes, leaving [[Captain America's shield (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|his shield]] behind. Satisfied that he has avenged his family's deaths in Sokovia from the Avengers' actions by successfully fracturing them, Zemo attempts suicide, but he is stopped by T'Challa and taken to the authorities.

In the aftermath, Stark provides Rhodes with exoskeletal leg braces that allow him to walk again, while Rogers breaks his allies out of the Raft. In a [[mid-credits scene]], Barnes, granted asylum in Wakanda, chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is found. In a [[post-credits scene]], Parker explores the features of the web shooters built for him by Stark.","Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","starring       = {{Plainlist|

585,The Hateful Eight,"==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->
In 1877, [[bounty hunter]] and [[Union Army]] veteran cavalry Major Marquis Warren heads to Red Rock, [[Wyoming Territory]], with three bounty corpses. His horse gives out, and, faced with a blizzard, Warren hitches a ride on a stagecoach driven by O.B. Jackson. Aboard is bounty hunter John Ruth ""The [[hanging|Hangman]]"", handcuffed to fugitive ""Crazy"" Daisy Domergue, whom he is taking to Red Rock to be hanged. Warren and Ruth had previously bonded over Warren's personal letter from [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Chris Mannix, whose father, Erskine, led a [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost-Causer]] militia called Mannix's Marauders, claims to be Red Rock's new sheriff and joins them. During the trip, Ruth learns about the Confederate bounty on Warren's head for breaking out of and setting fire to a [[prisoner-of-war camp]].

They seek refuge from the blizzard at Minnie's Haberdashery, tended by Bob, a Mexican who claims to be watching the haberdashery in Minnie's and her husband Sweet Dave's absence. The lodge shelters local hangman Oswaldo Mobray, [[cowboy]] Joe Gage, and Confederate general Sanford Smithers, who is planning to erect a [[cenotaph]] for his missing son, Chester Charles. Suspicious, Ruth disarms all but Warren. While Mannix recognizes Smithers as a war hero, Warren wants him dead as revenge for ordering the execution of black [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] at [[Battle of Baton Rouge (1862)|Baton Rouge]]. At dinner, Mannix surmises that the Lincoln letter is fake. Warren responds to Ruth's disappointment by saying his forged letter buys him leeway with whites.

After a small talk, Warren puts one of his guns next to Smithers and claims that he orally raped and murdered Smithers' son, who had tried to claim the bounty. When Smithers reaches for the gun, Warren kills him.

During the confrontation, the coffee is poisoned, which Daisy silently witnessed. Ruth and O.B. drink the coffee; O.B. dies, and Daisy kills the dying Ruth with his own gun. Warren disarms Daisy, leaving her shackled to Ruth's corpse, and holds the others at gunpoint except Mannix, who nearly drank the poisoned coffee himself. Warren deduces, with evidence, that Bob is lying about looking after the haberdashery and kills him. When Warren threatens to kill Daisy, Gage admits that he poisoned the coffee. An unknown man hiding under the floorboards shoots Warren in the groin, and Mobray and Mannix shoot and wound one another.

A flashback shows Bob, Mobray, Gage, and Daisy's brother Jody arriving at the lodge hours earlier. They killed Minnie, Sweet Dave, and all the employees and customers except Smithers, whom they spared to create a believable setting in exchange for his silence. Once they finished hiding the bodies, cleaning the store, and hiding weapons for future use, Jody hid in the cellar as Ruth, Daisy, O.B., Warren and Mannix arrived.

In the present, Warren and Mannix, both seriously wounded, hold Daisy, Gage, and Mobray at gunpoint. When they threaten to kill Daisy, Jody surrenders and is executed by Warren. The surviving gang members claim fifteen hired guns are waiting in Red Rock and offer a deal: if Mannix kills Warren, they will spare him and allow him to collect the bounty on the dying Mobray and the deceased Bob (whose real names are revealed as ""English"" Pete Hicox and Marco ""the Mexican"", respectively). Warren kills Hicox when he tries to persuade Mannix. Warren and Mannix then kill Gage (whose real name is ""Grouch"" Douglass) when he grabs a pistol hidden under a table.
 
Mannix hears Daisy's proposal but deduces she is lying. When Mannix faints from blood loss, Daisy hacks off Ruth's arm and goes for a gun, but Mannix reawakens and wounds her. Mannix and Warren hang Daisy from the rafters in honor of Ruth, who always brought his bounty to the gallows (which earned him the nickname ""The Hangman""). As they lie dying, Mannix reads aloud Warren's fake Lincoln letter, complimenting its detail.","Crime, Drama, Mystery","starring       = {{Plainlist|

587,Loving Vincent,"==Plot==
One year after [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s suicide, postman  [[The Roulin Family#Joseph|Joseph Roulin]] asks his son [[The Roulin Family#Armand|Armand]] to deliver Van Gogh's last letter to his brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]]. Roulin finds the death suspicious, as merely weeks earlier Van Gogh claimed through letters that his mood was calm and normal. Armand reluctantly agrees and heads for Paris.

[[Père Tanguy]], a [[Montmartre]] art supplier, tells Armand that Theo actually died six months after Vincent. He suggests that Armand travel to [[Auvers-sur-Oise]] and look for [[Paul Gachet|Dr. Paul Gachet]], who housed Van Gogh after his release from an asylum, shared his love for art, and attended the funeral. Once there, Armand learns that the doctor is out on business. So he stays at [[Auberge Ravoux|the same inn]] that Van Gogh did during his time in the area. There he meets the temporary proprietress [[Portraits by Vincent van Gogh#Adeline Ravoux|Adeline Ravoux]], who was fond of Van Gogh and also surprised by his death. At her suggestion, Armand visits the local boatman, who informs him that Van Gogh kept close company with Dr. Gachet's sheltered daughter, Marguerite. When Armand visits her, Marguerite denies and is angered when Armand implies that Van Gogh's suicidal mood could have resulted from an argument with her father.

Throughout the investigation, Armand begins to suspect a local boy named René Secretan, who reportedly liked to torment Van Gogh, owned a gun, and had often drunkenly brandished it around town. Dr. Mazery, who examined Van Gogh, also claims that the shot must have come from a few feet away, ruling out suicide. When Armand implicates René, Marguerite confesses that she was in close, but not romantic, relations with Van Gogh, but she does not believe that René was capable of murder.

Dr. Gachet finally returns and promises to deliver Armand's letter to Theo's widow. He admits there was an argument between them – Van Gogh accused Gachet of being a coward for not pursuing his dreams, to which Gachet angrily accused Van Gogh of worsening Theo's health by overly depending on his brother. Gachet posits that this accusation drove Van Gogh to suicide in order to release Theo from the burden. After Armand returns home, postman Roulin later receives word from Theo's widow, [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Johanna]], thanking Armand for returning the letter. Johanna attaches to her letter to Armand one of Van Gogh's letters to her – signed, ""Your loving Vincent.""","Animation, Biography, Crime","starring       = {{plainlist|

591,The Lunchbox,"== Plot ==
Ila ([[Nimrat Kaur]]) is a young [[housewife]] seeking the attention of her husband, Rajeev ([[Nakul Vaid]]), and searching for ways to bring the romance back into her marriage; one of her ideas is to cook delicious [[lunch]]es for him. Through a rare mix-up of the ''[[dabbawala]]s'' (complicated [[food delivery]] system in [[Mumbai]] that picks up and delivers lunches from [[restaurant]]s or homes to people at work), the [[tiffin carrier]] ([[lunchbox]]) Ila prepares for her husband gets accidentally delivered, instead, to Saajan Fernandes ([[Irrfan Khan]]), a middle-aged [[widower]] who is about to retire from his job of an [[accountant]]. Ila eventually realises the mistake and with the advice of her neighbour aunt, Mrs. Deshpande ([[Bharti Achrekar]] - voice only), living in the [[apartment]] above her, writes a [[Letter (message)|letter]] to Saajan about the mix-up and places it in the lunchbox (along with her husband's favourite meal) the next day. An exchange of the messages sent back and forth in the letters with the lunches ignites a friendship between the two, as they share memories and events of their own individual lives.

At work, Saajan is tasked with training his replacement, Aslam Shaikh ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]). Socially distant after his wife's death, Saajan is initially reluctant to interact with Shaikh and train him. After Shaikh reveals that he is an [[orphan]] who taught himself [[accounting]], Saajan gradually warms up to him, and eventually the duo strike a close friendship. At one point, Saajan saves Shaikh's job by covering for his blatant mistakes and becomes the best man at his marriage with Mehrunissa ([[Shruti Bapna]]). Meanwhile, Ila discovers that Rajeev is having an [[extramarital affair]] and gives up hope of rekindling her marriage. In one of the lunchbox letters, she suggests moving to [[Bhutan]] where the cost of living is much cheaper than in [[India]]. Saajan writes back with the suggestion that the two move there together. Ila then offers to meet in person at a popular restaurant but at the appointed time, Saajan does not show up. Upon receiving an empty lunchbox in disappointment the next day, Saajan writes back to the dejected Ila and apologises to her, stating that he did arrive and watched her from a distance, but could not approach her. He explains how young and beautiful she looked, while surmising that he is too old for her and advising her to move on.

Some time later, Ila's father, battling with [[lung cancer]], dies in the care of her mother ([[Lillete Dubey]]), who confesses how unhappy her marriage was. She gives Ila the advice “Sometimes, the wrong train takes us to the right station”. Ila receives the address of Saajan's office from the ''dabbawalas'' only to learn from Shaikh that he has already retired and headed to [[Nashik]]. She writes a farewell message to Saajan announcing that she has decided to leave Rajeev and move to Bhutan with her young daughter, Yashvi. Meanwhile, Saajan changes his mind en route to Nashik and returns to Mumbai. The film ends with Ila waiting for Yashvi to return from school and Saajan heading to her house with the ''dabbawalas'' who regularly picked up and delivered the [[eponym]]ous lunchbox.","Drama, Romance","starring       = {{plainlist|

592,Vicky Donor,"==Plot==
Dr. Baldev Chaddha is a [[fertility]] expert who runs a clinic and a [[sperm bank]] in [[Daryaganj]], [[Delhi]], that guarantees high-quality [[sperm]] for couples. He has more failed cases than successes. He is on the lookout for a healthy and high-performing donor.

Vikram ""Vicky"" Arora hails from an [[Arora]] [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] family and is the only son of his widowed mother Dolly, who runs a small beauty parlour in [[Lajpat Nagar]]. They live with Vicky's grandmother. Vicky is a vagabond who provides no financial support to the household and starts searching for a job that will provide them with a better lifestyle.

Chaddha meets Vicky and likes his happy-go-lucky nature. He believes Vicky is the donor he has been looking for. He stalks him and eventually painstakingly convinces him to become a sperm donor. Though Vicky is hesitant at first, he accepts after being offered a high salary. Chaddha gets Vicky's semen sample tested from a lab and is delighted to hear that it was a sample with a very high sperm count. Chaddha decides to use it for his patients and starts getting high success rates. Vicky hides his career after facing ridicule from his friends but starts spending wildly renovating his house and the parlour. Chaddha too earns handsomely in this business.

Vicky meets an ambitious accountant, Ashima Roy, at the bank, and they fall in love after going out a number of times. They soon wish to get married, but as a divorced [[Bengali people|Bengali]] bank employee wanting to marry a carefree man from a loud [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] family, both face backlash from their families. However, they eventually manage to get everyone's approval. Vicky continues to hide his occupation and stops donating sperm after getting married, ignoring Chaddha, who continues to chase Vicky as he is his most successful donor.

In an ironic turn of events, the couple discovers that Ashima is [[infertile]]. Both of them get tested, but Vicky does not take the fertility test and is forced to admit to being a sperm donor. Taken aback by her husband's strange career, Ashima leaves for her paternal home. Vicky is heartbroken and cuts all ties with Chaddha.

The parlour is soon raided by [[income tax]] officers due to their frivolous renovations. Vicky is arrested on suspicion of handling [[black money]] but is bailed out by Dr. Chaddha, who reveals his occupation to his family members. Vicky's mother is disgusted and also apologises to Ashima. Vicky's grandmother and Ashima's father make them understand how Vicky's deed has helped many families bear children and ask them to have a progressive take on this.

Chaddha's assistant finds out the list of couples to whom Vicky has donated his sperm. Chaddha calls Vicky and Ashima to an event he has hosted where all families that Vicky helped bear children are present and helps Ashima see how his step helped them find happiness. He then tells them that one child is absent. This little girl has lost her parents in an accident. Her grandparents failed to contact Chaddha's clinic and had to send her to an orphanage. Dr. Chaddha suggests the couple adopt a little girl, Diya. Ashima begins to see reason and understands. The couple reunites, adopts the little girl, and Vicky continues to occasionally donate sperm for Chaddha's clinic.","Comedy, Romance","starring       = [[Ayushmann Khurrana]]<br />[[Yami Gautam]]<br />[[Annu Kapoor]]<br />[[Dolly Ahluwalia]]

Shashi Godbole is a traditional [[Marathi people|Marathi]] homemaker and [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]] in [[Pune]] who makes and sells [[Laddu|laddoos]] as a [[Home business|home-run business]]. Her husband Satish and daughter Sapna take her for granted, mock her because of her poor English-speaking skills, and generally treat her with disrespect, making Shashi feel negative, insecure, and underconfident. However, her young son, Sagar, loves her as she is, and her elderly widowed mother-in-law offers her words of sympathy.

Shashi's older sister, Manu, who lives in [[New York City]], invites Shashi's family to the marriage of her daughter, Meera, with Kevin. It is decided that Shashi will travel to New York alone five weeks in advance to help Manu organise the marriage, while her husband and children will join her as the marriage approaches. During her flight to America, Shashi is given inspirational advice by a fellow passenger. Upon her arrival in New York, Shashi is warmly welcomed by Manu and her younger daughter, Radha. While Shashi is in New York, she has a traumatic experience at a [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]] where a staff member is rude to her due to her inability to communicate in English. She is comforted by fellow customer, [[French people|French]] [[chef]] Laurent, who himself is weak in English.

Using the money she earned by selling laddoos, Shashi secretly enrolls in a conversational four-week English class, showing her resourcefulness at navigating an unfamiliar city alone. The class comprises the instructor David Fischer, a [[Mexicans|Mexican]] nanny Eva, a Pakistani taxi driver Salman Khan, a Chinese hairstylist Yu Song, a [[Tamils|Tamil]] software engineer Ramamurthy, a shy [[Afro-Caribbean people|African-Caribbean]] man Udumbke, and Laurent. Shashi quickly becomes a promising and committed student, earns everyone's respect with her charming behavior and her cuisine, and gains self-confidence. Laurent becomes attracted to Shashi, leading to some interpersonal conflict. When he tries to kiss her at the rooftop of a building, Shashi pushes him away and runs off, but fails to explain that she is married.

Meanwhile, Radha finds out about Shashi's secret English classes and is supportive of her pursuit. Shashi begins watching English films at night and does her homework diligently. To complete the English-speaking course and receive an academic certificate, each student must write and deliver a five-minute speech. Shashi's family shows up earlier than planned as a surprise, and after missing out on an event where Sagar injures his leg, Shashi eventually decides to quit because of scheduling conflicts and the fact that she considers herself to be an irresponsible mother since she did not realise that Sagar was injured. The test date coincides with that of the marriage, forcing Shashi to miss the test.

Radha invites David and the entire class to the marriage, where Satish is taken aback at being introduced to a diverse group of people by his wife. Shashi gives a touching and enlightening toast to the married couple in English, surprising everyone. In her speech, Shashi extols the virtues of being married and having a family, describing the family as a safe space of love and respect where weaknesses are not mocked. Satish and Sapna regret treating her with disrespect. David declares she has passed the course with distinction and issues her the certificate. Shashi thanks Laurent for ""making her feel better about herself.""

<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should remain between 400-700 words. Work within the limit and DO NOT ADD -->
On the [[New England]] island of New Penzance, 12-year-old orphan Sam Shakusky attends Camp Ivanhoe, a Khaki Scout summer camp led by [[Scout leader|Scout Master]] Randy Ward. Suzy Bishop, also 12, lives on the island with her parents Walt and Laura, both lawyers, and her three younger brothers in a house called Summer's End.

Sam and Suzy, both introverted, intelligent, and mature for their age, meet in the summer of 1964 during a church performance of ''[[Noye's Fludde]]'' and become [[pen pal]]s. The relationship becomes romantic over the course of their correspondence, and they make a secret pact to reunite and run away together. In September 1965, they execute their plan. Sam escapes from Camp Ivanhoe while Suzy runs away from Summer's End. The pair rendezvous, hike, camp, and fish in the wilderness with the goal of reaching a specific location.

Meanwhile, the Khaki Scouts have become aware of Sam's absence, finding a letter he left behind stating he has resigned. Scout Master Ward tells the Khaki Scouts to use their skills to set up a search party and find Sam. Island Police Captain Duffy Sharp and Ward contact Sam's guardians the Billingsleys, learning they are actually his foster parents and Sam is an orphan with a history of behavioral issues at home.

Eventually, a group of Khaki Scouts confronts Sam and Suzy and tries to capture them. During the resulting altercation, Suzy injures the Scouts' de facto leader Redford with a pair of scissors, and a stray arrow fired by one of the Scouts kills Camp Ivanhoe's dog Snoopy. The Scouts flee, and Sam and Suzy hike to Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet which they name ""Moonrise Kingdom."" They set up camp and as the romantic tension between them grows, they dance on the beach and share each other's first kiss.

Suzy's parents, Ward, the Scouts, and Sharp finally find Sam and Suzy in their tent the next morning. Suzy's parents take her home. Ward gives Sam a letter from the Billingsleys stating that they no longer wish to house Sam. He stays with Sharp while they await the arrival of a Social Services worker, who will likely place Sam in an orphanage and possibly treat him with [[electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]].

While in their treehouse, the Camp Ivanhoe Scouts have a change of heart and decide to help Suzy and Sam. They help Suzy and Sam sneak out and then together paddle to neighboring St. Jack Wood Island to seek out the help of Ben, an older cousin of the scout Skotak. Ben works at Fort Lebanon, a larger Khaki Scout summer camp on St. Jack Wood Island run by Ward's superior, Commander Pierce. Ben decides to try to take Sam and Suzy to a crabbing boat anchored off the island so that Sam can work as a crewman and avoid Social Services. He performs a wedding ceremony, which he claims is not ""legally"" binding, before they leave. Sam, Suzy, and Ben set off for the crabbing boat in a sailboat, but quickly return so that Sam can retrieve Suzy's binoculars. As Sam returns to the camp chapel to look for the binoculars, he is confronted by Redford, who alerts the camp to Sam and Suzy's presence. Suzy's parents, Captain Sharp, Social Services, and the Scouts of Fort Lebanon, under the command of Ward, pursue them.

A violent hurricane and flash flood strike, and Sharp apprehends Sam and Suzy on the steeple of the church in which they first met. Lightning destroys the steeple, but Sharp saves them. During the storm, he decides to become Sam's legal guardian. The hurricane erases Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet from the map. At Summer's End, Sam is upstairs painting a landscape of Moonrise Kingdom. Suzy and her brothers are called to dinner, while Sam slips out of the window to join Sharp in his patrol car, telling Suzy he will see her the following day.","Comedy, Drama, Romance","starring       = <!---Per poster billing--->{{Unbulleted list|[[Bruce Willis]]|[[Edward Norton]]|[[Bill Murray]]|[[Frances McDormand]]|[[Tilda Swinton]]|[[Jason Schwartzman]]|[[Bob Balaban]]}}

[[Thorin Oakenshield]] and his company are being pursued by [[Azog]] and his [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orc]] party. They are ushered by [[Gandalf]] to the nearby home of [[Beorn]], a [[Shapeshifting|skin-changer]] who can take the form of a bear. That night, Azog is summoned to [[Dol Guldur]] by the Necromancer, who commands him to marshal his forces for war. Azog delegates the hunt for Thorin to his son [[Bolg]]. After telling the company about the dangers of Mirkwood, including the Necromancer's rise and the Wood-elves being dangerous, Beorn escorts the company to the borders of [[Mirkwood]], where Gandalf discovers [[Black Speech]] imprinted on an old ruin. This, and a prior request by [[Galadriel]], prompts him to investigate the tombs of the [[Nazgûl]]. Before leaving the company, he warns them to remain on the path. They lose their way in the forest and are ensnared by [[Great Spiders of Mirkwood|giant spiders]]. Bilbo frees the dwarves with the help of the [[One Ring|invisibility ring]] and begins to understand its dark influence when he drops the ring and brutally kills a spider to retrieve it.

The remaining spiders are killed by the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]] led by [[Tauriel]] and [[Legolas]], who capture the Dwarves and bring Thorin before their king, [[Thranduil]]. Thorin confronts the king about his neglect of the Dwarves of Erebor following [[Smaug]]'s attack 60 years earlier and is consequently imprisoned with the other Dwarves. Bilbo, having avoided capture, helps them escape in empty wine barrels that are sent downstream. They are pursued by Wood-elves and ambushed by Bolg and his Orc party, resulting in a three-way battle as they rush down the river in the barrels. The Dwarves escape both groups of pursuers, but [[Kíli]] is wounded with a Morgul shaft. Thranduil seals off his kingdom when an Orc captive reveals that an evil army is amassing in the south, but Tauriel decides to leave and assist the Dwarves and Legolas goes after her. Gandalf and [[Radagast]] investigate the tombs of the Nazgûl and find them empty. Gandalf finds out that the Nine have been called to Dol Guldur and deduces that [[Sauron]] has returned and is preparing for war.

The company is smuggled into [[Esgaroth]] by a bargeman called [[Bard the Bowman|Bard]]. Thorin promises the Master of Laketown a share of the mountain's treasure, and they are given arms and sent off to the mountain. Due to his injury, Kíli is forced to remain behind at Bard's home, tended to by [[List of Middle-earth Dwarves#Fíli|Fíli]], [[List of Middle-earth Dwarves#Óin, son of Glóin|Óin]], and [[List of Middle-earth Dwarves#Bofur|Bofur]]. Bilbo discovers the hidden entrance in the [[Lonely Mountain]] and is sent inside to retrieve the [[Arkenstone]]. However, he accidentally awakens Smaug, who reveals his knowledge of both the dwarves' plot and the return of Sauron.

In Laketown, it is revealed that Bard is a descendant of the last ruler of Dale and possesses the last black arrow capable of killing Smaug. Bard attempts to bring the black arrow to the town's launcher, fearing what may happen in the mountain. However, he is arrested by the Master, charging his son to hide the arrow. Bolg and his Orc party infiltrate the town and attack the four Dwarves, but Tauriel and Legolas arrive and quickly dispatch them.

Meanwhile, Gandalf infiltrates Dol Guldur alone after sending Radagast to warn Galadriel of their discovery at the tombs. He finds and cures [[Thráin II|Thrain]] before they are ambushed by Azog. The Necromancer overpowers and defeats Gandalf and reveals himself as [[Sauron]]. Gandalf watches helplessly as Azog and an Orc army march from Dol Guldur towards the Lonely Mountain.

Inside the mountain, during a long chase, Bilbo and the Dwarves rekindle the mountain's forge using Smaug's flames and melt a large golden statue, hoping to bury Smaug alive in the molten gold. They do so, but Smaug emerges from the gold, stumbles out of the mountain and flies off to destroy Laketown as Bilbo watches in despair.","Adventure, Fantasy","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--PER BILLING POSTER.

613,The Trial of the Chicago 7,"==Plot==
<!---Per Wikipedia synopsis to be between 400-700 words. Do not add excessive detail--->
In August 1968, [[Abbie Hoffman]], [[Jerry Rubin]], [[Tom Hayden]], [[Rennie Davis]], [[David Dellinger]], [[Lee Weiner]], [[John Froines]], and [[Bobby Seale]] make preparations to protest at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago. Five months later, they are arrested and charged with ""[[Anti-Riot Act|crossing state lines]]"" to incite a riot. [[John N. Mitchell]], the Attorney General, appoints [[Tom Foran]] and Richard Schultz as the prosecutors, while all the defendants except Seale are represented by [[William Kunstler]] and [[Leonard Weinglass]].

Judge [[Julius Hoffman]] shows significant prejudice for the prosecution, especially insisting that he and Abbie Hoffman are not related. Seale's attorney, [[Charles Garry]], cannot attend due to illness, leading Judge Hoffman to insist that Kunstler represent him. This insistence is rejected by both Kunstler and Seale. Seale receives support from [[Fred Hampton]] which Judge Hoffman assumes is legal help. Abbie Hoffman openly antagonizes the court. Judge Hoffman removes two jurors who he suspects sympathize with the defendants due to alleged threats from the [[Black Panther Party]] and charges the defendants and their attorneys with  multiple counts of [[contempt of court]]. Tension builds between the defendants.

Numerous undercover police officers and [[FBI]] agents testify. At the time of the convention, Hayden noticed two police officers tailing Davis and attempted to let the air out of their tire, but was caught and later arrested. Abbie and others led a protest to the police station where Hayden was detained but turned around upon seeing the police blockade outside. When trying to return to the park, police had taken control of the hill with orders to disperse the crowd leading to a riot between police and protesters.

Days later, the defendants learn that Fred Hampton was killed during a police raid. In retaliation for Seale continuing to speak up for his constitutional rights, Judge Hoffman has him taken to another room, beaten, and returned gagged and chained. This causes the defense and the prosecution to object, and Judge Hoffman declares Seale's case a [[mistrial]].

The defense puts [[Ramsey Clark]], Attorney General during the riots, on the stand. Judge Hoffman refuses to let him testify in front of the jury as he had declined to initiate prosecutions after the riots because of evidence that the Chicago Police Department instigated them. Dellinger punches a [[bailiff]], resulting in his arrest.

Kunstler presents a tape implicating Hayden to the defendants and preps Hayden for cross-examination. On the night of the riot, Davis tried to pacify officers trying to arrest someone climbing a flagpole. After the police clubbed Davis's head, an enraged Hayden exclaimed, ""If blood is going to flow, then let it flow all over the city!"". The defendants were cornered by police and beaten. Abbie deduces that Hayden had misspoken, claiming the statement would have started with, ""If ''our'' blood is going to flow... ."" Realizing that mistake would be exploitable on the stand, Hayden asks Abbie to testify. Abbie agrees.

At the end of the trial, Hayden is given a chance by Judge Hoffman, who feels Hayden is genuinely remorseful, to make a case for a lenient sentence. However, over Judge Hoffman's objections, Hayden uses his closing remarks to name the 4,752 soldiers who were killed in the [[Vietnam War]] since the trial began. This act prompts many in the court to stand and cheer, with even Schultz choosing to stand out of respect.","Drama, History, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist| <!-- Per alphabetical billing order on poster -->

615,The Fighter,"==Plot==
[[Micky Ward]] is an American [[welterweight]] boxer from [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. Managed by his mother, Alice Ward, and trained by his older half-brother, [[Dicky Eklund]], Micky became a ""stepping stone"" for other boxers to defeat on their way up. Dicky, a former boxer whose peak of success was going the distance with [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] in 1978, has become addicted to [[crack cocaine]]. He is being filmed for an [[HBO]] documentary he believes to be about his ""comeback"".

On the night of an [[Card (sports)|undercard fight]] in [[Atlantic City]], Micky's scheduled opponent Saoul Mamby is ill, and a substitute is found in Mike Mungin who is 20 pounds heavier than Micky, a huge difference in professional boxing, constituting two or three weight classes. Despite Micky's reservations, his mother and brother agree so that they can all get the purse and tell Micky that the fighter is out of shape and has ring rust.  They arrive at the fight and find that the substitute fighter is actually ready for the fight and in top shape, and soundly defeats Micky. Micky retreats from the world and forms a relationship with Charlene Fleming, a former college athlete who dropped out and became a bartender.

After several weeks, Alice arranges another fight for Micky, but Micky is concerned it will turn out the same. His mother and seven sisters blame Charlene for his lack of motivation. Micky mentions he received an offer to be paid to train in [[Las Vegas]], but Dicky says he will match the offer so he can keep training and working with his family. Dicky then tries to get money by posing his girlfriend as a prostitute and then, once she picks up a client, [[Police impersonation|impersonating a police officer]] to steal the client's money. This is foiled by the actual police and Dicky is arrested after a chase and a fight with them. Micky tries to stop the police from beating his brother and a police officer brutally breaks his hand before arresting him. At their arraignment, Micky is released, but Dicky is sent to jail. Micky washes his hands of Dicky.

On the night of the HBO documentary's airing, Dicky's family, and Dicky himself in prison, are horrified to see that it is called ''[[High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell|Crack in America]]'' and depicts how crack addiction ruined Dicky's career and life. Dicky begins training and trying to get his life together in prison. Micky is lured back into boxing by his father, who believes Alice and his stepson Dicky are bad influences and did more damage to his career than good. The other members of his training team and a new manager, Sal Lanano, persuade Micky to return to boxing with the explicit understanding that his mother and brother will no longer be involved. They place Micky in minor fights to help him regain his confidence. He is then offered another major fight against an undefeated up-and-coming boxer. During a prison visit, Dicky advises Micky on how best to work his opponent, but Micky feels his brother is being selfish and trying to restart his own failed career. During the actual match, Micky is nearly overwhelmed, but then implements his brother's advice and triumphs; he earns the title shot for which his opponent was being groomed.

Upon his release from prison, Dicky and his mother go to see Micky train. Assuming things are as they were, Dicky prepares to spar with his brother, but Micky informs him that he is no longer allowed per Micky's agreement with his current team. In the ensuing argument, in which Micky chastises both factions of his family, Charlene and his trainer leave in disgust. Micky and Dicky spar until Micky knocks Dicky down. Dicky storms off, presumably to get high again, and Alice chides Micky, only to be sobered when he tells her that she has always favored Dicky. Dicky returns to his crack house, where he says goodbye to his friends and heads to Charlene's apartment. He tells her that Micky needs both of them and they need to work together. After bringing everyone back together, the group goes to [[London]] for the title fight against welterweight champion [[Shea Neary]]. Micky scores another upset victory and the welterweight title. The film jumps a few years ahead, with Dicky crediting his brother as the creator of his own success.

619,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"==Plot==
<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->
Approaching his [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|111th birthday]], the [[Hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]] begins writing the story of his adventure 60 years earlier for his nephew, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]].

Long before Bilbo's involvement, the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]] king Thrór brought an era of prosperity for his kin under the [[Lonely Mountain]] until the arrival of the [[Dragons in Middle-earth|dragon]] [[Smaug]]. Smaug destroyed the nearby town of [[Dale (Middle-earth)|Dale]], drove the Dwarves out of their mountain and took their hoard of gold. Thrór's grandson, [[Thorin Oakenshield|Thorin]], sees [[Thranduil|King Thranduil]] and his [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]] on a nearby hillside, and is dismayed when they leave rather than aid his people, resulting in Thorin's everlasting hatred of [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]].

In the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]], 50-year-old Bilbo is tricked by the [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]] [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]] into hosting a dinner for Thorin and his company of Dwarves: [[Balin (Middle-earth)|Balin]], [[Dwalin]], [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]], [[Dori (Middle-earth)|Dori]], [[Nori (Middle-earth)|Nori]], [[Ori (dwarf)|Ori]], [[Óin, son of Gróin|Óin]], [[Glóin]], [[Bifur]], [[Bofur]], and [[Bombur (Middle-earth)|Bombur]]. Gandalf's aim is to recruit Bilbo as the company's ""burglar"" to aid them in their quest to enter the Lonely Mountain. Bilbo is unwilling to accept at first, but has a change of heart after the company leaves without him the next day, racing to join them. Travelling onward, the company is captured by three [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Trolls]]. Bilbo stalls the Trolls from eating them until dawn, and Gandalf exposes the trolls to sunlight, turning them to stone. The company locates the Trolls' cave and finds treasure and Elven blades. Thorin and Gandalf each take an Elf-made blade, [[Orcrist]] and [[Glamdring]], respectively; Gandalf gives an [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Elven dagger]] to Bilbo.

[[File:Orcrist.png|thumb|175px|The sword Orcrist as seen in ''The Hobbit'']]
The wizard [[Radagast|Radagast the Brown]] finds Gandalf and the company, and recounts an encounter at [[Dol Guldur]] with the [[Sauron|Necromancer]], a sorcerer who has been corrupting [[Mirkwood|Greenwood]] with dark magic. Chased by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]], Gandalf leads the company through a hidden passage to [[Rivendell]]. There, [[Elrond|Lord Elrond]] discloses a hidden indication of a secret door on the company's map of the Lonely Mountain, which will be visible only on [[Durin's Day]]. Gandalf later approaches the [[White Council]] — consisting of Elrond, [[Galadriel]] and [[Saruman|Saruman the White]] — and presents a [[Morgul blade]], a weapon of the [[Witch-king of Angmar]], which Radagast obtained from Dol Guldur as a sign that the Necromancer is linked to an eventual return of [[Sauron]]. While Saruman presses concern to the more present matter of the Dwarves' quest, requesting that Gandalf put an end to it, Gandalf secretly reveals to Galadriel he had anticipated this and had the Dwarves move forward without him.

The company journeys into the [[Misty Mountains]], where they find themselves amid a colossal battle between [[Giant (mythology)|Stone Giants]]. They take refuge in a cave and are captured by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Goblins]], who take them to their leader, the Great Goblin. Bilbo becomes separated from the Dwarves and falls into a crevice where he encounters [[Gollum]], who unknowingly drops a [[One Ring|golden ring]]. Pocketing the ring, Bilbo finds himself confronted by Gollum. They play a riddle game, wagering that Bilbo will be shown the way out if he wins or eaten by Gollum if he loses. Bilbo wins via trickery, and Gollum notices his ring is lost and that Bilbo has it. Chased by the furious Gollum, Bilbo discovers that the ring grants him invisibility, but when he has a chance to kill Gollum, Bilbo spares his life out of pity and escapes.

Meanwhile, the Great Goblin reveals to the Dwarves that Azog, an Orc war-chief who killed Thrór and lost his forearm to Thorin in battle outside the Dwarven kingdom of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], has placed a bounty on Thorin's head. Gandalf arrives and leads the Dwarves in an escape, killing the Great Goblin. Bilbo exits the mountain and rejoins the company, keeping his newly obtained ring secret. The company is ambushed by Azog and his hunting party and takes refuge in trees. Thorin charges at Azog, who overpowers and severely injures him with his [[Warg (Middle-earth)|Warg]]. Bilbo saves Thorin from the Orcs and challenges Azog, just as the company is rescued by [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|eagles]] summoned by Gandalf. They escape to the safety of the [[Carrock#Carrock|Carrock]] where Gandalf revives Thorin, who renounces his previous disdain for Bilbo.

They see the Lonely Mountain in the distance, where the sleeping Smaug is awoken by a [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]] knocking a snail against a stone.","Adventure, Fantasy","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--CAST LIST TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM POSTER. PLEASE DISCUSS ON TALK PAGE BEFORE CHANGING.-->

626,Apocalypto,"==Plot==
While hunting in the [[Mesoamerica]]n rainforest, Jaguar Paw, his father Flint Sky, and their fellow tribesmen encounter a group of refugees fleeing from war and devastation. Returning to their village, Flint Sky notes that the refugees are sick with fear and urges Jaguar Paw to never allow fear to infect him. Later that night, the tribe gathers around an elder who tells a prophetic story about a being who is consumed by an emptiness that cannot be satisfied, despite having all the gifts of the world offered to him. The being will continue blindly taking until there is nothing left in the world for him to take, and the world is no more.

The next morning, the village is attacked by [[Maya people|Maya]] raiders led by Zero Wolf, and many are killed, including Flint Sky, who is killed by the sadistic raider Middle Eye. During the attack, Jaguar Paw hides both his pregnant wife Seven and their young son Turtles Run in an empty well before he is captured. In the aftermath, the raiders round up the surviving adults who are forced on a long march through the jungle, while the children are left to fend for themselves. Meanwhile, Seven and Turtles Run remain trapped in the well and they struggle to escape it.

Along the way, the raiders and their captives encounter razed forests and vast fields of failed [[maize]] crops, alongside villages decimated by an unknown disease. They then encounter an infected little girl who prophesies the end of the Maya world.<ref>""You are afraid of me, and rightly so, for all you vile beings. Would you know how you will die? The sacred time is near. Beware the darkness of the day. Beware the man who leads the jaguar. Watch him rise from the mud and dust, for he to whom he is leading you will blot out the sky and scratch the earth. He will sweep you away and end your world. He is with us now. The day will be as the night, and the jaguar man will lead you to the end.""</ref> Arriving in the city, the captives are divided; the women are sold into slavery while the men are escorted to the top of a [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid]] where they are [[Human sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures#Maya culture|brutally sacrificed]] to appease the [[Maya religion|gods]]. As Jaguar Paw is laid out on the altar, a solar eclipse occurs and the Maya take the event as an omen that the gods are satisfied, thereby sparing the remaining captives. However, the remaining captives are taken by the raiders to their barracks to be used as target practice; the raiders offer them freedom if they can dodge the missiles thrown at them, while Zero Wolf's son Cut Rock finishes off the wounded. The first pair of runners, including Jaguar Paw's friend Blunted, are easily struck down. Jaguar Paw follows thereafter, and is also wounded, drawing the attention of Cut Rock. However, Cut Rock is then distracted by the mortally wounded Blunted, whose sacrifice allows Jaguar Paw to kill Cut Rock and escape.

An enraged Zero Wolf leads eight of his men to hunt down Jaguar Paw. Reaching the jungle, Jaguar Paw remembers his father's words not to give in to fear, and challenges Zero Wolf to hunt ''him''. Jaguar Paw uses his knowledge of the forest to survive while his pursuers are killed off one by one (one is killed by a jaguar; a second is killed by a snake; a third is killed by Zero Wolf; a fourth drowns in a waterfall; a fifth is poisoned by Jaguar Paw). Among those he kills himself are Middle Eye, whom he bludgeons with a stone hatchet, and Zero Wolf, whom he lures into a spike trap made for [[tapir]] hunts. The last two raiders continue to pursue Jaguar Paw on the outskirts of his village. Reaching the shores amidst a heavy downpour, all three are stunned to witness the arrival of [[Conquistador|Spanish conquistadors]]. While the two raiders approach the foreigners, Jaguar Paw races back to his village and rescues his family before they are drowned by the downpour. Jaguar Paw is also overjoyed to see his infant son who was born underwater.

Later, the reunited family gazes at the Spanish ships. Jaguar Paw chooses not to approach the foreigners, and he and his family depart to start a new life in the forest away from both the Maya and the Spanish.","Action, Adventure, Drama","starring       = {{unbulleted list|[[Rudy Youngblood]]|[[Raoul Trujillo]]|[[Mayra Sérbulo]]|[[Dalia Hernández]]|Jonathan Brewer|[[Gerardo Taracena]]|Rodolfo Palacios|Bernardo Ruiz Juarez|Ammel Rodrigo Mendoza|Ricardo Diaz Mendoza|[[Israel Contreras]]}}

627,Little Miss Sunshine,"==Plot==
Sheryl Hoover is a mother of two living in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. Her husband Richard is an aspiring [[motivational speaker]] and [[life coaching|life coach]]. Dwayne, Sheryl's [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]-reading teenage son from a previous marriage, has taken a [[vow of silence]] until he accomplishes his dream of becoming a [[United States Air Force|fighter pilot]]. Sheryl's brother Frank, a gay scholar of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], is living with the family after having [[Suicide attempt|attempted suicide]]. Richard's foul-mouthed father Edwin is also living with the family after being evicted from a [[retirement home]] for snorting [[heroin]]. Olive, Richard and Sheryl's young daughter, is an aspiring [[Beauty pageant|beauty queen]] coached by Edwin. 

Olive learns she has qualified for the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" beauty pageant being held in [[Redondo Beach, California]], in two days. Richard, Sheryl, and Edwin want to support her, and Frank and Dwayne cannot be left alone, so the whole family attends. Due to financial constraints, they go on an {{convert|800|mi|km|adj=on}} road trip in their yellow [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen van]]. Family tensions play out along the way, amidst the aging van's mechanical problems. When the van breaks down early on, the family learns that they must push it until it is moving at about {{cvt|20|mph}} before it is put into gear, at which point they have to run up to the side door and jump in. Later on, the van's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself, which leads to the family being pulled over by a state trooper.
[[File: VW T2 campervan.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A yellow and white Volkswagen Type 2 vehicle with a dirty roof is parked on a street.|A [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen T2 Microbus]], similar to the one in the film]]

Throughout the trip, the family suffers numerous personal setbacks and discovers their need for each other's support. Richard loses an important contract that would have jump-started his motivational business. Frank encounters the ex-boyfriend who, in leaving him for an academic rival, had prompted his suicide attempt. Edwin fatally [[Drug overdose|overdoses]] on heroin. When the grief counselor refuses to let the family leave his corpse at the hospital while they go to the pageant and return later, they smuggle it into the van, almost getting caught by the police. During the final leg of the trip, Dwayne discovers he is [[Color blindness|colorblind]], meaning he cannot become a pilot. This revelation prompts him to finally break his silence and shout his disdain for his family, though he apologizes after Olive calms him with a hug.

After a frantic race against the clock, the family arrives at the pageant hotel. Sheryl prepares Olive for her performance while Richard is looking into arrangements for Edwin's body. As the pageant begins, Richard and Dwayne realize that the other contestants are slim, sexualized pre-teen girls who perform elaborate dance numbers with great panache. Knowing that the amateur Olive is certain to be humiliated, they try to talk her out of performing. Sheryl insists that they ""let Olive be Olive"", and Olive goes on stage.

The hitherto-unseen dance routine Edwin had taught Olive is revealed to be a [[striptease]] performed to the [[Rocasound]] remix of [[Rick James]]' ""[[Super Freak]]"". Olive's performance horrifies and angers most of the audience and organizers, who demand she be removed from the stage. The members of the Hoover family join Olive on stage and dance alongside her to show their support.

The family is later released from the hotel's security office on the condition that Olive never enters a beauty pageant in California again. Piling into the van with the horn still honking, they happily smash through the barrier of the hotel's toll booth and begin their trip back home to Albuquerque.","Comedy, Drama",,"director       = [[Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris|Jonathan Dayton<br />Valerie Faris]]

Nicholas Angel, a recently promoted [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] [[Sergeant]], is reassigned to the rural town of Sandford, [[Gloucestershire]], for being too exceptional. Angel arrests Danny Butterman for drunk driving, but later discovers that he is the son of [[Inspector]] Frank Butterman, and a police officer himself. Angel is frustrated by the village's mundanity, his and Frank’s incompetent colleagues, and the [[Neighbourhood Watch|Neighbourhood Watch Alliance (NWA)]]'s prioritisation of low crime statistics over law enforcement. Angel and Danny stop the two lead actors of a local production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' for speeding. A cloaked figure later murders the actors, and their deaths are staged as a car crash; only Angel suspects foul play.

Angel and Danny discover an illegal weapons stash, including an old [[sea mine]], and confiscate it. Angel warms to Danny, and together they [[binge-watching|binge-watch]] [[Point Break|action]] [[Bad Boys 2|films]] at Danny's house. That night, a cloaked figure attacks George Merchant, a wealthy land developer, in his home, and kills him in a gas explosion. Angel suspects that the deaths are connected to a recent property deal.

Tim Messenger, a local journalist, approaches Angel at a village fête, claiming to have information. However, a cloaked figure kills Messenger by dislodging masonry from the church's tower. Angel learns from Leslie Tiller, the village florist, about her plans to sell her land to Merchant's business partners. While Angel is retrieving his notebook, a cloaked figure murders Tiller with her garden shears. Angel pursues the killer but to no avail. Angel suspects Simon Skinner, a supermarket manager, as the property deal would have built a rival supermarket, but Skinner has an alibi.

After surmising that there are multiple killers, Angel is attacked in his hotel room by Michael ""Lurch"" Armstrong, an employee of Skinner. He incapacitates him and learns about a secret NWA meeting at Sandford Castle. The NWA, led by Frank, reveals that they committed the murders and staged them as accidents because each victim threatened Sandford's chances of winning ""Village of the Year."" Irene, Frank's late wife and Danny's mother, put everything into helping Sandford win the first-ever competition, but [[Gypsy, Roma and Traveller people (UK)|travellers]] moved in and ruined their chances the night before the adjudicators arrived, driving her to suicide. Frank has since vowed to help Sandford win ''Village of the Year'' every year, whatever the cost. Angel flees, but stumbles into the castle's [[catacombs]], discovering the corpses of the NWA's victims, some of whom Angel had helped arrest or question. Danny suddenly appears and feigns murdering Angel and, pretending to dispose of him, unsuccessfully urges him to return to London for his own safety. After arming himself with the confiscated guns, Angel and Danny engage in a shootout with the NWA. When Frank orders the other officers to arrest them, the pair successfully convinces them of Frank's complicity.

Frank flees, and the officers besiege the supermarket, with Skinner escaping in a police car with Frank. After Angel and Danny engage the offenders in a high-speed chase and shootout, Angel corners Skinner at Sandford's [[miniature park|model village]]. After a fight, Skinner is impaled on a miniature church steeple. Frank attempts to escape in Angel's car, but a swan that the pair had recaptured earlier attacks him. Angel's former superiors ask him to return to London as the crime rate has risen heavily in his absence, but Angel declines and elects to remain in Sandford.

While the officers are reviewing the paperwork of the many arrests, Tom Weaver, the last NWA member, enters the station wielding a [[blunderbuss]]. He shoots at Angel, but Danny takes the bullet. In the resulting struggle, Weaver accidentally activates the sea mine, killing himself and destroying the station. One year later, Angel has been promoted to Inspector and Danny, having survived, has been promoted to Sergeant. After visiting Irene's grave, the two drive to their next crime scene.<!-- STOP!

630,Veer-Zaara,"==Plot==
The [[government of Pakistan]] decides to review unsolved cases pertaining to their Indian prisoners as a gesture of goodwill. Saamiya Siddiqui, a budding Pakistani lawyer, is given the defense of prisoner 786 as her first case. The prisoner, documented under the name Rajesh Rathore, has not spoken for twenty-two years. However, when Saamiya addresses him by his real name, Veer Pratap Singh, he breaks his silence and opens up to her about his story.

Twenty-two years earlier, Zaara Hayaat Khan was a lively young Pakistani woman whose family has a political background and is of high standing in [[Lahore]]. Her engagement is arranged with Raza Shirazi, a wealthy and influential lawyer. Zaara travels to India to fulfill the last wish of her [[Sikh]] nanny: to have her ashes scattered in the [[Sutlej]] River. Her bus met with an accident. Veer, then an [[Indian Air Force]] pilot and a [[Punjabi Sikh]], rescues Zaara and helps her complete her nanny's final wish. She accompanies him to his village to celebrate the festival of [[Lohri]], where she meets his loving aunt and uncle, who raised him. 

The next day, Veer takes Zaara to the train station for her return to Pakistan and is shocked to see her fiancé Raza there to accompany her. Veer confesses that he has fallen in love with her, accepting that they cannot be together. Both depart, believing they will never meet again. Amidst her wedding preparations back home, Zaara realises that she too is in love with Veer. Her mother, however, is against this, as marrying Raza will further her father's political career. Zaara's friend Shabbo secretly calls Veer, begging him to take Zaara away. He promptly quits the Indian Air Force and arrives in Pakistan. Zaara tearfully runs into his arms, causing her father to fall ill with shock and anger. 

Zaara's mother begs Veer to leave Zaara, fearing for her father's reputation and health. Veer respects this and attempts to return home but Raza, outraged and jealous, has him arrested by Pakistani police. He blackmails Veer with two choices: be imprisoned for life on charges of being an Indian spy, with Raza giving Zaara a life full of happiness, or walk free knowing that Raza will make Zaara's life a living hell. Veer sacrifices his freedom out of his deep love for Zaara and is imprisoned in Pakistan. Meanwhile, his return bus falls off a cliff, killing all the passengers, so he is presumed dead to the world. 

Veer requests Saamiya not to mention Zaara whilst fighting the case, believing that she must be married by now; he does not want to ruin her reputation or make her settled life difficult. Saamiya travels to his village to find someone who can prove his true identity. She is shocked to find Zaara and Shabbo at his home.

Shabbo explains that after Zaara thought Veer died in the bus accident 22 years ago, she broke off the marriage with Raza with her father's support. Her parents and Veer's aunt and uncle all eventually passed away within a few years. With the Hayat Khan family basically perished, Zaara and Shabbo left Pakistan and settled in Veer's village in India to fulfill Veer's dream of developing their village further. 

Zaara is shocked to learn that Veer is alive. She accompanies Saamiya back to Pakistan, where the old lovers share an emotional reunion. Her statement and evidence in court prove Veer's innocence and true identity. The judge frees him, apologizing on behalf of Pakistan. Veer and Zaara marry, bid goodbye to Saamiya at the [[Wagah]] border crossing, and return home, finally able to live their lives together.","Drama, Family, Musical","starring       = [[Shah Rukh Khan]]<br />[[Preity Zinta]]<br />[[Rani Mukerji]]

633,The World's Fastest Indian,"==Plot==
In 1967, Burt Munro is a sort of folk hero in [[Invercargill]], known for his friendly easy-going personality, for having the fastest motorcycle in New Zealand and Australia, and for being featured in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' magazine. However, that recognition is contrasted by his exasperated next-door neighbours, some of whom are fed up with his un-neighbourly habits, such as revving his motorcycle early in the morning, urinating on his lemon tree, and not mowing his grass. Burt, however, has a long-time dream; to travel to the US and test his motorcycle's capabilities at the [[Bonneville Speedway]].
However, while modifying his motorcycle, Burt suffers a heart attack. An ambulance takes him to the hospital and he is told he has [[angina]], and is advised to take it easy and not to ride his motorcycle. Burt ignores this advice, and is given medication.

Burt is finally able to save enough to travel by cargo ship to [[Los Angeles]], working his passage as the cook, but when he arrives, he experiences [[bureaucracy#Criticism|bureaucracy]], scepticism, and the indifference of big city people. It is his blunt but gregarious nature which overcomes each hurdle. He wins over the motel clerk, a [[cross-dresser]] named Tina, who assists him in clearing customs and helps him in buying a car. The car salesman allows Burt to use his [[workshop]] and junkyard to build a trailer, and later offers him a job after Burt fine-tunes a number of the cars on the lot. Burt declines the offer, however, and shortly afterwards begins his long trip to [[Utah]].

Along the way, Burt meets numerous helpful people, including highway police, a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] man called Jake who aids him when his trailer fails, a woman named Ada who allows him to repair his trailer in her garage and briefly becomes his lover, and an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] pilot who is on leave from military service in Vietnam.

He finally arrives at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]], only to be blocked by race officials for not registering his motorcycle for competition in advance, and not having the mandated safety equipment. In a show of sportsmanship, however, various competitors and fans in the Bonneville series intervene on his behalf, and he is eventually allowed to make a timed run. Despite various problems, he succeeds in his quest and sets a new [[land speed record]] at the 8th mile of his run; when he reaches 201.851&nbsp;mph (324.847&nbsp;km/h). By the end, his leg is burned by the exhaust, and he then falls with the motorcycle and skids to a stop, but he is able to return home to New Zealand as a hero. An epilogue describes that he went to Bonneville again nine times to compete and set new records.","Biography, Drama, Sport","starring       = {{ubl|[[Anthony Hopkins]]|[[Diane Ladd]]|[[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]]|Aaron Murphy}}

636,Walk the Line,"==Plot==
<!-- Plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400–700 words. Please see WP: FILM PLOT for more information. -->
The film begins in 1968 with [[Johnny Cash]] performing at [[Folsom State Prison]]. As the audience of inmates cheered him on, Cash waited backstage near a table saw. The saw reminded him of his early life. Two decades earlier, in 1944, 12-year-old Johnny was raised on a cotton farm in Dyess, Arkansas, with his brother Jack, his abusive father Ray, his mother Carrie, and his two sisters. One day, Jack was killed in a sawmill accident while Johnny was out fishing. Ray blamed Johnny for Jack's death, saying that the Devil ""took the wrong son"". In 1950, Johnny Cash enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and was stationed in West Germany. While there, he purchased a guitar and found solace in writing songs, including ""[[Folsom Prison Blues]]"" which he developed in 1952. After his discharge from the military in 1954, Johnny Cash returned to the United States and married his girlfriend, Vivian Liberto. The couple moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where Cash worked as a door-to-door salesman to support his growing family, but with little success. One day, Johnny Cash was walking past a recording studio when he was inspired to form a band to play gospel music. He and his band auditioned for Sam Phillips, the owner of Sun Records. Phillips signed them after they played ""Folsom Prison Blues."" The band then toured as [[The Tennessee Three|Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two]], along with other rising stars [[Elvis Presley]], [[Carl Perkins]], and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].

Johnny Cash meets country music singer and songwriter [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]] while on tour, and is immediately smitten. He tries to woo her, but she gently rebuffs his attempts. Despite this, they become friends. As Johnny grew up, he begins abusing drugs and alcohol. Johnny Cash persuades June Carter to go on tour with him, over the objections of Johnny's manager, [[Vivian Cash|Vivian Liberto]]. The tour is a success, but backstage Vivian becomes critical of June's influence over Johnny. After one performance in [[Las Vegas]], Johnny and June sleep together. The next morning, June notices Johnny taking pills and begins to doubt her choice to be with him. At their concert that evening, Johnny is upset by June's apparent rejection and behaves erratically. He eventually passes out on stage. June is upset with Johnny's behavior and decides to dispose of his drugs. She begins to write ""[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]"" as a way to describe her feelings for him and the pain she feels as she watches him descend into addiction.

After returning to [[California]], Johnny Cash traveled to [[Mexico]] to purchase more drugs. He was arrested, and his marriage to Vivian imploded. They divorced, and he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1966. Johnny Cash buys a large house near a lake in Hendersonville, Tennessee, in an attempt to reconcile with his wife, June Carter Cash. Ray, Johnny's father, and other members of the extended Carter family arrive for [[Thanksgiving]]. Ray and Johnny get into an argument, and June's mother urges June to help Cash. Cash goes into detox and awakens next to June, who says they have been given a second chance. They begin a tentative relationship, but June resists Cash's marriage proposals. Johnny Cash performs ""[[I Got Stripes]]"" on stage. The song is so powerful that it causes Johnny to collapse on stage, accompanied by June Carter. Johnny Cash recorded an album live at Folsom Prison after discovering that most of his fan mail was from prisoners. The performance was a success, and Johnny embarked on a tour with June and his band. He later performed ""[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]"" on stage. At the end of the film, Johnny Cash invites June Carter to join him for a duet. He stops in the middle of the song and tells her that he can't sing ""[[Jackson (Johnny Cash and June Carter song)|Jackson]]"" anymore unless she agrees to marry him. June accepts, and they share a passionate embrace on stage. Later, Johnny and his father reconcile their relationship while they are with their families.","Biography, Drama, Music","starring       = {{ubl|[[Joaquin Phoenix]]|[[Reese Witherspoon]]|[[Ginnifer Goodwin]]|[[Robert Patrick]]}}

638,The Notebook,"==Plot== 
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 to 700 words. -->
At a modern-day [[nursing home]], the elderly Duke reads a romantic story from a notebook to a female patient:

In 1940, at a carnival in [[Seabrook Island, South Carolina]], lumber mill worker Noah Calhoun sees 17-year-old heiress Allison ""Allie"" Hamilton, there for the summer. He pursues her, coerces her into dating him, and they begin a romance.

When Allie meets Noah's father Frank Calhoun, he immediately likes her. However, when Noah meets her parents, they disapprove. That night, Noah takes Allie to the abandoned Windsor Plantation, telling her he will buy and restore it. As the sun sets, they start to make love for the first time. Noah's friend Fin interrupts to warn them Allie's parents sent the police out looking for her.

When Allie and Noah return to her parents' mansion, Allie's mother Anne makes it clear they are against the relationship and forbid her from seeing him. Noah leaves and Allie follows, they argue and she impulsively breaks up with him, but immediately regrets it.

The next morning, Anne announces they will be returning to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] immediately. Allie seeks Noah to apologize but is unsuccessful, so she asks Fin to tell him she loves him. Noah rushes to Allie's when he hears but is too late.

Noah writes Allie every day for a year, but Allie's mother intercepts the letters. When all 365 go unanswered, he stops writing to move on. He and Fin enlist and fight in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] where Fin is killed. Allie nurses wounded soldiers in a hospital, meeting Captain Lon Hammond Jr., a young lawyer who comes from [[old money|old Southern money]]. After a few years, they become engaged, to Allie's parents' delight.

Noah returns from the war and finds his father has sold their home so Noah can buy The Windsor Plantation. He believes that if he restores it, Allie will return to him. Once it's completed, Noah resists selling it. As Allie tries on her wedding dress, she sees a newspaper photo of Noah in front of the renovated house and faints.

Allie's feelings for Noah come rushing back, so she asks Lon to take a solo trip before the wedding. Returning to Seabrook, she finds Noah living in their dream house. They rekindle and consummate their relationship. Noah tells Allie about the 365 letters and they realize her mother kept them from her.

Days later, Anne appears to warn Allie that Lon has come to Seabrook. She also reveals that she once loved a lower-class young man in town and still wonders how changed their lives would have been if she had chosen differently. She gives Allie Noah's letters, suggesting she choose wisely.

Noah and Allie argue and he tells her to decide what she wants, not what everyone else does. She drives back to her hotel, sobbing and confused, and confesses her infidelity to Lon. He still wants her back, but she follows her heart and returns to Noah.

In the present, the elderly woman is revealed to be Allie, now suffering from [[dementia]]. Duke is actually Noah, who uses a [[pseudonym]] to not startle her in her disoriented state. The journal he reads to her she wrote during the early stages of her illness, detailing their romance and life together so he could help her come back to him. Noah has kept the promise to read it to her almost daily.

Almost at the end of the journal in the notebook, Allie asks Noah what happened at the end of the story and Noah prompts her that she knows. She briefly recognizes him and remembers. Allie asks how long they have before she forgets again and Duke tells her possibly five minutes. They dance to their song, ""[[I'll Be Seeing You (song)|I'll Be Seeing You]]"", and she asks about their kids.

However, Allie's dementia quickly relapses and she panics to see a stranger touching her, so is sedated. Duke has a heart attack and is treated in the nursing home while Allie is taken to the dementia ward. Upon recovering and despite not being permitted, Duke sneaks into Allie's room in the night. She instantly recognizes him, they kiss, and fall asleep holding hands. They are found in the morning, having died peacefully in each other's arms.","Drama, Romance","starring       = {{Plain list|

644,Waking Life,"==Plot==
An unnamed young man lives an ethereal existence that lacks transitions between everyday events and eventually progresses toward an [[existential crisis]]. He observes quietly but later participates actively in [[Philosophy|philosophical]] discussions involving other characters — ranging from quirky scholars and artists to everyday restaurant-goers and friends — about such issues as [[metaphysics]], [[free will]], [[social philosophy]], and the [[meaning of life]]. Other scenes do not even include the protagonist's presence but rather focus on a random isolated person, a group of people, or a couple engaging in such topics from a disembodied perspective. Along the way, the film also touches upon [[existentialism]], [[Situationist International|situationist]] politics, [[posthuman]]ity, the film theory of [[André Bazin]], and [[lucid dream]]ing, and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name.

Gradually, the protagonist begins to realize that he is living out a perpetual dream, broken up only by occasional [[false awakening]]s. So far, he is mostly a passive onlooker, though this changes during a chat with a passing woman who suddenly approaches him. After she greets him and shares her creative ideas with him, he reminds himself that she is a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterward, he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters, but he begins to despair about being trapped in a dream.

The protagonist's final talk is with a character (played by Richard Linklater) whom he briefly encountered previously in the film. This last conversation reveals this other character's view that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time (and, thus, life); that living is simply the individual's constant negation of God's invitation to become [[God becomes the universe|one with the universe]]; that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality; and that in order to be free from the illusion called life, the individual need only accept God's invitation.

The protagonist is last seen walking into a driveway when he suddenly begins to levitate, paralleling a scene at the start of the film of a floating child in the same driveway. The protagonist uncertainly reaches toward a car's handle but is too swiftly lifted above the vehicle and over the trees. He rises into the endless blue expanse of the sky until he disappears from view.","Animation, Drama, Fantasy","starring       = [[Wiley Wiggins]]

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be 400-700 words. -->
In 1981, a group of former [[American football|football]] coaches and players attend a funeral for  a former football player.

Ten years earlier in the summer of 1971, head coach Bill Yoast of the newly integrated [[T. C. Williams High School]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], is leading his white players in summer workouts. He is informed that [[Herman Boone]], a Black head coach originally hired to coach the city's black high school football team, has been assigned to his coaching staff instead. Then, in an attempt to placate rising racial tensions and the fact that all other high schools in Alexandria are ""whites only"" (despite the [[Brown v. Board of Education|abolition of racial segregation in public schools]]), the school district decides to name Boone the head coach. Boone refuses, believing it is unfair to Yoast, a successful coach who is nominated to the Virginia High School Hall of Fame, but relents after seeing what it means to the Black community. When Yoast tells his white players that he will accept a head-coach position elsewhere, they pledge to boycott the team if he is not their coach. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind and decides to accept Boone's offer to serve as his defensive coordinator.

Boone holds his first team meeting with mostly Black students in the school gymnasium but is interrupted by the arrival of Yoast and several white students. Yoast informs Boone of his decision, but Boone warns Yoast that the Titans are his team, and he will not tolerate Yoast undermining him. On August 15, the players go to [[Gettysburg College]] for [[training camp]]. Early on, the Black and white team members frequently clash in racially-motivated conflicts, especially between defensive captains Gerry Bertier (white) and Julius Campbell (Black). However, through forceful coaching, rigorous training, and a motivational early-morning run to the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery]] followed by an emotional speech by Boone, the team comes together and returns as a united group. Before their first game, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be dismissed. Subsequently, the Titans go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice and slowly gaining support from the community.

Just before the state semi-finals, Yoast is told by the chairman of the school board that they have arranged for the Titans to lose so that Boone will be dismissed and Yoast reinstated as head coach. During the game, the referees make several biased calls against the Titans. Upon seeing the chairman and other board members in the audience looking on with satisfaction, Yoast marches onto the field to warn the head referee that if the game is not officiated fairly, he will expose the scandal to the press. After this, the Titans shut out their opponents and advance to the state championship, but Yoast is told by the infuriated chairman that his actions in saving Boone's job have resulted in the loss of his Hall of Fame nomination.

That night, while celebrating the victory, Gerry is severely injured in a car accident and is [[Paraplegia|paralyzed from the waist down]]. Despite the loss of the All-American linebacker, the Titans mount a comeback in the fourth quarter of the state championship and win the title.

Ten years later, after he has won the gold medal in [[shot put]] in the [[Paralympic Games]], Gerry dies in another car crash caused by a drunk driver. It is his funeral that the former football coaches and players were attending in the opening scene. Julius, whom Gerry's mother formerly disliked, is now holding her hand as he leads the team in a mournful rendition of ""[[Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye]]"".

In the epilogue, descriptions show the players' and coaches' activities after the events in 1971. Coach Boone coached the Titans for five more seasons before retirement, while Coach Yoast assisted Boone for four more years, retiring from coaching in 1990; the two coaches became good friends. After Gerry's death, the gymnasium at T.C. Williams High was renamed after him. Julius would work for the city of Alexandria and remain friends with Gerry until his death.","Biography, Drama, Sport","starring       = {{Plainlist|

In December 1995, Chuck Noland is a [[FedEx]] [[systems analyst]] who travels the world resolving productivity problems. He lives with his girlfriend, Kelly Frears in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The two talk of getting married but keep experiencing setbacks due to Chuck being constantly called away to work, which also starts to put a strain on their relationship. During a Christmas dinner, Chuck is summoned to resolve a problem in [[Malaysia]]. Before leaving, Kelly gives Chuck her grandfather's pocket watch with a photo of her in it. He gives her a small box, saying she can wait to open it on New Year's Eve when he returns, implying it is an [[engagement ring]].

The FedEx cargo plane Chuck boards crashes into the [[Pacific Ocean]] during a violent storm. He is the only survivor, washing ashore on an uninhabited island. Chuck gathers and sorts the FedEx packages that wash ashore. Chuck buries the body of one of the pilots that washes up on the coast. In the following days, Chuck struggles to locate food and water. He unsuccessfully tries to escape the island on a life raft, but is prevented by the tide and injures his leg. Realizing it is unlikely he will be rescued, Chuck opens most of the packages, finding useful items he uses to improve his living conditions. However, he does not open a package with pink angel wings painted on it. While attempting to [[Fire plough|start a fire]], Chuck cuts his hand and furiously throws several objects including a [[Wilson Sporting Goods|Wilson]] [[Volleyball (ball)|volleyball]], leaving a bloodstained handprint. He draws a face into the blood, names the ball ""Wilson"" and begins talking to it. Chuck realizes the chances of his rescue are low due to the wide search area, and decides to perform his own tooth extraction using a rock and an ice skate.

Four years later, Chuck, now bearded and disheveled, has adapted to life alone on the island. After a section from a [[portable toilet]] enclosure washes up, he begins constructing a raft, which he successfully launches past the surf with Wilson, the unopened FedEx package and his belongings in tow. Chuck survives a storm, but afterward, Wilson falls off the raft and floats away. He unsuccessfully attempts to rescue Wilson and is left to grieve his loss. Soon after, he is rescued by a passing cargo ship.

Four weeks later, Chuck is cleaned up and returned to the mainland, where he learns he was [[Presumption of death|presumed dead]] by his family and friends. He is given a hero's welcome home party at the FedEx Headquarters in Memphis, where he learns that Kelly has since married and has a daughter. Kelly is emotionally unable to greet Chuck at his homecoming party. One night, Chuck visits Kelly, where they bond for the last time; the two share a passionate kiss and confess their love for each other, but they both realize she cannot leave her family, and they part ways, with Chuck returning the watch Kelly gave him.

Chuck drives to [[Texas]] to return the angel-winged package to its sender. Finding no one home, he leaves it at the door with a note saying the package saved his life. He departs in his vehicle and stops at a remote crossroads. A woman in a pickup truck, headed in the direction of the house, stops and gives information about where each road leads. As she drives away, Chuck notices the two angel wings painted on the tailgate of her truck. He looks down each road, trying to decide which way to go, before he notices the wind is blowing back down the road where the woman drove, and turns back to her direction with a smile.","Adventure, Drama, Romance","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--Per poster billing-->

In [[Boston]], [[Irish Americans|Irish American]] fraternal twin brothers Connor and Murphy MacManus attend Mass, where the priest mentions the fate of [[Murder of Kitty Genovese|Kitty Genovese]]. Later, while Connor and Murphy are celebrating [[Saint Patrick's Day]] with friends, three Russian mobsters arrive and try to shut down the pub so they can demolish it for the valuable land underneath. Despite Connor and Murphy's attempt to talk them down, a brawl ensues, in which the Russians are defeated and humiliated. The next morning, when two of the Russians seek revenge, the brothers beat them to death in self-defense.

[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agent Paul Smecker is assigned to the case and finds that the police and the press see the MacManus twins as heroes. The duo turn themselves in at a police station, where Smecker interviews them. After the twins retell their incident to Smecker, he declines to press charges and allows them to spend the night in a holding cell to avoid attention from the media. That night, they receive a ""calling"" from God telling them to hunt down wicked men so that the innocent will flourish.

Connor learns that a local hotel is hosting a meeting of the Russian mob. Having equipped themselves with weaponry from an underground gun dealer, the twins kill nine Russian mobsters, while Rocco, a friend of the twins and errand boy for local mafia boss Giuseppe ""Papa Joe"" Yakavetta, surprises them after being sent by his boss to carry out a hit. Realizing that he was set up, Rocco agrees to help Connor and Murphy. That night, they hunt down and kill Vincenzo Lapazzi, Papa Joe's [[underboss]], at a [[peep show]].

Falsely believing that Rocco is behind the murders, Papa Joe hires the legendary hitman, ""Il Duce"", to deal with the problem. Rocco takes revenge on his former crew and convinces the twins to shoot up a gambling den so he can execute a criminal he was once forced to assist in a heinous crime. The three men are then ambushed by Il Duce. Although they manage to escape, the three men suffer serious wounds, including the loss of Rocco's finger.

Hours later, as the police secure the crime scene, the investigation seems futile since the twins covered their tracks by spraying any blood left behind with [[ammonia]]. However, Smecker happens upon Rocco's finger and analyzes it, eventually tracing the clues back to Rocco and his allies. This leaves Smecker in a difficult conundrum; he struggles with the choice of whether to prosecute the three men or join them in their cause as he believes they are doing the right thing. After getting drunk at a [[gay bar]] and subsequently taking advice from a reluctant priest, Smecker decides to help the trio.

Later, the twins and Rocco inform Smecker that they plan to assassinate Papa Joe at his mansion, but Smecker learns that they are walking into a trap. The twins are captured, and Rocco is shot and killed by Papa Joe. As Papa Joe leaves, Smecker arrives disguised as a prostitute and tries to rescue them before being knocked unconscious by Il Duce. While the twins say their family prayer over Rocco, Il Duce enters the room and prepares to open fire. However, he instead finishes the prayer – revealing he is the twins' father and deciding to join his sons in their mission.

Three months later, Papa Joe is on trial for the third time. However, the reporters on-scene anticipate his acquittal. The twins and Il Duce, aided by Smecker, Dolly, Duffy and Greenly, infiltrate the courthouse and take the spectators hostage. Unmasked, they make a speech stating that they intend to eradicate evil wherever they find it before reciting their family prayer and publicly executing Papa Joe.

In a [[mining accident]], John is injured and Bykovsky is killed, devastating Homer. He drops out of high school to work in the mine and provide for his family while his father recovers.

Homer is inspired by Miss Riley to read a book on applied rocket science, learning to calculate the trajectory of a rocket. Using this, he and Quentin locate their missing rocket and prove it could not have caused the fire. The boys present their findings to Miss Riley and the school principal, Mr. Turner, who determines the cause was a [[flare]] from a nearby airfield. Homer tells his father he is returning to high school and no longer wants to work in the mine. The boys return to rocketry and win the school [[science fair]]. When the opportunity arises for one of them to participate in the National Science Fair in [[Indianapolis]], they elect Homer. The miner's union goes on strike against the coal company. With the mines set to close and resenting his father's pressures, Homer storms out of the house, vowing never to return.

At the National Science Fair, Homer's display is well-received. Overnight, someone steals his machined rocket part model – the [[de Laval nozzle]] – and his autographed picture of Dr. [[Wernher von Braun]]. Homer makes an urgent phone call home to his mother Elsie, who implores John to end the strike so that Mr. Bolden, Bykovsky's replacement, can use the machine shop to build a replacement nozzle. John relents when Elsie, fed up with his lack of support for their son, threatens to leave him. With the town's support and replacement parts sent to [[Indianapolis]], the boys win the top prize and Homer is bombarded with college scholarship offers.

He returns to Coalwood as a hero and visits Miss Riley, who is dying of [[Hodgkin lymphoma]]. Preparing for the launch of their largest rocket yet, Homer asks his father to come and tells him that Von Braun is brilliant but is not his hero—implying John is his true idol. At the launch of their rocket, named for Miss Riley, almost all of Coalwood turns out to watch. John is given the honor of pushing the launch button. The ''Miss Riley'' reaches an altitude of {{convert|30000|ft}} – higher than the summit of [[Mount Everest]]. As the town looks to the skies, John puts his hand on Homer's shoulder and smiles, showing Homer that he is proud of him.

An epilogue reveals the real-life outcomes of the main characters' lives, noting that Miss Riley died, the mine closed, and all four Rocket Boys went to college, going on to successful careers, with Homer working at [[NASA]].","Biography, Drama, Family","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--Per poster billing-->

To pay for his wife's care, Nishi borrows money from the ''[[yakuza]]'' but is having difficulty repaying them.

Meanwhile, Horibe, who has been [[paralysis|paralyzed]] since the incident, suffers deep [[Mood disorder|depression]] after his wife and daughter leave him. In a conversation with Nishi, Horibe hints at committing [[suicide]], while adding that he would like to paint but cannot afford to buy himself the necessary materials. After a botched suicide attempt, Horibe receives art supplies mailed to him by Nishi. He then takes up painting and creates [[Surrealism|surreal]] works of art, and later in a [[pointillist]] style.

Nishi buys a second-hand taxicab and repaints it in police colors. He arms himself with a revolver and robs a bank dressed as a policeman.

655,Gattaca,"==Plot==
In the ""not-too-distant"" future, [[eugenics]] is common. A genetic registry database uses [[biometrics]] to classify those so created as ""valids"" while those conceived naturally and more susceptible to genetic disorders are known as ""in-valids"". [[Genetic discrimination]] is illegal, but in practice [[genotype]] profiling is used to identify valids to qualify for professional employment while in-valids are relegated to menial jobs.

Vincent Freeman was conceived naturally, and his genetic profile indicates a high probability of several disorders and an estimated lifespan of 30.2 years. His parents, regretting their decision, use genetic selection in conceiving their second child, Anton Jr. Growing up, the two brothers often play a game of ""[[Chicken (game)|chicken]]"" by swimming out to sea as far as possible, with the first one returning to shore considered the loser; Vincent always loses. Vincent dreams of a career in space travel, but is always reminded of his genetic inferiority. One day, Vincent challenges Anton to a game of chicken and beats him. Anton starts to drown and is saved by Vincent. Shortly after, Vincent leaves home.

Years later, Vincent works cleaning office spaces, including that of spaceflight conglomerate Gattaca Aerospace Corporation. He gets a chance to pose as a valid by using donated hair, skin, blood, and urine samples from former swimming star Jerome Eugene Morrow, who was paralyzed after being hit by a car. With Jerome's genetic makeup, Vincent gains employment at Gattaca and is assigned as a navigator for an upcoming mission to Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. To conceal his identity, Vincent must meticulously groom and scrub down daily to remove his own genetic material, pass daily DNA scanning and urine tests using Jerome's samples, and hide his heart defect.

When a Gattaca administrator is murdered a week before a [[Launch window|possible launch]], the police find one of Vincent's eyelashes near the crime scene, but can only identify it as from an ""unregistered"" in-valid, and thus launch an investigation to find who owns the eyelash. During this, Vincent becomes close to a co-worker, Irene Cassini, and falls in love with her. Though a valid, Irene has a higher risk of heart failure that will bar her from any deep space mission. Vincent also learns that Jerome's paralysis is self-inflicted; after placing [[Silver medal|silver]] in the Olympics, Jerome threw himself in front of a car. Jerome maintains that he was designed to be the best, yet somehow wasn't, and is suffering because of this.

Vincent repeatedly evades the grasp of the investigation. Finally, it is revealed that Gattaca's mission director Josef killed the administrator because he threatened to cancel the mission. Vincent learns that the detective who closed the case was his brother Anton, who consequently has discovered Vincent's presence. The brothers meet, and Anton warns Vincent about his illegal actions, but Vincent asserts that he has gotten to this position on his own merits. Anton challenges Vincent to a final game of chicken. As the two swim out at night, Vincent's stamina surprises Anton, so Vincent reveals that he won by not saving energy for the swim back. Anton turns back and begins to drown, but Vincent rescues him and swims them back to shore.

On the day of the launch, Jerome reveals that he has stored enough DNA samples for Vincent to last two lifetimes upon his return and gives him an envelope to open once in flight. After saying goodbye to Irene, Vincent prepares to board, but discovers there is a final genetic test, and he currently lacks any of Jerome's samples. He is surprised when Dr. Lamar, who oversees background checks, reveals that he knows Vincent has been posing as a valid. Lamar admits that his son looks up to Vincent and wonders whether his son, who is genetically selected, but ""not all that they promised"", could exceed his potential just as Vincent has. The doctor changes the test results, allowing Vincent to pass.

As the rocket launches, Jerome dons his swimming medal and [[Self-immolation|immolates]] himself in his home's incinerator. Vincent opens the note to find a lock of Jerome's hair.","Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist|

Bess McNeill is a young and pretty Scottish woman who has, in the past, had treatment for unspecified [[mental health]] illness after the death of her brother. She marries [[Oil platform|oil rig worker]] Jan Nyman, a Danish [[church (congregation)|non-churchgoer]], despite disapproval from her community and her Free Scottish Presbyterian [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] church. Bess is steadfast and pure of heart but quite simple and childlike in her beliefs. During her frequent visits to the church, she prays to God and carries on conversations with Him in her own voice, believing that He is responding directly through her.

Bess is infatuated with Jan and has difficulty living without him when he is away on the oil platform. Jan makes occasional phone calls to Bess, in which they express their love and sexual desires. Bess grows needy and prays for his immediate return. The next day, Jan is severely injured in an industrial accident and is flown back to the mainland. Bess believes her prayer was the reason the accident occurred and that God was punishing her for her selfishness in asking him to neglect his job and return to her. No longer able to perform sexually and mentally affected by the paralysis, Jan asks Bess to find a lover. Bess is devastated and storms out. Jan then attempts to commit suicide and fails. He falls unconscious and is readmitted to the hospital.

Jan's condition deteriorates. He urges Bess to find another lover and tell him the details, as it will be as if they are together and will revitalise his spirits. Though her sister-in-law Dodo constantly reassures her that nothing she does will affect his recovery, Bess begins to believe these suggestions are the will of God and in accordance with loving Jan wholly. Despite her repulsion and inner turmoil at the thought of being with other men, she perseveres in her own sexual debasement, believing it will save her husband. Bess throws herself at Jan's doctor, but when he rebuffs her, she takes to picking up men off the street and allowing herself to be brutalised in increasingly cruel sexual encounters. In the face of probable expulsion from her church, she proclaims, ""You cannot love words. You cannot be in love with a word. You can only love a human being. That's perfection"". The entire village is scandalised by these doings, and Bess is excommunicated.

Dodo and Jan's doctor agree the only way to keep Bess safe from herself is to have her [[Involuntary commitment|committed]] and move as far away from her husband, whom they believe to be in terminal decline, as possible. Bess decides to make what she thinks is the ultimate sacrifice for Jan: she unflinchingly returns to a derelict ship, where sailors brutally attack her. Dodo and Mrs. McNeill meet a severely injured Bess in the hospital for the last time, forgiving her for her actions; Bess dies in Dodo's arms.

Her church deems her soul to be lost and hell-bound. Unbeknownst to the church elders, Jan, and his friends have substituted bags of sand for Bess's body inside her sealed coffin. Without notice to the church elders, Dodo condemns them, saying no one has the right to consign Bess to [[hell]]. Later, Jan is shown, substantially restored to health despite the doctors not having thought it possible, burying Bess in the ocean, deep in grief. The film ends in [[magical realism]] as Bess's body is nowhere to be seen on the sonar, and church bells ring from on high in the sky.",Drama,"starring       = [[Emily Watson]]<br />[[Stellan Skarsgård]]<br />[[Katrin Cartlidge]]<br />[[Jean-Marc Barr]]<br />[[Udo Kier]]

659,What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"==Plot==
In the small town of Endora, Iowa, Gilbert Grape is busy caring for Arnie, his mentally disabled younger brother who is about to turn 18, as they wait for the many tourists' trailers to pass through town during an annual [[Airstream#Airstreamers|Airstreamers' Club]] gathering at a nearby recreational area. His father had hanged himself seventeen years earlier; since then, his mother, Bonnie, has spent most of her days on the couch watching television and eating. With Bonnie's [[obesity]] leaving her unable to care for her children on her own, Gilbert has taken responsibility for repairing the old house and being protective of Arnie, who has a habit of climbing the town's water tower, as well as trees, while his sisters, Amy and Ellen, do the other housework. A new [[FoodLand]] supermarket has opened, threatening the small Lamson's Grocery where Gilbert works. 

Gilbert is having an affair with a married woman to whom he delivers groceries.  When her husband finds out, there's a horrible scene involving Gilbert, the man's children, and their wading pool.  The husband later dies from a heart attack and drowns in the wading pool. 

A young woman named Becky and her grandmother are stuck in town when the [[International Harvester Travelall]] pulling their trailer breaks down. Gilbert's unusual life circumstances threaten to get in the way of their budding romance. To spend time with Becky to watch the sunset, Gilbert leaves Arnie alone in the bath. He returns home late and finds Arnie still in the bath the following morning, shivering in the now-cold water; his guilt is compounded by his family's anger and Arnie's subsequent [[aquaphobia]]. Becky becomes close to both Gilbert and Arnie. While they are distracted during one of their talks, Arnie returns to the water tower that he is always trying to climb. Arnie is arrested after being rescued from the top of the tower, causing Bonnie — who has not left the house in more than seven years — to become the laughing stock of the town as she goes to the police station, forcing Arnie's release.

Soon, Arnie ruins two birthday cakes: the first, which Amy has lovingly made, accidentally; and the second, a replacement from FoodLand, which he dips into, having found it in the refrigerator. Arnie tries to run away from his bath, and in his frustration, Gilbert finally snaps, hitting Arnie several times. Guilty and appalled at himself, Gilbert flees, driving away in his truck. Arnie also runs to Becky, who takes care of him for the evening, and helps him overcome his aquaphobia, until he is picked up by his sisters. After some soul-searching, aided by Becky, Gilbert returns home during Arnie's 18th birthday party to make amends to his family for running out, and to receive Arnie's reluctant forgiveness. He also apologizes to his mother for his behavior, and vows not to be ashamed of her or let her be hurt anymore. She acknowledges how much of a burden that she has become to the family, and he forgives her. Gilbert also introduces Bonnie to Becky, something he had been reluctant to do.

Following the party, Bonnie climbs the stairs to her bedroom for the first time since her husband's suicide. Arnie tries to wake her, but discovers that she has died. With no way to remove her body from the second floor, the police make plans to return with a crane the next day. The family instinctively knows that there will be a crowd of people there to get a laugh, instead of paying their respects. Wanting to keep her death from becoming a mockery, the family removes the furniture and belongings from the house, after which Gilbert lights a match to burn the house to the ground with her body still inside.

A year later, Amy gets a job managing a bakery in the [[Des Moines]] area, while Ellen looks forward to switching schools and living in a bigger city. Gilbert waits by the side of the road with Arnie, waiting for the tourist trailers to come again. As part of the convoy, Becky arrives with her grandmother and picks them both up. Gilbert tells Arnie, ""We can go anywhere.""",Drama,"starring       = {{Plainlist|

661,The Sandlot,"==Plot==
In the late spring of 1962, fifth-grader Scott Smalls moves to the [[San Fernando Valley]], right outside of [[Los Angeles]] with his widowed mother, and recent stepfather, Bill. As school ends and summer begins, Small's mother encourages him to make friends, and he tries to join a group of boys who play baseball daily at the neighborhood [[Sandlot ball|sandlot]]—brothers Timmy and Tommy Timmons, Michael ""Squints"" Palledorous, Alan ""Yeah-Yeah"" McClennan, Bertram Grover Weeks, pitcher Kenny DeNunez, catcher Hamilton ""Ham"" Porter, and their leader and best player Benny Rodriguez. Everyone but Benny laughs at Smalls' lack of ability, and an attempt to play catch with his stepdad Bill injures Smalls and leaves him with a [[black eye]]. But, Benny still invites him onto the team and helps him improve his skills and earn the boys' respect.

When DeNunez taunts Ham with his trademark pitch, ""The Heater"", Ham hits a [[home run]] into an adjacent backyard, and the team is dismayed. However, they stop Smalls from retrieving the ball and tell him of ""the Beast"", a legendarily fearsome [[English Mastiff]] living behind the fence. According to Squints, in 1942, Mr. Mertle, the owner of the property, bought a young dog, and it grew increasingly big and vicious, until Squints' grandfather, who was chief of police at the time, presented Mr. Mertle with a court order to keep the Beast chained up. In the years since, many baseballs have gone over the fence, but every one has been claimed by the Beast.

One particularly hot day, the team opts to go swimming at the neighborhood pool, in lieu of baseball. While there, Squints fakes drowning to receive [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]] from lifeguard Wendy Peffercorn, with whom he has a crush; he kisses her, and she kicks the boys out, but as they leave Wendy waves at Squints with a warm smile. The team plays a [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] night game by the light of fireworks, and Smalls observes that, to Benny, ""baseball was life."" They later play against a snooty rival [[Little League Baseball|Little League]] team, and win. They later celebrate at a fair, where a combination of [[chewing tobacco]] obtained by Bertram and riding the [[Wipeout (ride)|Trabant]] causes a huge sickly mess.

One day, Benny hits the cover off the team's only ball, much to the team's amazement. With Bill away on business for a week, Smalls opts to keep the game going, by borrowing his prized baseball autographed by [[Babe Ruth]]. Unaware of its value, he hits his first home run, sending it into the Beast's yard. When the team learns of the autograph, they quickly buy another baseball, and forge Babe Ruth's signature on it, to be a temporary replacement, while they come up with a plan to rescue the autographed ball. Smalls suggests going to Mr. Mertle for assistance, but Squints insists Mr. Mertle will not help them. The team attempts to recover the lost ball with various makeshift devices, but each attempt is thwarted by the Beast. As Smalls prepares to accept his fate, Benny dreams of the spirit of Babe Ruth, who advises him to rescue the ball himself. ""Heroes get remembered,"" says the Babe, ""but legends never die. Follow your heart, kid, and you'll never go wrong.""
 
Equipped with a new pair of [[PF Flyers]], Benny retrieves the ball by ""[[Rundown|pickling]]"" the Beast and leaping back over the fence, but the dog breaks its chain and chases him through town. Benny races back to Mr. Mertle's yard, but the Beast crashes through the fence, and it falls down on top of the dog. Smalls and Benny free the dog, who gratefully licks Smalls' face and leads them to its stash of baseballs. The two meet Mr. Mertle, who turns out to have been a baseball player and friendly rival of Babe Ruth, having lost his sight after being [[Hit by pitch|struck by a pitch]]. He kindly trades them the chewed-up ball for one autographed by all the [[1927 New York Yankees season|Murderer’s Row]], and asks them to visit every week to talk baseball.

Bill loves the Murderer's Row ball, but still grounds Smalls for a week for taking and ruining his autographed ball. Their relationship improves and Smalls begins to call him “Dad”. The boys continue to play on the sandlot the rest of that summer, and several subsequent summers with the Beast – whose real name is Hercules – as their mascot. As the years pass, they eventually go their separate ways: Yeah-Yeah enlists in the army, and later develops [[bungee jumping]]; Bertram disappears into the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture movement]]; Timmy and Tommy become wealthy upon inventing [[strip malls|mini-malls]]; Squints marries Wendy, has nine kids with her and the two run the local drug store; Ham becomes a professional wrestler: ""The Great Hambino""; DeNunez plays [[Triple-A (baseball)|triple-A baseball]], but later owns a business, and coaches his sons' Little League team: The Heaters; and Benny earns the nickname ""the Jet"" after word spreads around about his encounter with the Beast.

As an adult, Smalls becomes a [[sports commentator]] and remains friends with Benny, now a player for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Performing the play-by-play for a Dodgers game, Smalls cheers Benny on as he steals home to win the game, and they give each other the same [[Thumb signal|thumbs-up]] sign they have shared since childhood. In Smalls' dugout, he owns, and keeps on display: the chewed-up Babe Ruth autographed ball, the Murderer's Row ball, the forged Babe Ruth ball, some of Bill's pictures of Babe Ruth, and a large picture of the Sandlot kids from 1962.","Comedy, Drama, Family","starring       = {{Plainlist|

665,A Bronx Tale,"==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->
In 1960, nine-year-old Calogero lives in [[Belmont, Bronx|Belmont]], a working-class [[Italian Americans|Italian-American]] neighborhood in [[the Bronx]] with his father, Lorenzo, a [[Surface Transportation Corporation|Surface Transit]] (later [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]]) bus driver, and his mother, Rosina. Calogero becomes enamored of the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] presence in his neighborhood led by local boss Sonny. One day, Calogero sees Sonny shoot and kill a man assaulting his friend. Calogero keeps quiet when questioned by [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] detectives. Sonny's men offer Lorenzo a better-paying job but, preferring a law-abiding life, he politely declines. Sonny befriends Calogero and gives him the nickname ""C"". Calogero earns tips working in Sonny's bar and [[craps|throwing dice]], and is admonished by Lorenzo when he discovers the cash. Lorenzo returns the money to Sonny and warns him to keep away from Calogero.

Eight years later, a 17-year-old Calogero has been visiting Sonny regularly without his father's knowledge. Calogero is part of a gang of local Italian-American boys, which concerns Sonny, who doesn't wish him a life of crime. Calogero meets an [[African Americans|African-American]] girl, Jane, and a tentative romance blossoms between them. Despite the high racial tensions between Italian-Americans and African-Americans in the area, Calogero arranges a date with Jane. He asks for advice from Sonny, who lends Calogero his car to impress her. Earlier, Calogero's friends beat up a group of African-American cyclists riding through their neighborhood. One of the cyclists turns out to be Jane's brother, who accuses Calogero of beating him up when he and Jane meet for their date. Calogero loses his temper over the accusation, and calls him a [[nigger]],<!-- Leave the slur name as is per WP:UNCENSORED --> which he instantly regrets. Jane, disappointed, leaves with her brother.

At home, Lorenzo confronts Calogero after seeing him driving Sonny's car. They argue and Calogero storms out. He runs into his friends, who tell him that some African-Americans [[Egging|egged]] their social club in retaliation to the earlier beating. Sonny and his crew confront Calogero after finding a bomb on Sonny's car. Calogero tearfully pleads his unwavering dedication to Sonny, who recognizes his innocence and allows him to leave. Calogero meets up with friends, who plan revenge on the African-Americans using [[Molotov cocktail]]s. They pressure Calogero into participating, but Sonny stops their car and orders Calogero out. Calogero catches up with Jane, who tells him that her brother admitted that Calogero was not his assailant. Jane and Calogero make amends, but he suddenly remembers his friends' plans to attack Jane's neighborhood, and the two rush to stop them. During the attack, an African-American shopkeeper throws an unbroken Molotov cocktail back at the boys' car, which enters through the window and ignites the Molotov cocktails still inside, causing an explosion that kills everyone inside. When Calogero and Jane arrive, they find the car engulfed in flames.

Calogero leaves and rushes into Sonny's bar to thank him for saving his life, but a young man (who had planted the bomb) shoots Sonny in the back of the head before Calogero can warn him. Calogero later learns that the killer was sent to avenge his father's death from eight years earlier. At Sonny's funeral, countless people come to pay their respects, but, as Sonny had once stated, none seem to really care about his death. When everyone but Calogero disperses, a lone man, Carmine, visits the funeral, and tells Calogero that Sonny once saved his life as well. Calogero does not recognize Carmine until he sees a scar on his forehead and realizes he was the man Sonny defended. Carmine tells Calogero that he is filling in for Sonny in the neighborhood for the time being and promises Calogero help should he ever need it. Carmine leaves just as Lorenzo unexpectedly arrives to pay his respects to Sonny. Lorenzo thanks him for saving his son's life and admits that he never hated him, but that he resented him for making Calogero grow up so quickly. Calogero bids Sonny goodbye and walks home with Lorenzo while narrating the lessons he learned from his two mentors.","Crime, Drama, Romance",,"director       = [[Robert De Niro]]

670,Boyz n the Hood,"==Plot==
In 1984, ten-year-old Jason ""Tre"" Styles III lives with his single mother, Reva Devereaux, in [[Inglewood, California]]. After Tre gets into a fight at school, his teacher informs Reva that although intelligent, he lacks maturity and respect. Concerned about Tre's future, Reva sends him to live in the [[Crenshaw, Los Angeles|Crenshaw]] neighborhood of [[South Los Angeles|South Central]] with his father, Jason ""Furious"" Styles Jr., hoping Tre will learn life lessons from him. Although strict, Furious is also caring and attentive.

In Crenshaw, Tre reunites with his childhood friends Darrin ""Doughboy"" Baker, Doughboy's half-brother Ricky, and their friend Chris. One night, Furious calls the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] after shooting at a burglar with his [[Colt Python|revolver]], and a civil and professional white police officer named Graham and a hostile and self-hating black police officer named Coffey arrive an hour later. The next day at Chris's suggestion, Tre and his friends go to witness a dead body, after which a group of older boys harasses them. Later on, en route back from a fishing trip, Tre and Furious notice Doughboy and Chris being arrested for theft.

Seven years later, Doughboy, now a [[Crips|Rollin 60s Crips]] member, is released from prison. Attending his welcome home party are Chris, now paraplegic due to a gunshot wound, and new friends and fellow Crip members Dookie and Monster. Ricky, now a star [[running back]] at [[Crenshaw High School]] who hopes to earn a university scholarship, lives with his mother Brenda, girlfriend Shanice, and their toddler son. A visiting USC recruiter implores him to score at least a 700 on the [[SAT]]  to qualify for the scholarship. Meanwhile, Tre, now a mature and responsible teenager, hopes to attend college with his girlfriend Brandi.

Later during a street gathering on Crenshaw Blvd, Ferris, a [[Bloods|Crenshaw Mafia Bloods]] member, provokes Ricky. Everybody comes to Ricky's defense, before Doughboy confronts Ferris and brandishes his [[Colt Double Eagle]], leading to an argument between the gangs. Cooler heads prevail until Ferris fires an automatic [[MAC-10]] into the air, forcing everybody to flee. Afterwards, Tre and Ricky are pulled over by an LAPD patrol car where Coffey threateningly holds his gun at Tre's throat. A distraught Tre ventures to Brandi's house, where he breaks down. After she comforts him, they have sexual intercourse for the first time.

The next afternoon, Brenda asks Ricky to run an errand, and Ricky encounters and brawls with Doughboy, with Brenda taking Ricky's side, and berating Doughboy. As he and Tre depart, Ricky's [[SAT]] results are delivered. The duo notice Ferris and the Bloods driving around and cut through back alleys to avoid them before splitting up; unfortunately, the Bloods approach Ricky, one of whom fatally shoots him in the leg and chest with a [[sawed off shotgun]], killing him. A distraught Doughboy helps Tre carry Ricky's bloodied corpse home; afterwards, Brenda and Shanice, both devastated by Ricky's death, tearfully blame Doughboy for instigating the shooting. Later, Brenda discovers that Ricky scored a 710, enough to qualify for the scholarship he sought.

Angered, the remaining boys vow vengeance on the Bloods. Furious finds Tre preparing to take his gun but seemingly convinces him to abandon his plans for revenge; moments later, he and Brandi catch Tre sneaking out to join Doughboy, Dookie and  Monster. Later, as the gang drives around the city, Tre comes to his senses, quits and returns home. After the gang coincidentally locates the Bloods at a local [[diner]], Monster guns down the fleeing trio with an [[AK-47]] he bought, murdering one of them by shooting him three times in the back, while Doughboy executes Ricky's killer, shooting him once in the spine, and Ferris twice in the head in a vengeful situation. Later that evening, when Tre arrives home, he and Furious silently stare at each other before entering their bedrooms for the night.

The next morning, Doughboy visits Tre, understanding Tre's reasons for abandoning the gang. Knowing he will face retaliation for killing Ferris and accepting the consequences of his crime-ridden life, Doughboy questions why most people ""don't know, don't show, or don't care about what's going on in the hood"" and laments Ricky's death. Tre embraces him as a surrogate brother.

As Doughboy leaves and Tre goes back into his house, a postscript reveals that Ricky was buried the next day, Doughboy was murdered two weeks later, and Tre ultimately attended college with Brandi in [[Atlanta]].","Crime, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--Per poster billing-->

672,Awakenings,"==Plot==
In 1969, Dr. Malcolm Sayer is a dedicated and caring physician at a local hospital in the [[The Bronx|Bronx]] borough of [[New York City]]. After working extensively with the [[catatonia|catatonic]] patients who survived the 1919–1930 epidemic of [[encephalitis lethargica]], Sayer discovers that certain stimuli will reach beyond the patients' respective catatonic states; actions, such as catching a ball, hearing familiar music, being called by their name, and enjoying human touch, all have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds. Patient Leonard Lowe seems to remain unmoved, but Sayer learns that Leonard is able to communicate with him by using a [[Ouija]] board.

After attending a lecture at a conference on the drug [[L-DOPA|<small>L</small>-DOPA]] and its success for patients with [[Parkinson's disease]], Sayer believes that the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients. A trial run with Leonard yields astounding results; Leonard completely ""awakens"" from his catatonic state. This success inspires Sayer to ask for funding from donors, so that all the catatonic patients can receive the <small>L</small>-DOPA medication and gain ""awakenings"" to reality and the present.

Meanwhile, Leonard is adjusting to his new life, and becomes romantically interested in Paula, the daughter of another hospital patient. Leonard begins to chafe at the restrictions placed on him as a patient of the hospital, desiring the freedom to come and go as he pleases. He stirs up a revolt by arguing his case to Sayer and the hospital administration. As Leonard becomes more agitated, Sayer notices that a number of [[Levodopa-induced dyskinesia|facial and body tics begin to manifest]], which Leonard has difficulty controlling.

Although Sayer and the hospital staff are thrilled by the success of <small>L</small>-DOPA with this group of patients, they soon learn that it is a temporary result. As the first to ""awaken"", Leonard is also the first to demonstrate the limited duration of this period of ""awakening"". Leonard's tics gradually grow more prominent, and he starts to shuffle as he walks. All the patients are forced to witness what will eventually happen to them. Leonard soon begins to have full body spasms and can hardly move. He tolerates the pain, and asks Sayer to film him, with the hope that he would someday contribute to research that may help others. Leonard acknowledges what is happening to him, and has a last lunch with Paula, at which he tells her that he cannot see her anymore. When he is about to leave, Paula dances with him. For this short period of time, his spasms disappear. Leonard and Sayer reconcile their differences, but Leonard soon returns to his catatonic state. The other patients' fears are similarly realized, as each eventually returns to catatonia, no matter how much their <small>L</small>-DOPA dosages are increased.

Sayer tells a group of hospital grant donors that, although the ""awakening"" did not last, another kind — one of learning to appreciate and live life — occurred. For example, he overcomes his painful shyness and asks Nurse Eleanor Costello to go out for coffee, many months after he had declined a similar invitation from her. The nurses treat the catatonic patients with more respect and care, and Paula visits Leonard. Sayer and Leonard continue to communicate with the Ouija board.","Biography, Drama",,"director       = [[Penny Marshall]]

On October 26, 1985, [[Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown]] arrives unexpectedly in the [[DeLorean time machine]]. He persuades [[Marty McFly]] and his girlfriend, [[List of Back to the Future characters|Jennifer Parker]], to travel to the future with him{{refn|group=N|As depicted at the end of ''[[Back to the Future]]'' (1985)}} and help their future children, with [[Biff Tannen]] witnessing their departure. Once they arrive in 2015, Doc incapacitates Jennifer, leaving her asleep in an alley to avoid letting her learn about her own future. Doc explains that their son Marty Jr. will be arrested for participating in a robbery with Biff's grandson [[List of Back to the Future characters|Griff]], leading to a chain of events that destroys the McFly family.

Doc instructs Marty to switch places with the identical Marty Jr. and refuse Griff's offer, but Griff goads Marty into a fight by calling him ""chicken"", and a subsequent [[hoverboard]] chase ensues. Griff and his gang are arrested, saving Marty's future children. Before rejoining Doc, Marty purchases an [[almanac]] containing the results of major sporting events from 1950 to 2000. Doc discovers it and warns Marty about profiting from time travel. Before Doc can adequately dispose of it, they are interrupted by the police, who have found Jennifer incapacitated and are taking her to her 2015 home. They pursue, as does an elderly Biff, who has overheard their conversation and retrieved the discarded almanac.

Jennifer wakes up in her 2015 home and hides from the McFly family. She overhears that her future life with Marty is not what she expected, due to his involvement in an automobile accident, and witnesses Marty being goaded by his co-worker, Douglas Needles, into a shady business deal, resulting in the loss of his job. Jennifer tries to escape the house but faints after encountering her 2015 self. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Marty and Doc, Biff steals the time machine and returns it. Marty and Doc return to 1985, leaving an unconscious Jennifer on her front porch to sleep off the day's events as a dream.

Marty gradually realizes that the 1985 they have returned to is not the one he knows. Biff, having used the almanac to secure a fortune, is now one of the country's wealthiest and most corrupt men. He has turned Hill Valley into a chaotic [[dystopia]], secretly murdered Marty's father, [[List of Back to the Future characters|George]], in 1973, and forced Marty's mother, [[List of Back to the Future characters|Lorraine]], to marry him. Meanwhile, this timeline's version of Doc has been committed to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]]. Doc deduces that old Biff took the time machine to give his younger self the almanac, and Marty learns from the alternate 1985 Biff that he received it on November 12, 1955.{{refn|group=N|The same date as the dance Marty attended in ''[[Back to the Future]]''.}} Biff, acting on his future self's advice, tries to kill Marty, but he flees with Doc to 1955.

Marty secretly follows the 1955 Biff and watches him receive the almanac from his 2015 self. Marty then follows him to the high school dance, carefully avoiding interrupting the events from his previous visit, and being forced to intervene when Biff's gang goes after the other Marty performing onstage. Marty finally gets the almanac, but loses it after being again goaded into a fight with Biff. Marty chases after Biff's car on the hoverboard, getting the almanac back as Biff is left to crash into a manure truck for the second time in a week.

Marty burns the almanac, nullifying the changes to the timeline that it had caused, as Doc hovers above in the time machine. Before Marty can join him, the DeLorean is struck by lightning and disappears. A [[Western Union]] courier arrives immediately after and delivers a letter to Marty; it is from Doc, who tells him that the lightning strike transported him seventy years in the past to 1885.{{refn|group=N|The letter's contents are later explored further in ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990)}} Marty races back into town to find the 1955 Doc, who had just helped the other Marty to return to 1985.

677,Mississippi Burning,"==Plot==
<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing. The plot summary is recommended to be between 400-700 words. -->
In 1964, three civil rights workers – two Jewish and one black – go missing while they are in Jessup County, Mississippi, organizing a voter registry for [[African Americans]]. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] sends Alan Ward and Rupert Anderson to investigate. Ward is a Northerner, senior in rank but much younger than Anderson, and approaches the investigation by the book. In contrast, Anderson, a former Mississippi sheriff, is more nuanced in his approach. The pair find it difficult to conduct interviews with the local townspeople, as Sheriff Ray Stuckey and his deputies influence the public and are linked to a branch of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].

With the help of the son of a local pastor, the FBI is finally able to bring forward a witness who saw Klansmen firebomb a house, and three white men are arrested and tried for felony arson. A local judge, however, gives the men a token suspended sentence while deriding the FBI as ""outside agitators"" who provoked the men to violence. He then releases the men, who promptly hang the witness' father and attempt to kill the witness. The FBI evacuate the family to the north and realize they will receive no help at all from local authorities.

Meanwhile, Anderson has developed a close relationship with the wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell who, in a tearful confession, reveals to Anderson that the three missing men have been murdered by her husband and his Klansmen accomplices, who then buried the bodies in an [[Embankment dam|earthen dam]]. After the bodies are discovered, revealing to the nation that the disappearance of the civil rights workers was in fact murder, Pell beats his wife brutally in retribution after discovering her betrayal.

Ward and Anderson's different approaches spill over into a physical fight which Ward wins, but he concedes that his methods have been ineffective, and he gives Anderson carte blanche authorization to deal with the problem in his own way. Anderson devises a plan to indict members of the Klan for [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] violations, instead of [[murder]], because civil rights violations are federal crimes which means that convictions for civil rights violations are more certain compared to state-level charges of murder. The FBI arranges the kidnapping of Mayor Tilman, taking him to a remote shack, where he is left with a black man who threatens to castrate him unless he speaks out. Tilman gives him a complete description of the killings, including the names of those who were involved in it. The abductor is revealed to be an FBI operative who has been assigned to intimidate Tilman. Although the obtained information is inadmissible in court because it was obtained by [[coercion]], it still proves to be valuable to the investigators.

Anderson and Ward concoct a plan, luring identified Klan collaborators to a bogus meeting, but the men soon realize that they have been set up and they leave the bogus meeting without discussing the murders. The FBI then concentrates on Lester Cowens, a Klansman of interest who exhibits a nervous demeanor, which the agents believe might yield a confession. The Feds pick him up and interrogate him. Anderson stages a tussle with Pell at the local barbershop in retaliation for the attack on his wife and takes off. Later, Cowens is at home when a shotgun blast shatters his windows. After seeing a [[burning cross]] on his lawn, he attempts to flee in his truck but is caught by several hooded men who intend to hang him. The team arrives to rescue him, having staged the entire scene where the hooded men are revealed to be other FBI agents.

Cowens, believing that his [[redneck]] brothers have threatened his life because of his admissions to the FBI, finally incriminates his accomplices. The Klansmen are charged with civil rights violations. Most of the perpetrators are convicted and are sentenced to 3–10 years imprisonment, while Sherriff Stuckey is acquitted. The FBI later finds Tilman has hanged himself, and Bird wonders why. Ward tells him Tilman was guilty, for being a witness. Mrs. Pell returns to her home, which has been completely ransacked by vandals. She resolves to stay and rebuild her life, free of her husband. Before they leave town, Anderson and Ward visit an integrated congregation, gathered at an African American cemetery, where the black civil rights activist's desecrated gravestone reads, ""Not Forgotten.""","Crime, Drama, History","starring       = {{Plainlist|

679,Evil Dead II,"==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words only. -->
[[Michigan State University]] students [[Ash Williams]] and his girlfriend, Linda, take a romantic getaway to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in it, Ash plays a tape of [[archaeologist]] Raymond Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the ""Book of the Dead"", ''[[Necronomicon Ex-Mortis]]'', which he uncovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an unseen evil force, known as the Kandarian Demon, that kills and possesses Linda, turning her into a ""deadite"". Ash decapitates Linda with a shovel and buries her in a shallow grave near the cabin. At dawn, the evil force throws Ash through the woods. He briefly becomes possessed by the demon, but when day breaks, he is inexplicably returned to normal.

He attempts to flee the area but finds that the bridge to the cabin has been destroyed. The entity chases him back to the cabin, where Linda's revived head bites his hand. He runs to the shed, where her headless body lunges at him with a chainsaw, but he overpowers and slashes the deadite Linda to death. His right hand becomes possessed and tries to kill him. Ash severs it with the chainsaw before attempting to shoot it with a shotgun, but the hand mocks him and ultimately escapes. Meanwhile, Knowby's daughter Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with the missing pages of the ''Necronomicon'', only to stumble upon the destroyed bridge. They enlist repairman Jake and his girlfriend Bobby Joe to lead them in another route to the cabin. There, they find an embattled Ash covered in blood, who accidentally shoots Bobby Joe. Deducing that he murdered Annie's parents, Annie and the others lock him in the cellar.

The four new arrivals listen to the rest of Knowby's recording, detailing his wife Henrietta's possession by the Kandarian Demon, and that he killed her before burying her in the cellar. Henrietta, now a deadite, possesses Ed, whom Ash dismembers with an axe. Bobby Joe attempts to escape through the woods when Ash's severed hand latches onto hers, but demonically possessed trees attack and drag her to her death. Annie translates two of the ''Necronomicon''{{'}}s pages before Jake turns on them and throws the pages into the cellar, forcing them at gunpoint to locate Bobby Joe. Ash becomes possessed once more and attacks Jake. Annie retreats to the cabin and accidentally stabs Jake, mistaking him for the possessed Ash, before Henrietta kills him. Deadite Ash tries to kill Annie, but returns to his normal self upon seeing Linda's necklace.

With Annie's help, Ash modifies the chainsaw, attaches it to the stump of his right arm, and [[sawn-off shotgun|cuts the shotgun's barrel]]. After finding the missing pages of the ''Necronomicon'' in the cellar, Ash kills Henrietta. The trees outside begin wrecking the cabin. Annie reveals she only read the first half of the incantation and attempts to finish the second half. As she reads it, Ash's severed hand uses a Kandarian dagger to stab her in the back. She manages to complete the incantation before succumbing to her wound. The incantation opens up a whirling temporal vortex which not only draws in the demon, but also Ash and his [[Oldsmobile Delta 88]].

Ash and his Oldsmobile land in the [[Middle Ages]]. A group of knights confront him and initially mistake him for a deadite, but are quickly distracted when a real [[harpy]]-like deadite appears. Ash blasts it with his shotgun and they hail him as a hero who has come to save them. Realizing that he was the hero prophesied in the book, Ash breaks down and screams in anguish as they hail him.","Action, Comedy, Fantasy","starring = {{Plainlist|

680,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"==Plot==
On a warm and sunny spring day in a [[Chicago]] suburb, high school senior Ferris Bueller [[Malingering|fakes illness]] to stay home from school, regularly [[Fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]]. His parents, Katie and Tom, believe he is ill, though his sister, Jeanie, does not. After learning Ferris is absent from school for the ninth time that semester, the school's [[Dean (education)|dean]], Edward Rooney, becomes determined to expose Ferris's chronic [[truancy]]; Ferris has changed his attendance records by [[Hacker|hacking]] into the school's computer system, making it appear as if he attends school regularly.

Ferris persuades his [[hypochondriac]] best friend Cameron Frye to help excuse Ferris's girlfriend Sloane Peterson from school by claiming that her grandmother has died. Cameron calls the school, pretending to be Sloane's father. Knowing Sloane is dating Ferris, Rooney is suspicious. Ferris also calls the school during Cameron's phone call to confirm his absence, thereby fooling Rooney. To complete the ruse that Sloane's father is picking her up from school, Ferris borrows the prized possession of Cameron's father, a 1961 [[Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder]]. Fearing his father's wrath, Cameron is dismayed when Ferris takes the car on a day trip into Chicago. Ferris promises they will return the car as it was, including preserving the original [[odometer]] mileage.

Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane leave the car with two parking attendants, who promptly take it on a long joyride. The trio eat lunch at an upscale restaurant, visit the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], go to a [[Chicago Cubs]] baseball game, and attend the [[Von Steuben Day]] Parade, where Ferris jumps on a [[Float (parade)|float]] and [[lip sync]]s to ""[[Danke Schoen]]"" by [[Wayne Newton]] and ""[[Twist and Shout]]"" by [[The Beatles]].

Rooney prowls the Bueller home for Ferris, becoming victim to several [[pratfall]]s. Jeanie skips class and returns home to confront Ferris, but finds Rooney instead. Shocked by his appearance, she knocks him unconscious and calls the police. Rooney regains consciousness and leaves. The police arrest Jeanie, believing she [[prank call]]ed the police station. While detained, she meets another delinquent who advises her to worry less about Ferris's exploits and more about her own life.

Upon collecting the Ferrari and heading home, Ferris and Cameron discover that the car's mileage has significantly increased. Cameron becomes semi-catatonic from shock, later almost drowning in a pool before a worried Ferris helps him. At Cameron's house, Ferris jacks up the car and runs it in reverse to [[Odometer fraud|rewind the odometer]]. However, this attempt fails and Cameron destroys the car out of anger toward his domineering father. Ferris offers to take the blame, but Cameron decides to tell the truth and stand up to his father.

After walking Sloane home, Ferris remembers his parents will be returning soon. He runs through the neighborhood, but is nearly hit by Jeanie's car as Jeanie and Katie are driving home. Katie fails to notice Ferris, though Jeanie does. Ferris makes it home first, but Rooney confronts him before he can get back inside. Seeing the two through the window, Jeanie has a change of heart and allows Ferris to come inside, claiming that Ferris was at the hospital for his illness. She also shows Rooney his wallet that had fallen from his pocket in the kitchen earlier, tosses it into a nearby puddle, and shuts the back door loud enough to wake up the family's pet [[Rottweiler]]. As Rooney flees the house, Ferris rushes back to his bedroom to await his parents. They find him in bed and believe he has been at home all day.

In a scene that plays during the [[Motion picture credits|credits]], a humiliated, disheveled, and injured Rooney reluctantly accepts a ride on a school bus filled with students who act derisively toward him. He sits next to a girl who offers him a [[gummy bear]] from her pocket, which he tosses away in disgust. Rooney glances at another student's notebook (which has ""SAVE FERRIS"" written on the cover), before glaring at the camera as the school bus drives off. In a [[post-credits scene]], Ferris looks into the camera and says, ""You're still here? It's over! Go home! Go.""",Comedy,"starring       = {{plainlist|<!--Per poster billing-->

682,The Goonies,"==Plot==
<!-- As WP:FILMPLOT requires, the plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->
Facing [[foreclosure]] of their homes in the ""Goon Docks"" area of [[Astoria, Oregon]] to an expanding [[country club]], a group of kids who call themselves ""the Goonies""—Mike “Mikey” Walsh, Richard “Data” Wang, Clark ""Mouth"" Devereaux, and Lawrence “Chunk” Cohen—gather for a final weekend together. Rummaging through Mikey's [[attic]], they come across a 1632 [[doubloon]] and an old treasure map purporting to lead to the treasure of legendary [[Piracy|pirate]] ""One-Eyed Willy"", believed to be located somewhere nearby and considered by Mikey to be the original Goonie.

Seeing the treasure as their last chance to save their homes, the kids overpower and bind Mikey's older brother, Brandon “Brand” Walsh, to get past him and make their way to an abandoned restaurant on the coast that coincides with the map. Brand soon follows alongside Andrea “Andy” Carmichael, a [[cheerleader]] with a crush on him; and her best friend Stephanie “Stef” Steinbrenner, a tomboy.

The group soon discover that the derelict restaurant is a hideout of the Fratelli [[crime family]]: Francis, Jake, and their mother. The Goonies find a tunnel in the basement and follow it, but Chunk leaves to alert the police after being locked in the freezer. Chunk flags down a nearby car to go to the sheriff's station and it turns out to be the Fratellis, who imprison him alongside their hulking and deformed younger brother Sloth. The Fratellis interrogate Chunk until he reveals where the Goonies have gone and begin pursuit. Chunk is left behind with Sloth, whom he befriends. After Sloth frees them both, Chunk calls the sheriff, who thinks it is another one of his [[tall tale]]s. Chunk and Sloth follow the trail of the Fratellis.

The Goonies evade several deadly [[booby traps]] along the tunnels, while barely staying ahead of the Fratellis. They finally reach the grotto where Willy's pirate ship, the ''Inferno'', is anchored. The group uncover the ship filled with treasure, and they start filling their pockets, but Mikey warns them not to take any on a set of scales in front of Willy's skeleton, considering that to be their tribute to him. As the Goonies are plotting their escape, the Fratellis appear and strip them of their haul. The Fratellis start to bind the Goonies' hands and make them [[Walking the plank|walk the plank]] until Chunk and Sloth arrive and distract the Fratellis long enough for the Goonies to jump overboard and swim to safety. Brand saves Andy from drowning and they kiss. The Fratellis proceed to grab all the treasure they can, including those on Willy's scales, which triggers one last booby trap, causing the grotto to cave in. With Sloth's help, the Goonies and Fratellis barely escape.

The groups emerge on Astoria's beach, where the Goonies reunite with their families and the Fratellis are arrested by the police. The Goonies prevent Sloth's arrest, and Chunk invites Sloth to live with him, which he accepts. Just as Mikey's father is about to sign the foreclosure papers, the Walshes' housekeeper, Rosalita, discovers that Mikey's marble bag is filled with some of the ship's jewels that had not been seized by the Fratellis. Mikey's father triumphantly rips up the papers, declaring that they have enough money to negate the foreclosure.

684,The Breakfast Club,"==Plot==
<!-- The plot summary should be 400–700 words. Please see WP: FILMPLOT for more information. -->
On Saturday, March 24, 1984, five students at [[Shermer High School]] in Shermer, Illinois, report for an all-day detention: socially awkward Brian Johnson (Hall), jock Andrew Clark (Estevez), shy loner Allison Reynolds (Sheedy), popular girl Claire Standish (Ringwald), and rebellious delinquent John Bender (Nelson). They gather in the school library and meet with their vice principal Richard Vernon (Gleason), who warns them not to talk or move from their seats and assigns each of them the task of writing a thousand-word essay describing ""who you think you are.""

Bender ignores the rules and spends his time antagonizing the others and defying Vernon, who gives him eight additional weekends of detention. The students sneak off to retrieve Bender's [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] stash from his locker. When they see Vernon returning to the library, Bender deliberately gets caught to allow the others to sneak back in. Locked in a storage closet as punishment, Bender is berated by Vernon even further who tells him that he wants Bender to prove how [[Machismo|tough]] he is and is offered a chance to punch Vernon but fails to act. He soon escapes into the ceiling panels and falls into the library, where the others hide him from Vernon.

The students pass the time arguing, listening to music, and smoking marijuana, gradually opening up about their home lives and their reasons for being in detention:  
* Claire's popularity subjects her to intense [[peer pressure]], while her bickering parents use her against each other. She received detention for skipping school to go shopping. 
* Bender reveals the [[physical abuse]] he and his mother suffer at the hands of his father, including [[Cigarette burns|cigar burns]], as well as other injuries he has sustained from his father physically abusing him. He is serving detention for pulling a false fire alarm. 
* Andrew became influenced by jock culture and is intimidated by his father to succeed in [[Scholastic wrestling|wrestling]]. He was given detention for taping a student's [[buttocks]] together in an attempt to win both his teammates' and his father's approval.
* Brian is under so much academic pressure from his parents to get good grades that he contemplated suicide after getting an F in [[industrial arts|shop class]]. He was sent to detention for bringing a [[flare gun]] to school.
* Allison is compulsively dishonest with [[Child neglect|neglectful]] parents, constantly stealing things to use should she ever run away from home. She admits that she showed up to detention for lack of anything better to do.

Despite their differences, the students realize they all face similar problems; Andrew and Allison bond over their complex relationships with their parents; Brian and Claire each feel anxiety over being a virgin. Still, the group suspects that their new friendships will end once detention is over. Meanwhile, Vernon complains to the janitor, Carl, that students have become less disciplined and more arrogant compared to the ones he had when he was a teacher, but Carl suggests that Vernon is the one who has changed and cares too much about what the students think of him.

The others convince Brian to complete Vernon's essay on the group's behalf. Claire gives Allison a [[makeover]], which sparks romantic interest from Andrew, and Bender crawls back to the closet, where Claire challenges her ""pristine"" reputation by kissing him. As the students part ways, Allison and Andrew kiss, and she rips the state championship patch off his letterman jacket to keep; Claire gives Bender one of her diamond earrings, and they share their own kiss.

Vernon reads Brian's essay, which asserts that the vice principal has made [[Adolescent cliques#High school cliques|petty assumptions]] about all of them and declares that ""each one of us is a brain (Brian), an athlete (Andrew), a basket case (Allison), a princess (Claire), and a criminal (Bender)."" ""Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club."" Finally, Bender walks home across the school's football field and raises his fist in the air triumphantly as he leaves.","Comedy, Drama","starring       = {{plainlist|<!--Per poster billing.

After [[Columbia University]] [[parapsychology]] professors [[Peter Venkman]], [[Ray Stantz]], and [[Egon Spengler]] experience their first encounter with a ghost at the [[New York Public Library Main Branch|New York Public Library]], the university [[Dean (education)|dean]] dismisses the credibility of their [[paranormal]]-focused research and fires them. The trio responds by establishing ""Ghostbusters"", a paranormal investigation and [[Pest control|elimination]] service operating out of a disused firehouse. They develop high-tech nuclear-powered equipment to capture and contain ghosts, although business is initially slow.

Following a paranormal encounter in her apartment, cellist Dana Barrett visits the Ghostbusters. She recounts witnessing a demonic dog-like creature in her refrigerator utter a single word: ""Zuul"". Ray and Egon research Zuul and details of Dana's building while Peter inspects her apartment and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her. The Ghostbusters are hired to remove [[Slimer|a gluttonous ghost]] from the Sedgewick Hotel. Having failed to properly test their equipment, Egon warns the group that crossing the energy streams of their [[proton pack]] weapons could cause a catastrophic explosion. They capture the ghost and deposit it in an ecto-containment unit under the firehouse. Supernatural activity rapidly increases across the city and the Ghostbusters become famous; they hire a fourth member, [[Winston Zeddemore]], to cope with the growing demand.

Suspicious of the Ghostbusters, [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] inspector Walter Peck asks to evaluate their equipment, but Peter rebuffs him. Egon warns that the containment unit is nearing capacity and supernatural energy is surging across the city. Peter meets with Dana and informs her Zuul was a [[demigod]] worshipped as a servant to ""Gozer the Gozerian"", a [[shapeshifting]] god of destruction. Upon returning home, she is possessed by Zuul; a similar entity possesses her neighbor, Louis Tully. Peter arrives and finds the possessed Dana/Zuul claiming to be ""the Gatekeeper"". Louis is brought to Egon by police officers and claims he is ""Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster"". The Ghostbusters agree they must keep the pair separated.

Peck returns with law enforcement and city workers to have the Ghostbusters arrested and their containment unit deactivated, causing an explosion that releases the captured ghosts. Louis/Vinz escapes in the confusion and makes his way to the apartment building to join Dana/Zuul. In jail, Ray and Egon reveal that [[encyc:Ivo Shandor|Ivo Shandor]], leader of a Gozer-worshipping cult in the early 20th century, designed Dana's building to function as an antenna to attract and concentrate spiritual energy to summon Gozer and bring about the apocalypse. Faced with supernatural chaos across the city, the Ghostbusters convince the mayor to release them.

The Ghostbusters travel to a hidden temple located on top of the building as Dana/Zuul and Louis/Vinz open the gate between dimensions and transform into demonic dogs. Gozer appears as a woman and attacks the Ghostbusters, then disappears when they attempt to retaliate. Her disembodied voice demands the Ghostbusters ""choose the form of the destructor"". Ray inadvertently recalls a beloved corporate mascot from his childhood, and Gozer reappears as a gigantic [[Stay Puft Marshmallow Man]] that begins destroying the city. Against his earlier advice, Egon instructs the team to cross their proton energy streams at the dimensional gate. The resulting explosion destroys Gozer's avatar, banishing it back to its dimension, and closes the gateway. The Ghostbusters rescue Dana and Louis from the wreckage and are welcomed on the street as heroes.","Action, Comedy, Fantasy","starring       = {{plainlist|

689,E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,"== Plot ==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400-700 words. -->
A race of diminutive aliens visit Earth at night to gather plant specimens in a California forest. One alien, fascinated by the distant lights of a [[San Fernando Valley]] neighborhood, separates from the group, before U.S. government agents arrive and chase the startled creature. The aliens are forced to depart before the agents can find them, leaving their lone member behind. While the agents search the forest, the creature takes shelter in a shed belonging to the family of ten-year-old Elliott Taylor. Initially scared by the creature, who runs away, Elliott spends the following day leaving  a trail of [[Reese's Pieces]] to lure it back to his home, where he hides it in his room.

The following morning, Elliott feigns illness to stay off school and play with the creature, whom he dubs E.T. Elliott eventually introduces E.T. to his older brother, Michael, and seven-year-old sister Gertie, who agree to keep him hidden from their hardworking, single mother, Mary. When the children ask about his origins, E.T. displays telekinetic abilities by levitating several balls to represent his [[planetary system]], and later demonstrates other extraordinary abilities by reviving a dead [[chrysanthemum]] and instantly healing a cut on Elliott's finger. As Elliott bonds with the creature, he begins to feel E.T.'s thoughts and emotions, being startled simultaneously with E.T. when the creature accidentally opens an umbrella in a different room.

At school, Elliott becomes intoxicated because, at home, E.T. is drinking beer and watching television. Sensing E.T.'s desire to be rescued, Elliott impulsively frees the frogs about to be [[vivisected]] in his biology class, inspiring the other children to follow his lead, and romantically kisses a girl he likes because E.T. is watching [[John Wayne]] kiss [[Maureen O'Hara]] in ''[[The Quiet Man]]'' (1952); Elliott is sent to the principal's office for his disruptive behavior. Inspired by a [[Buck Rogers]] comic strip, depicting the character calling for help with a communication device, E.T. is inspired to build a makeshift device to ""phone home"", using various parts around the Taylor home. E.T. also learns to speak English, and requests the children's help to build the device. They agree to help find the missing components, unaware that the agents have become suspicious they are harboring the alien.

On [[Halloween]], the children disguise E.T. as a ghost and Elliott sneaks it to the forest, where they set up the device to call its people. Elliott begs E.T. to stay on Earth with him, before falling asleep and waking alone in the forest the following morning. He returns home to his worried family, while Michael searches for E.T., finding him pale and weakened by a [[culvert]]. He takes E.T. home, where Elliott is also growing weaker, and reveal the creature to Mary just before government agents invade and quarantine the house. The lead agent, Keys, asks for Elliott's help to save E.T., stating that meeting aliens was his childhood dream and he considers E.T's arrival a genuine miracle. However, E.T. dies while Elliott rapidly recovers. Left alone to say goodbye, Elliott tells E.T. that he loves him, but E.T.'s heart begins to glow and he is revived and restored to health. E.T. tells Elliott that its people are returning for him.

Elliott and Michael flee with E.T. on their bikes, flanked by Michael's friends who help them evade the pursuing authorities. Heading towards a roadblock, E.T. levitates the boys to safety and lands them in the forest. E.T.'s ship arrives, and he says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, who gifts him the chrysanthemum he previously revived. Elliott tearfully asks E.T. to stay, but E.T. places his glowing finger on Elliott's head and tells him that he will always be there. The children, Mary, and Keys observe as the ship blasts off into space, leaving a rainbow in the sky.","Family, Sci-Fi","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--Per poster billing-->

<!--- PLOTS ARE GENERALLY 400-700 WORDS; CURRENT COUNT: 694-->
Ted Kramer, a [[workaholic]] advertising executive in [[New York City]], has just landed an important account and job promotion. However, when he shares the news with Joanna, his wife of eight years, she shocks him by announcing she is leaving him. She walks out of the apartment without Billy, the couple's seven-year-old son, because she feels she is unfit to be a mother. The next morning when Billy asks about his mother, Ted explains that she went away to be alone for a while. 

Ted drops Billy at his elementary school by asking him what grade he attends and leaving him with a woman at the entrance, before rushing to work. At the ad agency, Ted confides about the situation to Jim O'Connor, his boss and friend. Jim is understanding, but hopes that Ted's situation will not interfere with his new responsibility as the lead person on the Mid-Atlantic Airlines account.

Initially, Ted and Billy struggle to adapt to their new living situation as Billy misses his mother and Ted has to do the extra housework usually done by Joanna. Father and son gradually settle into a routine without Joanna, but Ted’s work suffers. Billy and Ted have a fight one evening in which Billy cries for his mother, but they later reconcile. When Billy worries his mother’s departure is his fault, Ted assures him that Joanna left because she was not happy in the marriage.

Meanwhile, Ted has become good friends with divorced neighbor Margaret Phelps, whom Joanna was confidantes with. One day, Billy has an accident when he falls off a [[jungle gym]]. Ted rushes him to the hospital, and asks the doctor to let him stay by his son's side as he receives ten stitches.

After fifteen months, Ted receives a call from Joanna and meets her at a restaurant. Joanna reveals she is happier after working in [[California]] and seeing a therapist. When she states that she is now ready to raise her son and wants Billy to come live with her, Ted becomes furious and leaves. He consults with a divorce attorney John Shaunessy, who cautions that the court usually awards custody to the mother when the child is young.

At work, Jim notifies Ted the agency is letting him go because the Mid-Atlantic Airlines executives are displeased with his work. Knowing he has no chance at custody if he is unemployed, Ted doggedly tries to land a job within twenty-four hours, despite few ad firms hiring during the holiday season. He convinces two agency executives to consider his application immediately, and accepts a lower-salaried position for which he is overqualified.

The custody hearing begins. In court, Joanna asserts that Ted never abused her or was unfaithful, but she lost her self-esteem as a stay-at-home mother. She insists she has since ""become a whole person again"" and believes her son needs her more than his father. Ted states he has proven that he can parent as well as Joanna, and insists that taking Billy away from him could cause ""irreparable"" harm.

The legal battle becomes contentious when the attorneys resort to brutal [[Character assassination|character assassinations]]. Shaunessy brings Joanna to tears by forcing her to admit that she was part of the marriage's failure. Ted also admits he made mistakes as a father and husband. However, his job loss and Billy's accident are used to discredit him. Ted expresses resentment at Joanna for her attorney's aggressive tactics. Margaret testifies on behalf of Ted and implores Joanna to recognize that he has become a great father.

Later, Ted learns Joanna was awarded custody. He decides not to appeal in order to spare Billy the burden of testifying in court. Billy becomes upset as Ted explains that they will still see each other, even though Billy will be living with his mother. On the morning Joanna is scheduled to pick up Billy, she rings the apartment building's intercom and asks to see Ted in the lobby alone. She tearfully reveals that she is relinquishing custody after realizing that she does not want to take Billy away from his home. Ted reassures her as she takes the elevator up to inform her son.",Drama,"starring       = {{plainlist|

In 1916,{{Lower-alpha explanatory footnote|The film shows a 1916 newspaper, and a scene late in the film shows American soldiers headed off for [[World War I]].}} [[Chicago]] steelworker Bill accidentally kills his factory foreman during an argument. He flees to the [[Texas Panhandle]] with his girlfriend Abby and his young sister Linda. As their train winds its way across the country, an older Linda mulls over these events in voiceover narration. She remembers that a religious man once warned her of a vision of apocalyptic hellfire, and notes that at the [[Last Judgment]], God will rescue the good and turn away the evil.

In Texas, a wealthy farmer suffering from an unspecified malady hires as many seasonal [[Stook|shockers]] as he can find, including Bill and Abby, who pretend to be siblings to deter gossip. The farmer and his aging foreman work the shockers hard, and turn a profit of over $100,000 (about $3 million in 2024 dollars). Bill envies the farmer's wealth; as Linda remarks, workers in Chicago often live in poverty. Bill overhears a doctor telling the farmer that he has one year left to live. The farmer's accountant encourages him to sell his farm and enjoy his profits, but the farmer recklessly insists on staying.

The dying farmer takes a liking to the beautiful Abby, and asks her to stay with him after the harvest. Bill encourages Abby to marry the farmer so that they can inherit his money when he dies. Abby reminds Bill that she is in love with him, not the farmer, and questions whether Bill still loves her. Bill confidently predicts that the farmer will die soon and they will be reunited. Despite the questionable ethics of his proposal, he rationalizes that when he and Abby are rich, ""who's gonna care that we acted perfect?""

Abby marries the farmer. She persuades him to let Bill and Linda stay at the farmhouse. The foreman suspects that Abby and Bill are con artists, but the farmer dismisses the suggestion and distances himself from the foreman.

Surprisingly, the farmer's health remains stable, foiling Bill's plans. Over time, the shy farmer wins over Abby with his genuine disposition. However, he grows suspicious of Abby's excessively familiar relationship with her ""brother."" Bill belatedly realizes that Abby has fallen in love with the farmer. He realizes that the only way to salvage the situation is to leave the farm, leaving his little sister with his ex-girlfriend. The farmer coldly watches him go. With Bill gone, the situation becomes less tense. The farmer tries to be a good father figure to Linda. In voiceover, the present-day Linda wonders whether the devil ruined Bill's plans to punish his greed.

Bill courts disaster by returning to the farm during the following year's harvest. He admits to Abby that encouraging her to marry another man was a mistake and that he is to blame. His timing is poor, as a [[Locust|locust swarm]]—reminiscent of a [[Plague of locusts|Biblical plague]]—soon arrives, threatening to destroy the entire harvest. The farmer lights [[Controlled burn|controlled fires]] to try to smoke out the locusts. However, when he sees Bill, he loses control of himself and furiously chases after Bill with a gun. The farmer knocks over one of his fire lamps in the process, triggering a widespread blaze that destroys much of the harvest. Bill kills the farmer with a screwdriver.

Once again, Bill, Abby, and Linda are on the run, leaving them no better off than they were the year before. With the foreman's help, the police find the group and shoot Bill as he tries to escape. Seeking a new life, Abby leaves Linda at a boarding school and departs on a train with soldiers headed for [[World War I]]. 

In the final scene, Linda runs away from school with a friend from the farm, with no real idea of what to do next. The present-day Linda continues narrating as the screen fades out, implying that her story will continue, but this part of her life is now over.","Drama, Romance","starring       = {{ubl|[[Richard Gere]]|[[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]]|[[Sam Shepard]]|[[Linda Manz]]}}

692,The Outlaw Josey Wales,"==Plot==

During the [[American Civil War]], the wife and son of [[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]] farmer [[Josey Wales (character)|Josey Wales]] are murdered by [[Jayhawker|pro-Union paramilitaries]] led by the brutal Captain Terrill. After burying their corpses, Wales seeks vengeance for his family by joining a group of Confederate [[bushwhacker]]s under the command of [[William T. Anderson]], attacking the [[Union Army]] and pro-Union sympathizers. After the war ends in 1865, Wales' superior Captain Fletcher persuades his men to surrender, having been promised amnesty by Union General [[Jim Lane (politician)|Jim Lane]]. However, Terrill's men massacre the bushwhackers after they surrender, with Wales, Fletcher and fellow bushwhacker Jamie being the only survivors. Wales and Jamie flee, and Lane forces Fletcher to assist Terrill in hunting them down. A mortally wounded Jamie helps Wales kill two [[bounty hunter]]s before dying.

With a $5,000 bounty on his head, Wales flees to [[Texas]]. He meets elderly [[Cherokee]] man Lone Watie on the way, who informs Wales that Confederate General [[Joseph O. Shelby]] is fleeing to [[Mexico]] and suggests they do likewise. Wales subsequently rescues young [[Navajo]] woman Little Moonlight and kills another bounty hunter. Alongside Little Moonlight, Wales also rescues an elderly [[Kansas|Kansan]] woman Sarah Turner and her granddaughter Laura Lee from marauding [[Comanchero]]s. At the town of Santo Rio, two employees of Turner's dead son Tom, Travis and Chato, also join the group. Wales and his companions find Tom's abandoned [[ranch]] and settle down there. Discovering that Travis and Chato have been kidnapped by [[Comanche]] chief [[Ten Bears]], Wales rides into his camp and negotiates the return of the two men; an impressed Ten Bears becomes [[blood brother]]s with Wales.

A bounty hunter whose partner was killed by Wales at Santo Rio guides Terrill and his men to the town. On the following morning, Terrill's men launch a surprise attack on the ranch, but Wales' companions manage to gun them all down. A wounded and ammunitionless Wales follows the fleeing Terrill back to Santo Rio, where he corners him. A wounded Terrill attempts to draw his sabre but Wales grabs his hand and forces the blade through Terrill's chest, killing him. Returning to the town [[Western saloon|saloon]], Wales discovers its patrons telling Fletcher, accompanied by two [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], that an outlaw named Josey Wales was recently killed in [[Monterrey]] by five gunmen. The Rangers accept the story and leave, while Fletcher pretends not to recognize Wales and tells him he will go to Mexico himself to look for Wales and tell him the war is over. Wales responds by stating that ""I reckon so. I guess we all died a little in that damned war"" before riding off into the sunset.",Western,"starring       = {{Plainlist|

Harry Caul, a surveillance expert in [[San Francisco]], specializes in [[wiretapping]] services. He and his team are hired by a client, who identifies himself as ""the Director"", to eavesdrop on a couple walking through [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]]. Despite the background noise, Caul filters and merges the tapes to create a clear recording with ambiguous meaning. Caul is intensely private, obsessively guarding his own personal life, haunted by guilt from a past job that resulted in three deaths.

Despite Caul's insistence that he is not responsible for how his clients use the surveillance, he is troubled by guilt and his [[Catholic church|Catholic]] faith. When he discovers a potentially dangerous phrase in the recording, ""He'd kill us if he got the chance,"" Caul becomes increasingly paranoid. His attempt to deliver the recording is thwarted, and he believes he is being followed and tricked.

After a party at his workshop, Caul spends the night with a woman, Meredith, and the tapes are stolen. He receives a call from Martin Stett, the Director's assistant, informing him that they have the tapes, and that the Director couldn't wait any longer, so Caul must also deliver the pictures taken, and collect his money in a meeting with them, that same day. In that meeting, Caul learns that the woman in the recording is the Director's wife, involved in an affair. Caul, suspecting murder, books a hotel room next to the one mentioned in the recording, and overhears a heated argument. Convinced he has overheard a murder, Caul breaks into the room; he initially finds no evidence, until he flushes the toilet and finds it clogged and overflowing with blood.

Attempting to confront the Director, Caul discovers the wife is alive and unharmed, as is her lover. A newspaper headline reveals an executive's supposed death in a car accident, leading Caul to realize that the couple actually murdered the Director. He missed the emphasis on ""us"" in the recording, not only signifying the couple's fear of being killed by the Director if he discovered the affair, but also their own plan to murder him first.

Stett calls Caul at his apartment, and warns him not to investigate, playing a recording of Caul's saxophone to prove they are listening. Caul frantically searches for bugs in his apartment, destroying nearly everything in it. In the end, Caul sits alone amid the wreckage, playing his saxophone.","Drama, Mystery, Thriller","starring       = {{Plain list|

Charlie Bucket, a poor [[paperboy]], passes [[Willy Wonka]]'s chocolate factory, where a [[tinker]] tells him that nobody ever enters or leaves the building. Charlie's Grandpa Joe reveals that Wonka had shut down the factory due to espionage from rival confectioners; production resumed three years later, but the factory remained closed to the public and the new workers are unknown.

Wonka announces that he has hidden five Golden Tickets in [[Wonka Bar]]s; the finders of the tickets will receive a tour of the factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate. The first four tickets are found by gluttonous Augustus Gloop, spoiled Veruca Salt, gum-chewer Violet Beauregarde, and television-obsessed Mike Teevee. A mysterious man is seen whispering to each winner. 

On the day before the factory tour, Charlie finds money in a gutter and uses it to buy a Wonka Bar that contains the fifth ticket. On his way home, he encounters the man who spoke to the other winners. Introducing himself as Arthur Slugworth, one of Wonka's competitors, the man offers Charlie a large monetary reward in exchange for a sample of Wonka's new invention, the [[Everlasting Gobstopper]]. Arriving home with the Golden Ticket, Charlie chooses Grandpa Joe as his chaperone. 

The next day, Wonka greets the children at the front gates of the factory and leads them inside, where they are made to sign a contract. The tour begins in the Chocolate Room, where the visitors meet Wonka's workforce: little people known as [[Oompa-Loompas]]. The children receive Everlasting Gobstoppers in the Inventing Room. One by one, each child is expelled from the tour except for Charlie: Augustus is sucked up a pipe after falling into the Chocolate River, Violet chews an experimental gum and swells into a giant human blueberry, Veruca falls down a garbage chute in the Egg Room, and Mike is shrunk to the size of a chocolate bar after misusing the Wonkavision teleporter. At one point, Charlie and Grandpa Joe sample Fizzy Lifting Drinks, causing them to float dangerously close to a fan; they descend safely by burping.

When the tour is over, Wonka refuses to give Charlie and Grandpa Joe their chocolate prize on the grounds that they violated the contract by taking the Fizzy Lifting Drinks. Grandpa Joe plans to give the Gobstopper to Slugworth out of spite, but Charlie chooses to return it instead. Wonka declares Charlie the winner of the contest, revealing that ""Slugworth"" is actually one of his employees, and that the offer to buy the Gobstopper from the kids was a test of character. As the three fly over the town in the Wonkavator, a multi-directional glass elevator, Wonka explains that he created the contest to find a worthy successor and invites Charlie and his family to come and live in the factory.","Family, Fantasy, Musical","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--Per billing block.-->

In an attempt to make money, Joe receives [[oral sex]] from a meek young man in a movie theater, but the man cannot pay. Joe threatens him, but releases him unharmed. The next day, Joe spots Rico at a diner, and angrily confronts him. Rico manages to calm Joe, and invites him to share his squalid, condemned apartment [[squatting|squat]]. Joe reluctantly accepts, and the two begin a ""business relationship"" as hustlers. Rico asks Joe to call him ""Rico"" instead of ""Ratso"", but Joe does not oblige. They struggle with severe poverty, stealing food and failing to get work for Joe. Joe pawns his radio and sells his blood, while Rico's persistent cough worsens during a winter without heat in the freezing apartment.

In intermittent [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], Joe's grandmother raises him after his mother abandons him. He has a tragic relationship with Annie, disclosed through hazy flashbacks in which they are attacked and raped by a cowboy gang. Annie shows signs of mental trauma and is taken into an ambulance.

Rico tells Joe his father was an illiterate Italian immigrant [[shoeshiner]] whose job yielded a bad back and lung damage from inhaling [[shoe polish]]. Rico learned shoeshining from his father, but considers it degrading and generally refuses to do it. When he breaks into a stand and shines Joe's cowboy boots to attract clients, two police officers arrive and sit with their dirty boots next to Joe's. Rico dreams of escaping to [[Miami]], shown in fantasies in which he and Joe frolic on a beach and are pampered at a resort, including a boy polishing Rico's boots.

A [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]]-like filmmaker and an extrovert female artist approach Joe in a diner, taking his photograph and inviting him to a [[The Factory|Warhol-esque]] art event.{{efn|This sequence incorporates actual [[Warhol superstars]] [[Viva (actress)|Viva]], [[Isabelle Collin Dufresne|Ultra Violet]], [[Taylor Mead]], [[Joe Dallesandro]], and filmmaker [[Paul Morrissey]].<ref>Blake Gopnik, Warhol:  A Life as Art London: Allen Lane. March 5, 2020. {{ISBN|978-0-241-00338-1}} p. 629</ref>}} Joe and Rico attend, but Rico's poor health and hygiene attract unwanted attention. After mistaking a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]] for a cigarette and receiving [[Stimulant|uppers]], Joe hallucinates. He leaves with Shirley, a [[socialite]] who pays him $20 for spending the night, but Joe cannot perform sexually. They play [[Scribbage]], and the resulting wordplay leads Shirley to suggest that Joe may be gay; suddenly, he is able to perform. The next morning, she sets up her female friend as Joe's client, and at last his career appears to be progressing.

When Joe returns to the apartment, Rico is severely feverish. He refuses medical help, and begs Joe to put him on a bus to [[Florida]]. Desperate for cash, Joe picks up an effeminate middle-aged man in an arcade. The two return to the man's hotel room, where Joe demands money. However, when the man refuses to give him more than $10, Joe brutally beats, robs, and apparently [[Smothered|smothers]] him. Joe buys two bus tickets to Florida with the stolen cash. Rico again tells Joe that he wants to be called ""Rico"", not ""Ratso"", and Joe finally begins to oblige. During the bus trip, Rico's health worsens, and he suffers from [[urinary incontinence]].

Joe buys new clothing for Rico and himself at a rest stop, discarding his cowboy outfit and boots. Back on the bus, Joe muses that there must be an easier way to make money than hustling, and tells Rico that he will get a regular job in Miami. When he does not respond, Joe realizes that Rico has died. Joe alerts the bus driver, who asks Joe to close Rico's eyelids, saying that they will soon be in Miami. The other passengers stare. With tears in his eyes, Joe sits with his arm around his dead friend as the bus continues past rows of Floridian [[palm tree]]s.",Drama,"starring       = {{Plainlist|

702,Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"==Plot==
In 1967, Joanna Drayton, a 23-year-old white woman, returns from her Hawaiian vacation to her parents' home in San Francisco with Dr. John Prentice, a 37-year-old black widower. The couple became engaged after a 10-day romance. Joanna's parents are Matt Drayton, a newspaper editor, and his wife, Christina, who owns an art gallery. Though the Draytons are liberal-minded, they are shocked that their daughter is engaged to a man of a different race. Christina gradually accepts the situation, but Matt objects because of the likely unhappiness and seemingly insurmountable problems the couple will face.

Unbeknownst to Joanna, John tells the Drayton parents he will withdraw from the engagement unless both Draytons give the couple their blessing. To complicate matters, John is soon scheduled to [[Geneva]], Switzerland, for three months in his work with the [[World Health Organization]]. His answer from the Draytons will determine whether Joanna follows him. Joanna invites John's parents to fly up from Los Angeles to join them for dinner that evening. John has not told them his fiancée is white. Monsignor Mike Ryan, Matt's golf buddy, arrives and tells Matt and the couple that he is supportive of the engagement. Christina tells Matt she, too, is supportive of Joanna, even if it means fighting Matt. Christina fires her bigoted art gallery manager, Hilary St. George, who nosily intrudes and voices her sympathy for Christina's situation.

John's parents, the Prentices, arrive and are shocked to discover that Joanna is white.  The two mothers agree that this was an unexpected event but support their children. The two fathers meet, expressing disapproval at this unhappy occasion. The Monsignor advises John not to withdraw, despite Matt's objections. John and his father discuss their generational differences. John's mother tells Matt that he and her husband have forgotten what it was like to fall in love, and their failure to remember true romance has clouded their thinking. John chides Matt for not having the ""guts"" to tell him he disapproved of the marriage. Finally, Matt reveals his decision about the engagement to the entire group. He concludes that he does remember what true romance is. He says although the pair face enormous problems, they must find a way to overcome them, and he will approve the marriage, knowing all along he had no right to stop it. The families and the Monsignor then adjourn to the dining room for dinner.","Comedy, Drama","starring       = {{plainlist|

713,Shadow of a Doubt,"==Plot==
The film opens on Charles Oakley smoking in bed surrounded by money. His landlady announces he had two visitors. Charles spots them outside and lures them to an abandoned building where he gives them the slip. He telegraphs his sister in [[Santa Rosa, California]] to let her know he will visit.

His niece Charlotte ""Charlie"" Newton is bored with her family's routine and decides to telegraph Uncle Charlie (her [[eponym]]) and ask for a visit. She is thrilled to learn he is already on his way and feels they are linked by a kind of [[telepathy]]. The Newtons are delighted at Uncle Charlie's company. He has extravagant gifts for everyone: a watch for his brother-in-law, a fur for his sister, and an emerald ring for his niece. Young Charlie notices the ring is engraved with someone else's initials. Uncle Charlie explains the jeweler must have rooked him.

Two men soon appear at the Newton home pretending to survey middle class homes. They go to great lengths to take Uncle Charlie's picture. Young Charlie guesses they are undercover detectives. They explain her uncle is one of two suspects in a nationwide manhunt. Charlie refuses to believe it at first, but learns that the initials engraved inside her emerald ring match one of the victims of the ""Merry Widow Murderer"". She eyes her uncle with growing suspicion and dread.

During one dinner, Uncle Charlie lets his guard down and rants about rich widows, describing them as ""fat, wheezing animals"". Horrified, young Charlie runs out of the room. Uncle Charlie follows her and takes her into a seedy bar. He admits he is one of the two murder suspects and begs for help. She reluctantly agrees not to say anything. She is desperate to avoid a disgrace that would destroy her mother, who adores her younger brother.

[[File:Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten in Shadow of a Doubt trailer.png|thumb|left|267px|Uncle Charlie ([[Joseph Cotten]]) confronts his niece ([[Teresa Wright]]) in a seedy bar about what she knows.]]

News breaks that the other Merry Widow suspect was chased by police and killed. Everyone assumes he was the actual murderer. Uncle Charlie is delighted to be off the hook, but young Charlie still suspects him. Not long afterward, she falls down the back porch stairs, which she discovers were deliberately cut through. Meanwhile, the detectives confide in young Charlie that the picture they took of her uncle has been sent east for identification by a witness.

Uncle Charlie reveals he wants to settle down in Santa Rosa. Young Charlie is appalled, but her uncle reminds her there is no proof he is a killer. He has even taken back the emerald ring with the initials. Young Charlie says she will kill him if he stays. Later that night, Uncle Charlie leaves the car idling in the garage and traps Young Charlie inside. A neighbor hears her struggling and alerts the Newtons. Uncle Charlie makes a show of saving her.

Young Charlie finds the emerald ring in her uncle's room and puts it on. When Uncle Charlie sees it on her finger, he abruptly announces he is leaving for San Francisco – coincidentally on the same train as Mrs. Porter, a rich widow. At the station, Uncle Charlie invites his niece onboard to see his compartment. When the train starts to move, he stops her from leaving and explains he has to kill her because she knows too much. Just before Young Charlie is thrown out, she manages to reverse positions with her uncle, and he falls into the path of an oncoming train.

At his funeral, Uncle Charlie is sentimentally honored by the townspeople. Young Charlie laments with one of the detectives that they know he was actually the Merry Widow Murderer. They resolve to keep Uncle Charlie's crimes a secret.","Film-Noir, Thriller","starring       = {{plainlist|

715,The Lady Vanishes,"==Plot==
After visiting the fictional country of Bandrika, English tourist Iris Henderson is returning home to get married, but an avalanche blocks the railway line. The stranded passengers are forced to spend the night at a hotel. In the same predicament are [[Charters and Caldicott]], [[cricket]] enthusiasts anxious to see the last days of a [[Test cricket|Test match]] in [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Manchester]], and Miss Froy, a governess and music teacher. Miss Froy listens to a folk singer in the street, but he is strangled to death by an unseen murderer.

That evening, Iris is bothered by a loud noise from the room above hers. It is caused by Gilbert Redman, an [[ethnomusicologist]] who plays the clarinet for local folk dancers. She attempts to get him removed from the room, but fails after he confronts her.

The next morning at the railway station, Iris is attempting to return Miss Froy's glasses when she is hit on the head by a large planter dropped from above. Miss Froy helps her onto the train. Also on board are Charters and Caldicott, Gilbert, lawyer Eric Todhunter and his mistress, who is passing herself off as ""Mrs. Todhunter."" Iris faints and then comes to in a compartment with Miss Froy and several strangers. She joins Miss Froy in the dining car for tea. Soon after, they return to their compartment, where Iris falls asleep.

When Iris wakes up, Miss Froy has vanished, and the other passengers in the compartment and some of the train staff deny having seen her. Todhunter pretends not to remember her to avoid drawing attention to his liaison with his mistress. Iris searches for Miss Froy with Gilbert's assistance. Brain surgeon Dr. Hartz says Iris may be suffering from ""concussion-related hallucinations."" Fearing that any delay would make them miss the cricket match, Charters and Caldicott also claim not to remember Miss Froy.

[[File:The Lady Vanishes 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|From left, Catherine Lacey, Margaret Lockwood and Michael Redgrave with the bandaged patient]]
Angry at her lover for his reluctance to pursue a divorce, Todhunter's mistress admits to seeing Miss Froy. At the first stop, Dr. Hartz's patient, whose head is completely covered in bandages, is brought aboard on a stretcher and accompanied by an apparently deaf-mute nun. A woman dressed exactly like Miss Froy, Madame Kummer, appears in her place and claims to have helped Iris after she was struck on the head. Now concerned about potential scandal, Todhunter's mistress says Madame Kummer was the woman she saw. Waiting in the corridor while one of the cooks tosses trash out the window, Gilbert sees a wrapper from Miss Froy's personal tea package, which briefly sticks to a window, convincing him of her existence.

While continuing their search, Iris and Gilbert find Miss Froy's glasses in the baggage car. However, they are attacked by magician Signor Doppo who was in Iris's compartment. They lose the glasses in the struggle and Doppo escapes. Iris notices that the nun accompanying Dr. Hartz's patient is wearing high heels, and they suspect that patient has been replaced by Miss Froy. Dr. Hartz shares a drink with them in the dining car and takes them back to a compartment, where he admits that he is involved in the conspiracy and tells them they have been drugged. However the false nun, revealed to be a British woman in costume, did not put the drug into their drinks out of loyalty to her fellow countrymen. Gilbert and Iris escape, free Miss Froy and replace her with Madame Kummer.

When the train stops near the border, Dr. Hartz discovers the switch. He has part of the train diverted onto a branch line, where soldiers wait. Gilbert and Iris inform their fellow passengers what is happening. A uniformed soldier boards and requests that they all accompany him. They knock him out and take his pistol. Another soldier fires, wounding Charters in the hand.

During the ensuing gunfight, Miss Froy tells Gilbert and Iris that she must get away as she is actually a spy. Just in case, she gives them a message (encoded in a tune) to deliver to the [[Foreign Office]] in [[Whitehall]]—the same tune that the murdered street musician performed for her. Miss Froy then runs into the forest, and those on the train are not sure whether or not she is shot. Todhunter attempts to surrender, waving a white handkerchief, and is shot dead. Gilbert and Caldicott commandeer the locomotive, but the knocked out soldier wakes up and threatens the rest of the guests. The false nun escapes through a side door and switches the tracks but is shot in the leg; however, Caldicott and Gilbert manage to pull her up into the train before she is left behind.

In London, Charters and Caldicott discover the Test Match has been cancelled due to flooding. Seeing her fiancé from a distance, Iris jumps into a cab with Gilbert, who kisses her. They arrive at the Foreign Office, but in the waiting room Gilbert realizes he cannot remember the vital tune. As they are led into the office, Gilbert and Iris hear it. The doors open, revealing Miss Froy playing the tune on a piano.","Mystery, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist|

716,Bringing Up Baby,"==Plot==
David Huxley is a mild-mannered [[Paleontology|paleontologist]]. For the past four years, he has been assembling the skeleton of a ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' but is missing one bone: the ""intercostal [[clavicle]].""  Adding to his stress is his impending marriage to Alice Swallow and the need to impress Elizabeth Random, who is considering a million-dollar donation to his museum.

The day before his wedding, David meets Susan Vance by chance on a golf course. She plays his ball, but she is oblivious to the fact that she has made a mistake. Susan is a free-spirited, somewhat scatterbrained, young lady, unfettered by logic. These qualities soon embroil David in several frustrating incidents.

Susan's brother Mark has sent her a tame [[leopard]] named Baby from [[Brazil]]. Its tameness is helped by hearing the song ""[[I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby]]"". Susan thinks David is a [[zoologist]], and manipulates him into accompanying her in taking Baby to her farm in Connecticut. Complications arise when Susan falls in love with him, and she tries to keep him at her house as long as possible, even hiding his clothes, to prevent his imminent marriage.

David's prized intercostal clavicle is delivered, but Susan's aunt's dog George takes it and buries it somewhere. When Susan's aunt arrives, she discovers David in a negligee. To David's dismay, she turns out to be Elizabeth Random. A second message from Mark makes clear the leopard is for Elizabeth, as she always wanted one. Baby and George, who have befriended one another, run off. The zoo is called to help capture Baby. Susan and David race to find Baby before the zookeepers do and, mistaking a dangerous leopard from a nearby circus for Baby, they let it out of its cage.

[[File:Grant Hepburn Bringing up baby.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn in adjacent jail cells|David and Susan in jail]]
David and Susan are jailed by a befuddled town policeman, Constable Slocum, for acting strangely at the house of Dr. Fritz Lehman, where they have cornered the circus leopard, thinking it is Baby. When Slocum does not believe their story, Susan tells him they are members of the ""Leopard Gang""; she calls herself ""Swingin' Door Susie,"" and David ""Jerry the Nipper.""{{Efn|""Jerry the Nipper"" was Irene Dunne's character's nickname for Grant's character in ''[[The Awful Truth]]'', which also featured Asta}}  Eventually, when everyone's identity has been cleared up, Susan
(who earlier escaped out a window) returns, dragging a leopard on a rope. When it is revealed that this is not Baby but the highly irritated circus leopard, David saves Susan, using a chair to shoo the big cat into a cell.

Some time later, Susan finds David, who has been jilted by Alice because of her, on a high platform working on his ''Brontosaurus'' reconstruction at the museum. After showing him the missing bone which she found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur to be closer to him. She tells David that her aunt has given her the million dollars, and she wants to donate it to the museum, but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent with her was the best day of his life. They declare their love for each other, and Susan, distracted by the moment, unconsciously swings the ladder from side to side. As they talk, and the ladder sways more and more with each swing, Susan and David finally notice that Susan is in danger. Frightened, she climbs onto the skeleton, eventually causing it to collapse. David grabs her hand before she falls, lifts her onto the platform, and halfheartedly complains about the loss of his years of work on his ''Brontosaurus'' as she talks him into forgiving her. Resigning himself to a future of chaos, David embraces and kisses Susan.","Comedy, Family, Romance","starring       = {{ubl|[[Katharine Hepburn]]|[[Cary Grant]]|[[Charles Ruggles]]|[[Barry Fitzgerald]]|[[May Robson]]|[[Walter Catlett]]|[[Fritz Feld]]}}

717,Bride of Frankenstein,"==Plot==
In a castle on a stormy night, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and [[Lord Byron]] praise [[Mary Shelley]] for her story of Frankenstein and his Monster. She reminds them that her intention for writing the novel was to impart a moral lesson, the consequences of a mortal man who tries to [[wikt:play God|play God]]. Mary says she has more of the story to tell. The scene shifts to the close of the 1931 movie ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]],'' where villagers gathered around the burning windmill cheer the apparent death of the Monster.

Hans, the father of [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|a girl the creature drowned]], wants to see the Monster's bones. He falls into a flooded pit underneath the mill, where the Monster—having survived the fire—strangles him. Hauling himself from the pit, the Monster casts Hans' wife to her death. He next encounters Frankenstein's servant Minnie, who flees in terror.

The body of [[Victor Frankenstein|Henry Frankenstein]], who is thought to have died at the windmill, is returned to his fiancée Elizabeth at his castle home. Minnie arrives to sound the alarm about the Monster, but her warning goes unheeded. Elizabeth, seeing Henry move, realizes he is still alive. Nursed back to health by Elizabeth, Henry has renounced his creation, but still believes he may be destined to unlock the secret of life and immortality. A hysterical Elizabeth cries that she foresees death.

Henry visits the lab of his former mentor [[Doctor Septimus Pretorius]], where Pretorius shows Henry several [[Homunculus|homunculi]] he has created. Pretorius wishes to work with Henry to create a mate for the Monster, with the proposed venture involving Pretorius growing an artificial brain while Henry gathers parts for the mate.

The Monster saves a young shepherdess from drowning. Her screams upon seeing the Monster alert two hunters, who shoot and injure him. The hunters raise a mob that sets out in pursuit. Captured and trussed to a pole, the Monster is hauled to a dungeon and chained. Left alone, he breaks his chains, overpowers the guards, and escapes into the woods.

That night, the Monster encounters an old blind [[hermit]] who thanks God for sending him a friend. He teaches the monster words like ""friend"" and ""good"" and shares a meal with him. Two lost hunters stumble upon the cottage and recognize the Monster. He attacks them and accidentally burns down the cottage as the hunters lead the hermit away.

Taking refuge from another angry mob in a crypt, the Monster spies Pretorius and his cronies Karl and Ludwig breaking open a grave. The henchmen depart as Pretorius has supper. The Monster reveals himself, eats some of the food, and learns that Pretorius plans to create a mate for him.

Henry and Elizabeth, now married, are visited by Pretorius. Henry expresses his refusal to assist Pretorius, who calls the Monster. The Monster demands Henry's help, to no avail. Pretorius orders the Monster out, secretly signaling him to kidnap Elizabeth. Pretorius guarantees her safe return upon Henry's participation. Henry returns to his tower laboratory and, despite himself, grows excited over his work. After being assured of Elizabeth's safety, Henry completes the [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|Bride]]'s body.

A storm rages as final preparations are made to bring the Bride to life. Her bandage-wrapped body is raised through the roof, where electricity is harnessed from lightning to animate her. Henry and Pretorius lower her and, after realizing their success in bringing her to life, remove her bandages and help her to stand.

The Monster comes down the steps after killing Karl on the rooftop and sees his mate. The Monster reaches out to her and asks: ""Friend?"" The Bride, screaming, rejects him. He observes: ""She hate me! Like others."" As Elizabeth races to Henry's side, the Monster rampages through the lab. Before destroying everything, the Monster pauses and tells Henry and Elizabeth: ""Go! You live! Go!"" To Pretorius and the Bride, he says: ""You stay. We belong dead."" While Henry and Elizabeth flee, the Bride hisses at the Monster. Shedding a tear, the Monster pulls a lever to trigger the laboratory and tower's destruction.","Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi","starring       = {{Plainlist|

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->
After fighting organized crime as [[Deadpool]] for two years, [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Wade Wilson]] fails to kill one of his targets on his anniversary with his girlfriend, [[Vanessa Carlysle (film character)|Vanessa]]. That night, after the pair decides to start a family together, the target tracks Wade down and inadvertently kills Vanessa; Wade then kills him in revenge. Six weeks later, Wade is still wallowing in self-hatred. He visits Blind Al, where she unsuccessfully attempts to convince him to move on with his life. After a series of failed attempts to commit suicide, Wade has a vision of Vanessa in the afterlife but remains alive due to his healing abilities. Wade is left with only a [[Skee-Ball]] token and an anniversary gift, as final mementos of Vanessa.

[[Piotr Rasputin (film character)|Colossus]] recovers Wade's body and takes him to the [[X-Mansion]] to recruit him. Wade reluctantly agrees to join the [[X-Men]] because he believes Vanessa would have wanted him to. He, Colossus, and [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead (film character)|Negasonic Teenage Warhead]] respond to a standoff between authorities and the unstable young mutant [[Rusty Collins|Russell Collins]] at an orphanage owned by the [[Mister Sinister|Essex Corporation]], labeled a ""Mutant Re-education Center"". Realizing that Russell has been abused by the orphanage staff, Wade kills one of the staff members before being restrained by Colossus, and both Wade and Russell are arrested. Fitted with power-suppressing collars, they are taken to the Ice Box, an isolated prison for mutant criminals. Meanwhile, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], a cybernetically enhanced soldier from the future, travels back in time to kill Russell.

Cable storms the Ice Box and attacks Russell. Wade, whose collar breaks in the ensuing melee, attempts to protect Russell. After Cable takes Vanessa's token, Wade forces himself and Cable out of the prison, but not before Russell overhears Wade denying that he cares for the lad. Near death again, Wade has another vision of Vanessa in which she convinces him to help Russell. 

Deadpool organizes a team he calls [[X-Force]] to free Russell from a prison transfer convoy and protect him from Cable. The team launches its assault on the convoy by parachute, but all members die during the landing except for Wade and [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], whose main superpower she claims to be pure luck. While a fight with Cable distracts them, Russell frees fellow inmate [[Juggernaut (character)|Juggernaut]], who agrees to help him kill the abusive orphanage headmaster. Juggernaut destroys the convoy, rips Wade in half, and escapes alongside Russell.

While Wade recovers, Cable offers to work with him and Domino to stop Russell from killing the headmaster.  Cable explains that in his timeline, after Russell kills the headmaster, he becomes a [[serial killer]] who slaughters Cable's family. Wade accepts Cable's offer, on the condition that Cable gives him a chance to change Russell's mind. At the orphanage, however, Deadpool and team are overpowered by Juggernaut, while Russell pursues the headmaster. Colossus, having initially refused to help out, due to Wade's murderous ways, arrives to distract Juggernaut. Wade fails to placate Russell, forcing Cable to shoot at the boy. Wade leaps in front of the bullet while wearing the Ice Box collar and dies, reuniting with Vanessa in the afterlife. His sacrifice dissuades Russell from killing the headmaster and, consequently, saves Cable's family. Cable uses his last charge, reserved for his return trip to his family, to warp back several minutes, strapping Vanessa's token in front of Wade's heart so he survives the bullet. Cable then decides to stay in the present for a while to help improve the world, knowing that his family will be safe in the future. Afterward, the headmaster is run over and killed by Wade's taxi driver friend [[Dopinder]].

In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits sequence]] Negasonic and her girlfriend [[Yukio (film character)|Yukio]] repair Cable's time-traveling device for Wade. He uses it to save the lives of Vanessa and X-Force member Peter, as well as to kill both [[X-Men Origins: Wolverine|an alternate version of himself confronting Wolverine]], and [[Ryan Reynolds]] after he finishes reading the screenplay for ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]''.","Action, Adventure, Comedy","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!-- ORDER PER BILLING BLOCK -->

725,Get Out,"==Plot==
On a suburban street at night, a black man walks alone, talking on the phone. A car pulls up to the curb beside him; sensing trouble, he starts to walk away. Suddenly, a person wearing a helmet that conceals their face tackles him to the ground, subdues him, and drags him into the car, which drives off into the night.

Twenty-six-year-old Chris Washington, a black photographer, travels to [[upstate New York]] for a weekend getaway to meet the family of his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage. He has uncomfortable conversations with her parents, Dean, a neurosurgeon, and Missy, a psychiatrist. Later, her brother Jeremy arrives and shares embarrassing stories about Rose at dinner. Chris also observes eerie behavior from the family's black servants, Georgina and Walter.

Missy tricks Chris into a hypnotherapy session, using the noise of a spoon stirring in a teacup as a hypnotic trigger, ostensibly to cure his smoking addiction. While in a trance, he reveals that his mother was killed in a [[Hit and run|hit-and-run]] when he was a child, and he feels guilty because he waited too long to call for help. At Missy's prompting, his consciousness falls into a dark void she calls the ""sunken place,"" where he becomes powerless. The next morning, he finds that his desire to smoke has vanished.

Dozens of wealthy white guests arrive for the Armitages' annual get-together, and Chris feels uncomfortable with their remarks about him. He meets a blind art dealer, Jim Hudson, who takes an interest in his photography, and Logan King, another black man whom Chris finds oddly familiar. Like Walter and Georgina, Logan behaves strangely and is married to a white woman thirty years his senior. When Chris tries to photograph Logan, the camera flash causes Logan to become hysterical, rushing at Chris and shouting frantically for him to ""get out.""

The party guests hold a [[silent auction]], where Hudson makes the winning bid, with Chris as the ""prize."" Chris sends a photo of Logan to his friend, [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] officer Rod Williams, who recognizes Logan as Andre Hayworth, a missing man from Brooklyn. Chris then discovers photos of Rose with numerous black partners, including Walter and Georgina, contradicting her claim that he is her first black boyfriend. As he tries to leave, Rose refuses to give him the car keys. Jeremy blocks the door, and Missy uses the hypnotic trigger to send Chris back to the sunken place.

Chris awakens strapped to an armchair in the basement. In a video, Hudson explains that the family transplants the brains of wealthy white people into others' bodies to acquire their desired physical characteristics, leaving the hosts' consciousnesses trapped in the sunken place. Hudson clarifies that he doesn't care about Chris's race—he only wants his eyesight. Meanwhile, Rod, who has been trying to contact Chris and suspects foul play, goes to the police, but they dismiss his concerns as paranoia about [[sex trafficking]].

Missy attempts to hypnotize Chris again, but he blocks the trigger by plugging his ears with cotton stuffing from the armchair. He bludgeons Jeremy, kills Dean and Missy, and finishes off Jeremy when he attacks again. Chris tries to escape in Jeremy's Porsche but accidentally hits Georgina, who is possessed by Rose's grandmother, Marianne. Compelled by guilt over his mother's death, he goes back to help her, but she attacks him, causing the car to crash and killing her.

Rose and Walter, who is possessed by Rose's grandfather, Roman, arrive to capture Chris. He uses his phone's flash to briefly free Walter from Roman's control. Walter then takes Rose's rifle, shoots her, and turns the gun on himself. Rod arrives in a TSA car and picks up Chris, leaving Rose bleeding on the road.<!-- DO NOT CHANGE based on whether you believe she dies or not.

728,What We Do in the Shadows,"==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words only. -->
A documentary crew follows four vampire housemates—Viago, Vladislav, Deacon, and Petyr—who share a flat in the [[Wellington]] suburb of [[Te Aro]]. All of the vampires possess [[supernatural]] powers, including [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitation]] and the ability to [[Shapeshifting|transform into animals]]. Viago is a 17th century [[dandy]] who originally traveled to New Zealand in the 1940s in search of Katherine, the love of his life; Vladislav is a 12th century former tyrant known as ""[[Vlad the Impaler|Vladislav the Poker]]"", who is haunted by memories of his nemesis ""the Beast""; and Deacon is a 19th century former [[peddler]] and the ""young rebel"" of the group who was turned into a vampire by Petyr—a reclusive, ancient vampire who behaves like a [[feral]] animal and resembles [[Count Orlok]].

Each night, Viago, Vladislav, and Deacon take the bus into town and prowl the streets of Wellington to feed. Deacon's human [[Familiar spirit|familiar]], Jackie, runs errands for the vampires and cleans up the gore left behind by their feeding. A married mother, Jackie hopes to attain immortality, but is frustrated that Deacon will not turn her into a vampire as promised. Deacon requests that Jackie bring [[virginity|virgins]] to the flat so that the vampires can feed on them. She lures a woman who insulted her in [[primary school]] and her ex-boyfriend Nick to the flat. Though neither are actually virgins, the woman is killed, and Nick is chased throughout the flat and manages to get outside, only to be caught by Petyr, who turns him into a vampire.

Two months later, the vampires accept Nick into their group and bond with his human friend Stu, a computer analyst who introduces them to modern technology. Viago uses the Internet to find Katherine, who is now a 96-year-old widow living in a rest home in Wellington, and also briefly reconnects with his old servant Philip.

Despite being able to get his new friends into popular bars and clubs, Nick struggles to adapt to life as a vampire. Nick is also held in contempt by Deacon, who resents Nick's newfound popularity and his careless revealing of his vampirism to strangers he meets. One of these strangers, a [[vampire hunter]], breaks into the flat basement during the day and kills Petyr by exposing him to sunlight.

The vampires are furious when they discover Nick has indirectly caused Petyr's death, and Deacon tries to kill Nick before being interrupted by a police welfare check, but Viago hypnotizes them into not noticing anything out of the ordinary. Once the police leave, Nick is banished from the flat by the remaining vampires, though Stu is permitted to come as he pleases.

Several months later, the vampires receive an invitation to the annual [[masquerade ball|Unholy Masquerade]], hosted for the local undead population of vampires, [[zombie]]s, and [[witchcraft|witches]]. Vladislav refuses to attend after learning that ""the Beast"" will be the guest of honor. When Viago and Deacon arrive at the ball, they find in attendance Nick, Stu and Jackie, the latter of whom has been turned into a vampire by Nick. ""The Beast"" is revealed to be Vladislav's ex-girlfriend Pauline, and when Stu and the camera crew are discovered to be living humans, the party guests threaten to kill and feed on them. Vladislav arrives and fights with Pauline's new boyfriend Julian. Stu impales Julian on a flagpole, and the vampires and camera crew escape the ball with him, only to encounter a rival pack of [[werewolves]] who transform under the full moon. Stu and one of the cameramen are mauled. Believing Stu to be dead, the vampires run away and grieve for him.

After an indeterminate amount of time, Nick returns to the flat with Stu, who reveals he has survived the attack and was transformed into a werewolf. With Stu's urging, the pack visits the vampires along with Stu, and Nick's banishment is rescinded as well. Though momentarily apprehensive, Deacon invites the werewolf pack inside. Viago also reconnects and rekindles his romance with Katherine, whom he turns into a vampire. Scenes during the credits reveal that Vladislav has gotten back together with Pauline, repeating his cycle of self-inflicted torture over his relationship with her; and Jackie's husband is now serving as her familiar. A [[post-credits scene]] shows Deacon attempting to hypnotize the audience to forget the events of the film.","Comedy, Horror","starring       = {{Plainlist|

731,Kingsman: The Secret Service,"==Plot==
In 1997, Lee Unwin, a probationary secret agent, sacrifices himself in the [[Middle East]] to save his superior [[Harry Hart (Kingsman)|Harry Hart]]. Blaming himself for Lee's death, Harry returns to London and gives Lee's son [[Eggsy|Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin]] a medal engraved with an emergency assistance number.

Seventeen years later, Eggsy is a rebellious [[chav]], having dropped out of training for the [[Royal Marines]] despite his cunning and athletic talent.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/kingsman-the-secret-service-review|title=Kingsman: The Secret Service Review |author=Richard Lawson|magazine=Vanity Fair|date=12 February 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://m.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/reviews/kingsman-the-secret-service-review-spy-spoof-has-a-licence-to-thrill-30948603.html|title=Kingsman – The Secret Service review: Spy spoof has a licence to thrill|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk}}</ref> Arrested for stealing a car that belongs to a friend of his abusive stepfather, Dean, Eggsy calls the emergency number, leading Harry to arrange his release and subdue Dean's gang.

Harry explains that he is a member of Kingsman, a [[private intelligence]] service founded by the British elite, who lost their heirs in the [[First World War]] and put their money toward protecting the world. The organisation is named for the tailor shop in [[Savile Row]] used as a front for their operations. Codenamed ""Galahad"", Harry nominates Eggsy to replace agent ""Lancelot"", who was killed by the assassin Gazelle while trying to rescue radical climate change scientist Prof. James Arnold from kidnappers. Kingsman's technical support operative ""Merlin"" discovers Arnold working as though nothing has happened.

Hart attempts to interrogate Arnold at [[Imperial College London]], but a microchip in Arnold's neck explodes, killing him and putting Harry in a coma. The detonation signal is traced to Gazelle's employer Richmond Valentine, a billionaire philanthropist who has offered everyone in the world [[SIM card]]s with free cellular and Internet access. Hart, after recovering from his coma, poses as another philanthropist to meet Valentine.

Eggsy befriends fellow Kingsman trainee Roxy, while the elite other boys make fun of him. He endures Merlin's tests until they are the only candidates left. However, Eggsy refuses his final test, seemingly shooting a puppy he was given to raise—and Roxy is named the new ""Lancelot"". Harry learns of Valentine's connection to a religious hate group and travels to their church in Kentucky, wearing glasses containing a video transceiver. As Eggsy watches Harry's footage, Valentine triggers the SIM cards inside the church with a signal that causes the parishioners and Harry to become murderously violent. Harry is the only survivor but is shot in the face outside the church by Valentine.

Eggsy returns to Kingsman headquarters and notices Chester King, codename ""Arthur"" and Kingsman's leader, has the same implantation scar on his neck as Arnold. King reveals Valentine's plan to transmit his violence-inducing signal worldwide, ""culling"" most of humanity to avert its extinction from [[global warming]]. Valentine has recruited various world leaders and wealthy elite to his cause, implanted with chips to protect them from the signal; those who refuse are held captive at his bunker, including Crown Princess Tilde of Sweden. King poisons Eggsy's drink, but Eggsy switches glasses while distracting him, letting King poison himself instead and extracts the chip from King's neck.

Eggsy, Merlin and Roxy locate Valentine's bunker, where many of his conspirators are gathered. Roxy pilots high-altitude balloons to break up Valentine's satellite network, but he secures a replacement. Merlin flies to the bunker, where Eggsy masquerades as King, but is discovered by failed Kingsman recruit Charlie Hesketh.

Cornered by Valentine's men, Merlin activates the implanted chips' failsafe, killing the guards and conspirators as heads explode around the world. Valentine activates the signal, triggering worldwide pandemonium. Eggsy kills Gazelle and impales Valentine with one of Gazelle's sharpened [[Flex-Foot Cheetah|prosthetic blades]], stopping the signal. Eggsy, now the new ""Galahad"", offers his mother and baby half-sister a new home and prepares to take on Dean and his gang, just as Harry once did.","Action, Adventure, Comedy","starring       = {{indented plainlist|

Two years after the [[Battle of New York (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Battle of New York]],{{efn|As depicted in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012)<ref name=""CapTWSSynopsis1"" />}} [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] works in Washington, D.C., for the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], while adjusting to contemporary society. During a mission alongside Agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[counter-terrorism]] [[S.T.R.I.K.E. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.T.R.I.K.E.]] team led by Agent [[Brock Rumlow (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Brock Rumlow]] to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel from pirates led by [[Georges Batroc (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Georges Batroc]], Rogers discovers Romanoff has another assignment: to extract data from the ship's computers.

Returning to the [[Triskelion (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Triskelion]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, Rogers confronts Director [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] and is briefed about Project Insight: three [[Helicarriers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Helicarriers]] linked to spy satellites, designed to eliminate threats preemptively. Unable to decrypt Romanoff's data, Fury becomes suspicious about Insight and asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official and Secretary of Internal Security [[Alexander Pierce (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Alexander Pierce]] to delay the project. On his way to rendezvous with [[Maria Hill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maria Hill]], Fury is ambushed by assailants led by an assassin called the Winter Soldier. Escaping to Rogers' apartment, Fury warns him that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised but is shot by the Winter Soldier before handing Rogers a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing the ship's data. Fury is pronounced dead during surgery, and Hill recovers the body.

Pierce summons Rogers to the Triskelion. When Rogers withholds Fury's information, Pierce brands him a fugitive. Hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., Rogers meets with Romanoff. Using the data, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a [[supercomputer]] containing the [[mind uploading|preserved consciousness]] of [[Arnim Zola (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Arnim Zola]]. Zola reveals that after being captured by Rogers during [[World War II]],{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011)}} he [[Operation Paperclip|was recruited]] to S.H.I.E.L.D., where he secretly reformed [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]] within its ranks, sowing global chaos using the Winter Soldier as their primary assassin. The pair narrowly escapes death when a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker, and they realize that Pierce is Hydra's leader within S.H.I.E.L.D. Rogers and Romanoff enlist the help of [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] employee and former [[United States Air Force Pararescue|USAF pararescueman]] [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]], whom Rogers befriended, and acquire a powered ""[[EXO-7 Falcon|Falcon]]"" [[Wingsuit flying|wingpack]] used by Wilson while he was in the Air Force.

They capture S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Jasper Sitwell (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jasper Sitwell]], a Hydra [[Mole (espionage)|mole]], forcing him to divulge that Zola developed a [[data mining]] algorithm that can identify individuals becoming future threats to Hydra. The Insight Helicarriers will sweep the globe using satellite guns to eliminate the threat. Sitwell is killed in an ambush by the Winter Soldier, whom Rogers recognizes as [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]], his longtime best friend previously thought dead; he had survived due to Zola's experimentation and has been repeatedly brainwashed and cryogenically frozen to perform Hydra's missions. Hill manages to extract the trio to a safehouse where Fury, who had faked his death, plans to sabotage the Helicarriers by replacing their controller chips.

After the [[World Security Council]] members arrive for the Helicarriers' launch, Rogers broadcasts Hydra's plot to everyone at the Triskelion. Romanoff, disguised as one of the Council members, disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database so Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Following a struggle, Fury fatally shoots Pierce. Rogers and Wilson raid two Helicarriers and replace the controller chips, but Barnes destroys Wilson's suit and fights Rogers on the third. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other.

Rogers refuses to fight Barnes in an attempt to reach his friend, but as the ship collides with the Triskelion, Rogers falls into the [[Potomac River]]. Barnes rescues the unconscious Rogers before disappearing into the woods. With S.H.I.E.L.D. in disarray, Romanoff appears before a Senate subcommittee to defend her and Rogers' actions. Fury, under the cover of his apparent death, heads to Europe to pursue Hydra's remaining cells. Rogers and Wilson decide to find Barnes, while Rumlow, who was a Hydra agent, is hospitalized following the Triskelion's destruction.

When Litwak's [[amusement arcade|Arcade]] closes, the [[video game]] characters leave their in-game roles and socialize via a [[power strip]] called Game Central Station. Wreck-It Ralph, the villain of [[platform game]] ''Fix-It Felix, Jr.'', is frustrated with his assigned role. After being excluded from his game's 30th-anniversary party, Ralph decides to win a medal, convinced that it will earn him respect. Upon learning that the [[first-person shooter]] ''Hero's Duty'' awards medals, Ralph sneaks into ''Hero's Duty'' and obtains a medal after getting past insectoid monsters known as Cy-Bugs.

Ralph accidentally launches himself in an [[escape pod|escape shuttle]] with a Cy-Bug inside and crash-lands in ''Sugar Rush'', a confectionery-themed [[kart racing game]]. With Ralph gone, his game is labeled ""out of order"", putting it at risk of being unplugged. Fix-It Felix, Jr. himself leaves the game to find Ralph, allying with Sergeant Calhoun, the heroine of ''Hero's Duty''. Calhoun tracks the Cy-Bug, as Cy-Bugs behave as a [[computer virus|virus]] once outside their game. Felix worries Ralph will meet the same fate as Turbo, the protagonist of the racing game ''TurboTime'', who grew envious of a new ''[[RoadBlasters]]'' cabinet's success and invaded it, resulting in both games being unplugged.

In ''Sugar Rush'', racer Vanellope von Schweetz steals Ralph's medal and uses it to buy her way into the nightly race that determines which characters will be [[player character|playable]] the next day. King Candy, the ruler of ''Sugar Rush''{{'s}} world, forbids her to race, as she is a [[glitch]]. Vanellope promises to get the medal back if Ralph helps her win; he helps her build a new kart and teaches her to drive inside [[Diet Coke|Diet Cola]] Mountain. Meanwhile, Calhoun and Felix arrive in ''Sugar Rush'', where they fall into ""[[Nesquik]]-[[quicksand|sand]]"", work together to escape, and begin to fall in love.

King Candy [[hacker culture|hacks]] into ''Sugar Rush''{{'s}} [[source code|code]] and retrieves the medal, giving it back to Ralph. He claims that if Vanellope becomes a playable character, her glitching will lead to ''Sugar Rush'' being labeled out of order and unplugged, and Vanellope, unable to leave the game due to being a glitch, will die. Ralph decides he cannot allow Vanellope to race and destroys her kart. Meanwhile, Calhoun abandons Felix when he unintentionally reminds her of her late fiancé, who was eaten by a Cy-Bug. Felix is imprisoned by King Candy's assistant, Sour Bill, while Calhoun discovers that the Cy-Bug has multiplied exponentially.

Upon returning to ''Fix-It Felix, Jr.'', which has been evacuated, Ralph notices an image of Vanellope on the ''Sugar Rush'' cabinet. He returns to ''Sugar Rush'' and interrogates Sour Bill, who reveals that King Candy damaged Vanellope's code. King Candy's edits to the code also have ensured no one but himself knows Vanellope's true role. However, if Vanellope completes a race, the game will reset itself, deleting all of King Candy's changes. Ralph frees Vanellope and Felix from prison. Felix fixes Vanellope's kart. Vanellope belatedly enters the race, but the Cy-Bugs emerge and start destroying the game. Calhoun, Felix, and Ralph help evacuate the characters.

Unaware of the Cy-Bugs, King Candy attempts to ram Vanellope off the track, causing them both to glitch. The glitching unmasks King Candy as Turbo, who secretly took over ''Sugar Rush'' after surviving the unplugging of ''TurboTime''. Vanellope flees as Turbo is devoured by a Cy-Bug, which fuses with him into an insectoid monster. As glitches cannot leave their games, Vanellope is unable to evacuate. Remembering from ''Hero's Duty'' that a beacon will draw and destroy the Cy-Bugs, Ralph battles Turbo who stalled him and collapses the [[Mentos]] roof of Diet Cola Mountain, creating a glowing [[Diet Coke and Mentos eruption|eruption]] that lures and destroys Turbo and the Cy-Bugs. Vanellope rescues Ralph and crosses the finish line. The game resets, revealing her as the true ruler of ''Sugar Rush'', though she keeps her glitching ability, considering it an advantage.

Ralph returns to his game, content with his role as a villain and finally respected by his fellow characters. Felix and Calhoun marry, and Ralph watches Vanellope become ''Sugar Rush''{{'s}} favorite character.","Animation, Adventure, Comedy","starring       = {{Unbulleted list|[[John C.

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->
<!-- Plot section is an outline of the film, NOT a blow-by-blow account of everything you can remember -->
In 2010, disillusioned screenwriter Gil Pender and his fiancée, Inez, vacation in Paris with Inez's wealthy parents. Gil, struggling to finish his debut novel about a man who works in a nostalgia shop, finds himself drawn to the artistic history of Paris, especially the [[Lost Generation]] of the 1920s, and has ambitions to move there, which Inez dismisses. By chance, they meet Inez's friend, Paul, and his wife, Carol. Paul speaks with great authority but questionable accuracy on French history, annoying Gil but impressing Inez.

Intoxicated after a night of wine tasting, Gil decides to walk back to their hotel, while Inez goes with Paul and Carol by taxi. At midnight, a 1920s [[Peugeot Type 176|car]] pulls up beside Gil and delivers him to a party for [[Jean Cocteau]], attended by other people of the 1920s Paris art scene. [[Zelda Fitzgerald]], bored, encourages her husband [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|Scott]] and Gil to leave with her. They head to a cafe where they run into [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Juan Belmonte]]. After Zelda and Scott leave, Gil and Hemingway discuss writing, and Hemingway offers to show Gil's novel to [[Gertrude Stein]]. As Gil leaves to fetch his manuscript, he returns to 2010; the cafe is now a laundromat.

The next night, Gil tries to repeat the experience with Inez, but she leaves before midnight. Returning to the 1920s, Gil accompanies Hemingway to visit Gertrude Stein, who critiques [[Pablo Picasso]]'s new painting of his lover Adriana. Gil becomes drawn to Adriana, a costume designer who also had affairs with [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Georges Braque]]. Adriana having heard the first line of Gil's novel, praises it, and admits she has always had a longing for the past.

Gil continues to time travel the following nights. Inez grows jaded with Paris and Gil's constant disappearing, while her father grows suspicious and hires a [[Private investigator|private detective]] to follow him. Adriana leaves Picasso and continues to bond with Gil, who is conflicted by his attraction to her. Gil explains his situation to [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Man Ray]], and [[Luis Buñuel]]; as [[Surrealism|surrealists]], they do not question his claim of coming from the future. Gil later suggests the plot of ""[[The Exterminating Angel]]"" to Buñuel.

While Inez and her parents travel to [[Mont Saint Michel]], Gil meets Gabrielle, an antique dealer and fellow admirer of the [[Lost Generation]]. He later finds Adriana's diary at a book stall, which reveals that she was in love with Gil and dreamed of being gifted earrings before making love to him. To seduce Adriana, Gil tries to steal a pair of Inez's earrings but is thwarted by her early return to the hotel room.

Gil buys new earrings and returns to the past. After he gives Adriana the earrings, a horse-drawn carriage arrives, transporting them to the [[Belle Époque]], an era Adriana considers Paris's [[Golden Age]]. They go to the [[Moulin Rouge]] where they meet [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Edgar Degas]], who all agree that Paris's best era was the [[Renaissance]]. Adriana is offered a job designing ballet costumes; thrilled, she proposes to Gil that they stay, but he, observing the unhappiness of Adriana and the other artists, realizes that chasing nostalgia is fruitless because the present is always ""a little unsatisfying."" Adriana decides to stay, and they part ways.

Gil rewrites the first two chapters of his novel and retrieves his draft from Stein, who praises his rewrite but says that on reading the new chapters, Hemingway did not believe that the protagonist does not realize that his fiancée, based on Inez, is having an affair with the character based on Paul. Gil returns to 2010 and confronts Inez, who admits to having slept with Paul but disregards it as a meaningless fling. Gil breaks up with her and decides to move to Paris. The detective following him takes a ""wrong turn"" and ends up being chased by the palace guards of [[Louis XVI]] just before [[French Revolution|a revolution]] breaks out. While walking by the [[Seine]] at midnight, Gil encounters Gabrielle. As it begins to rain, he offers to walk her home and learns that they share a love for Paris in the rain.","Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","starring       = {{plainlist|

Emmet devises a plan to infiltrate Business's headquarters and disarm the Kragle. The heist almost succeeds until Emmet and his friends are captured and imprisoned. Business decapitates Vitruvius and throws the Piece of Resistance into an abyss before arming a self-destruct device to execute all the captured Master Builders. Before he dies, Vitruvius reveals he made up the prophecy, but his spirit returns to tell Emmet that Emmet’s self-belief makes him the Special. Strapped to the self-destruct mechanism's battery, Emmet flings himself off the edge of the tower and into the abyss, disarming the mechanism and saving his friends and the Master Builders. Inspired by Emmet's sacrifice, Wyldstyle, who reveals her real name to be Lucy, rallies the Lego people across the universe to use whatever creativity they have to build machines and weapons to fight Business's forces.

The abyss transports Emmet to the human world, where the events of his life are being played out in a basement by a boy named [[List of The Lego Movie characters#Finn|Finn]] on his father's Lego set. Finn's father, revealed to be the Man Upstairs, chastises his son for creating hodgepodges of different playsets and begins to glue his perceived ""perfect"" creations together permanently. Realizing the danger, Emmet wills himself to move and gains Finn's attention. Finn returns Emmet and the Piece of Resistance to the set, where Emmet becomes a Master Builder and confronts Business. In the human world, Finn's father looks at his son's creations and realizes he is suppressing his son's creativity. Through a speech by Emmet, Finn calls his father very special and says he has the power to change everything. Finn's father reconciles with his son, which plays out as Business reforming, capping the Kragle with the Piece of Resistance, and ungluing his victims with mineral spirits. After the world is restored, Lucy and Emmet enter a relationship with Batman's blessing. Finn's father grants Finn and his [[List of The Lego Movie characters#Bianca|younger sister]] permission to play with the Lego sets as well, causing [[Duplo]] aliens to arrive in the Lego universe and threaten destruction.{{efn|As depicted in ''[[The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part]]'' (2019)}}","Animation, Action, Adventure","starring       = {{Plainlist|

<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->
In 2259, Captain [[James T. Kirk]] is removed from command of the starship [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] for violating the [[Prime Directive]] by revealing the ship to the primitive inhabitants of the planet Nibiru in order to save them, and Spock, from a cataclysmic volcanic eruption. Admiral [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Christopher Pike]] is reinstated as commanding officer with Kirk demoted to first officer. [[Spock]] is transferred to another ship. Shortly after, Starfleet officer Thomas Harewood, sent by Commander John Harrison, bombs a [[Section 31 (Star Trek)|Section 31]] installation in [[London]]. During an emergency meeting on the situation, Harrison uses a ship to ambush and kill Pike and other senior officers, before transporting to [[Klingon#Homeworld|Kronos]], homeworld of the hostile [[Klingon]]s.

Admiral Alexander Marcus reinstates Kirk and Spock to the ''Enterprise'' with orders to kill Harrison using a new long-range stealth torpedo. Chief Engineer [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Montgomery Scott]] objects to allowing untested torpedoes on board without knowing their specifications; when he is overruled, he resigns. Kirk assigns [[Pavel Chekov]] to replace Scotty. En route to Kronos, ''Enterprise''{{'}}s warp capabilities become disabled. Kirk leads a team with Spock and [[Uhura]] to the planet, where they are ambushed by Klingon patrols. Harrison appears and kills the Klingons. Harrison surrenders when he learns the precise number of torpedoes on board ''Enterprise''.

Dr. [[Leonard McCoy]] and Marcus's daughter, Dr. [[Carol Marcus (Star Trek)|Carol Marcus]], open a torpedo at Harrison's urging, revealing the torpedoes contain [[cryonics|cryonically frozen]] humans. Harrison is taken to ''Enterprise''{{'}}s brig, where he reveals his true identity as [[Khan Noonien Singh]], a genetically engineered superhuman, awoken by Admiral Marcus from centuries of sleep and forced to develop advanced weapons. Khan reveals that Marcus sabotaged ''Enterprise''{{'}}s warp drive, intending for the Klingons to destroy the ship after it fired on Kronos, sparking a war with the Klingon Empire. Khan also gives Kirk a set of coordinates, which Kirk asks Scott to investigate. Scott discovers the coordinates lead to a covert Starfleet facility.

''Enterprise'' is intercepted by a much larger Starfleet warship, USS ''Vengeance'', commanded by Admiral Marcus. Marcus demands that Kirk deliver Khan, but ''Enterprise'' flees to Earth to expose him. After ''Vengeance'' disables ''Enterprise'' near the Moon, Carol reveals her presence aboard ''Enterprise'' to stop the attack. Marcus forcibly transports Carol to ''Vengeance'' before ordering ''Enterprise''{{'}}s destruction. ''Vengeance'' loses power after being sabotaged by Scott, who infiltrated the ship. With transporters down, Kirk and Khan, with the latter's knowledge of the warship's design, [[space diving|space-jump]] to ''Vengeance''. Meanwhile, Spock contacts his future self on New Vulcan, who tells him of [[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan|his own encounter with Khan]] and warns that he cannot be trusted. After fighting their way to the bridge, Khan overpowers Kirk, Scott, and Carol, kills Marcus, and takes control of ''Vengeance''.

Khan demands that Spock return his frozen crew in exchange for the ''Enterprise'' officers. Spock complies, having had McCoy surreptitiously remove Khan's frozen crew from the torpedoes beforehand. When Khan starts shooting at ''Enterprise'', Spock detonates the warheads, crippling the ship. With both starships caught in Earth's gravity, they plummet toward the surface. Kirk enters ''Enterprise''{{'}}s radioactive reactor chamber to realign the warp core, sacrificing himself to save the ship.

Khan crashes ''Vengeance'' into [[San Francisco]] in an attempt to destroy Starfleet headquarters, while McCoy discovers that Khan's blood has regenerative properties that may save Kirk. A vengeful Spock pursues Khan through the city and the two engage in hand-to-hand combat. As Spock prepares to kill Khan, Uhura beams down and stops him, revealing that he is their only chance to save Kirk. Khan's blood revives Kirk and Khan is sealed in his cryogenic pod and stored with his compatriots. One year later, Kirk speaks at ''Enterprise''{{'}}s re-dedication ceremony. The ''Enterprise'' crew embarks on a five-year exploratory mission.","Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","starring       = {{Plainlist|

<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT before adding material. The word count for a plot is usually 400-700 words. -->
On October 28, 2003, 19-year-old [[Harvard University]] sophomore [[Mark Zuckerberg]] is dumped by his girlfriend, Erica Albright. Returning to his dorm, Zuckerberg writes an insulting post about Albright on his [[LiveJournal]] blog. He creates a campus website called [[Facemash]] by hacking and downloading photos of female students from house [[face book]]s, then allowing site visitors to rate their attractiveness. After traffic to the site crashes parts of Harvard's computer network, Zuckerberg is given six months of [[disciplinary probation|academic probation]].

Facemash’s popularity attracts the attention of twins [[Cameron Winklevoss|Cameron]] and [[Tyler Winklevoss]] and their business partner [[Divya Narendra]]. The trio invites Zuckerberg to work on [[Harvard Connection]], a social network exclusive to Harvard students and aimed at dating. Zuckerberg approaches his friend [[Eduardo Saverin]] with an idea for <!--ORIGINAL NAME OF THE COMPANY-->Thefacebook<!--ORIGINAL NAME OF THE COMPANY-->, a [[Social networking service|social networking]] website that would be exclusive to [[Ivy League]] students. Saverin provides $1,000 in seed funding, allowing Zuckerberg to build the website, which quickly becomes popular. When they learn of Thefacebook, the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed, believing that Zuckerberg stole their idea while misleading them by stalling development on the Harvard Connection website. They raise their complaint with Harvard President [[Larry Summers]], who is dismissive and sees no value in disciplinary action on Thefacebook or Zuckerberg.

Saverin and Zuckerberg meet fellow student Christy Lee, who asks them to ""Facebook me,"" which impresses them. As Thefacebook grows in popularity, Zuckerberg expands the network to [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], and [[Stanford University|Stanford]]. Lee arranges for Saverin and Zuckerberg to meet [[Napster]] co-founder [[Sean Parker]], who presents a ""billion-dollar"" vision for the company. Zuckerberg is impressed, but Saverin dismisses him as paranoid and delusional. Parker also suggests dropping ""the"" in Thefacebook and simply renaming the site to Facebook''.''

Later, Zuckerberg relocates the company to [[Palo Alto]], based on Parker's advice; Saverin remains in New York to work on business development. Parker later moves into the house that Zuckerberg is using as a base of operations and becomes more involved with the company, much to Saverin's annoyance.

After narrowly losing in the 2004 [[Henley Royal Regatta]] for Harvard against the [[Hollandia Roeiclub]], the Winklevoss twins discover that Facebook has expanded to Europe with [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[London School of Economics|LSE]], and decide to sue the company for [[Intellectual property rights|intellectual property theft]]. Meanwhile, Saverin objects to Parker making business decisions for Facebook and freezes the company's bank account in the resulting dispute. He relents when Zuckerberg reveals that they have secured $500,000 from [[angel investor]] [[Peter Thiel]].

After traveling to the company's new headquarters on the pretense of attending a business meeting and ""millionth user party,"" Saverin becomes enraged when he discovers that the new investment deal allows his share of Facebook to be [[Stock dilution|diluted]] from 34% to 0.03%, without diluting the ownership percentage of any other owner. He confronts Zuckerberg and Parker, and Saverin vows to sue Zuckerberg. Saverin's name had already been removed from the masthead as co-founder and CFO; Parker tells him that he is no longer a part of Facebook and has security eject him from the building.

Later, Parker is apprehended for cocaine possession with a minor at a party celebrating one million users. He attempts to blame Saverin, so Zuckerberg cuts ties with him, telling him to go home.

In separate [[Deposition (law)|depositions]], the Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's callous attitude will make him unsympathetic to a jury. Alone, Zuckerberg sends a Facebook friend request to Albright and repeatedly refreshes the page.","Biography, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words only. -->
Two days before his wedding, [[bachelor party|bachelor]] Doug Billings travels to [[Las Vegas]] with his best friends Phil Wenneck, a sarcastic secondary school teacher, Stu Price, an apprehensive dentist, and Alan Garner, his odd future brother-in-law. Sid, the father of Doug's fiancée Tracy, loans Doug his vintage [[Mercedes-Benz W111]] to drive to Vegas. They book a suite at [[Caesars Palace]] and celebrate by sneaking onto the hotel rooftop and taking shots of [[Jägermeister]].

The next day, Phil, Stu and Alan awaken, unable to remember the previous night. Doug is nowhere to be found, Stu's tooth is missing, the suite is a mess, a [[Bengal tiger]] is in the bathroom, and a baby is in the closet. They see Doug's mattress impaled on a statue outside, and when they ask for their Mercedes, the valet delivers a [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department|Las Vegas police]] cruiser.

Retracing their steps, the trio travel to a hospital, discovering they were drugged with [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]], causing their memory loss, and that they went there from a chapel the previous night. At the chapel, they learn that Stu married a [[call girl]] named Jade, despite his relationship with his shrewish girlfriend Melissa. Outside the chapel, the trio is attacked by a gang of men demanding to know where ""he"" is. Bewildered, they flee and track down Jade, who is revealed to be the baby's mother.

They are arrested by the police for having stolen the cruiser. To get the Mercedes out of impound and get released, the trio unwittingly volunteer to be targets for a [[taser]] demonstration. While driving the car, they discover a naked Chinese man named Leslie Chow in the trunk, who attacks the trio and flees. Alan confesses that he drugged their drinks to ensure they had a good night, believing the drug to be [[MDMA|Ecstasy]].

Returning to their suite, they find [[Mike Tyson]], who knocks Alan unconscious and orders them to return his tiger to his mansion. After Stu drugs it, they load it into the Mercedes, and drive to Tyson's mansion. However, the tiger awakens and attacks them, scratching Phil on the neck and damaging the car's interior. They push the car the rest of the way to the mansion and deliver the tiger to Tyson, who shows them security camera footage indicating they did not lose Doug until after they got back to the hotel.

While driving back, their car is rammed by a black [[Cadillac Escalade]] manned by Chow and his gang from the chapel. Chow accuses them of kidnapping him and stealing $80,000 in [[poker chip]]s. As they deny it, he tells them he has Doug, and threatens to kill him if the chips are not returned. Unable to find Chow's chips, Alan, with help from Stu and Jade, uses his knowledge of [[card counting]] to win $82,400 playing [[blackjack]].

They meet Chow in the [[Mojave Desert]] to exchange the chips for Doug, only to find that the ""Doug"" in question is actually the drug dealer who accidentally sold the [[Flunitrazepam|roofies]] to Alan. With the real Doug's wedding set to occur in five hours, Phil calls Tracy to tell her they cannot find him. Simultaneously, the other Doug's remarks that someone who takes roofies is more likely to end up on the floor than on the roof, causes Stu to realize where Doug is.

They return to Caesars Palace where they find a dazed and badly sunburned Doug on the roof. They moved him there on his mattress as a practical joke, but forgot when the roofies wore off; Doug threw the mattress onto the statue in an attempt to signal for help. Before leaving, Stu makes arrangements to meet Jade for a date the following week.

With no flights available, the four drive home in the mangled Mercedes, where Doug reveals that he has Chow's original $80,000 in his pocket. Despite their late arrival, Doug and Tracy are married. At the reception, Stu gleefully breaks up with Melissa. Alan finds Stu's digital camera containing photos of the debauchery from the night in Las Vegas, and the four agree to look at the pictures before deleting them.",Comedy,"starring       = {{Plainlist|

In [[Istanbul]], [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agents [[James Bond (reboot series character)|James Bond]] and <!--Do not change to Eve. She is unnamed for most of the film.-->[[Miss Moneypenny|Eve Moneypenny]]<!--See talk page archives.--> pursue mercenary Patrice, who has stolen a hard drive containing details of undercover [[NATO]] agents. As Bond and Patrice fight atop a moving train, [[M (James Bond)|M]] orders Moneypenny to shoot Patrice, despite not having a clear shot; Moneypenny inadvertently hits Bond, who falls into a river. Bond is presumed dead and Patrice escapes with the hard drive.

Three months later, due to a [[public inquiry]] into M's handling of the stolen hard drive, she is pressured to retire by Gareth Mallory, the chairman of the [[Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament]] and a former [[Special Air Service|SAS]] officer. Although she says she is still useful, MI6's servers are hacked, and M receives a taunting computer message moments before the [[SIS Building|MI6 building]] explodes. Bond, who used his presumed death to retire, learns of the attack and returns to service in London. He fails a series of physical, medical, and psychological examinations, but M approves his return to the field, ordering him to identify Patrice's employer, recover the hard drive, and kill Patrice. He meets [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], MI6's new [[quartermaster]], who gives him a [[radio beacon]] and a [[Walther PPK]] pistol.

In [[Shanghai]], Bond follows Patrice and witnesses him killing a target. The two fight and Patrice dies before Bond can learn his employer's identity. Moneypenny joins Bond in his investigation, on Mallory's orders. Bond finds a [[casino token]] Patrice intended to cash in for the assassination, leading him to a casino in [[Macau]]. There, Bond is approached by [[Sévérine]], Patrice's accomplice. Recognising her tattoo, he concludes she was a sex slave ""rescued"" by a criminal who now employs her, a man Bond wishes to meet. She warns him he is targeted by her bodyguards, but promises to help if Bond kills her employer. Bond thwarts the attack and joins Sévérine on her yacht, the ''Chimera''. They travel to an abandoned island off the coast of Macau, where the crew captures and delivers them to Sévérine's employer, [[Raoul Silva]]. Silva, a former MI6 agent, turned to [[cyberterrorism]] and orchestrated the attack on MI6. Silva kills Sévérine. Bond uses Q's radio beacon to alert MI6 reinforcements, who capture Silva for [[Rendition (law)|rendition]] to Britain.

At MI6's new underground headquarters, Q attempts to decrypt Silva's laptop, but inadvertently gives it access to the MI6 servers, allowing Silva to escape. Bond and Q conclude that Silva wanted to be captured as part of a plan to kill M, whom he hates for [[Burn notice (document)|disavowing]] and betraying him to the [[Chinese government]] during the [[handover of Hong Kong]] in 1997, leaving him to be tortured and disfigured by a suicide attempt by cyanide pill. Silva escapes his cell and Bond chases him through the [[London Underground]] and thwarts Silva's attack at a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] inquiry where M is present.

Instructing Q and [[Bill Tanner]] to leave an electronic trail for Silva to follow, Bond uses his [[Aston Martin DB5]] to take M to Skyfall, his childhood home in the [[Scottish Highlands]]. They meet Skyfall's [[gamekeeper]] Kincade, and  the trio rigs the house with [[booby trap]]s. When Silva's men arrive, Bond, M, and Kincade kill most of them, but M is wounded. Silva arrives by helicopter with more men and heavy weapons, so Bond sends M and Kincade through a [[priest hole]] to hide in a nearby chapel, and rigs propane tanks to explode. As the house and the helicopter are destroyed, Bond escapes down the same tunnel.

Silva survives the destruction of the house, following Kincade and M to the chapel. Confronting M, Silva forces his gun into her hand and presses his [[Temple (anatomy)|temple]] to hers, begging her to kill them both. Bond arrives and kills Silva by throwing a knife into his back. M then succumbs to her wounds and dies in Bond's arms.

Following M's funeral, Moneypenny formally introduces herself to Bond and tells him she is retiring from fieldwork to become secretary for Mallory, the newly appointed M. Bond meets Mallory, and tells him he is ready to get back to work.","Action, Adventure, Thriller","starring = {{Plainlist|

After eight months' treatment in a mental health facility for [[bipolar disorder]], Patrizio ""Pat"" Solitano Jr. is released into the care of his parents, Patrizio Sr. and Dolores, at his childhood home in [[Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania]]. His primary focus is to reconcile with his ex-wife, Nikki. She has moved away and obtained a restraining order against him after Pat found her in the shower with another man and badly beat him.

Pat's [[therapist]], Cliff Patel, tries to convince him to keep taking his [[Psychiatric medication|medication]] because a repeat of his violent outbursts might send him back to the clinic. Pat tells him that he has a new outlook on life: He attempts to see the good, or [[silver lining (idiom)|silver lining]]s, in all that he experiences.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/films/reviews/view/24456|title=Silver Linings Playbook - Film Reviews - Films - Spirituality & Practice|website=www.spiritualityandpractice.com|access-date=November 13, 2018|archive-date=November 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113170027/https://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/films/reviews/view/24456|url-status=live}}</ref> Meanwhile, Pat experiences a series of [[Panic attack|anxiety attacks]].

Pat attends dinner at his best friend Ronnie's house, where Ronnie's sister-in-law, Tiffany Maxwell, a widow with an unnamed disorder, is also a guest. They connect, talking about different psychiatric medications they have taken to manage their [[Mental disorder|mental illnesses]]. She tries to offer him [[casual sex]], but Pat is focused on getting Nikki back. Trying to get closer to him, Tiffany offers to deliver a letter to Nikki if, in return, he partners with her in an upcoming dance competition. Convinced that helping Tiffany will show Nikki he has changed and has developed sensitivity to others, Pat agrees. Pat and Tiffany start practicing over the following weeks.

Hoping to open a restaurant, Patrizio Sr. has resorted to [[Bookmaker#Legality|illegal bookmaking]]. Having bet most of his money on a [[Philadelphia Eagles]] game, Patrizio asks Pat to attend for good luck, irrationally believing Pat's attention to the game affects its outcome. Pat points out this is [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]] ideation but appeases his father. Pat asks Tiffany for time off from practice to attend the game. She gives him a typed reply from Nikki, which cautiously hints they may be able to reconcile. Before entering the stadium, Pat and his brother Jake get into a fight with racist fans and are arrested. The Eagles lose the game, and Patrizio is furious.

When Patrizio claims that the Eagles lost because of Tiffany's newfound involvement in Pat's life, she refutes his allegations by pointing out that Philadelphia sports teams had done better whenever she and Pat were together. Convinced, Patrizio makes a [[parlay (gambling)|parlay]] with his friend Randy: If the Eagles win their week 16 game against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and Tiffany and Pat score five out of ten in their dance competition, he will win back double the money he lost on the first bet.

Pat is reluctant, but Tiffany, Dolores, and Patrizio conspire to persuade him to dance in the competition, telling him Nikki will be there. Noticing that the letter from Nikki includes the phrase ""If it's me reading the signs..."", frequently used by Tiffany, he realizes that Tiffany fabricated the letter. Tiffany, Pat, and their friends and family arrive at the competition on the night of the football game. Tiffany despairs when she sees Nikki in the audience, invited by Ronnie and his wife Veronica. They want Nikki to lift her restraining order on Pat, giving them the chance to reconcile. Tiffany starts to drink heavily at the bar.

Pat finds Tiffany moments before their turn and drags her onto the dance floor. They begin their routine as the Eagles defeat the Cowboys. After their set, Tiffany and Pat receive an average score of exactly 5.0 points amid cheers from friends and family and confused looks from the crowd. Pat approaches Nikki and whispers into her ear. Seeing this, Tiffany runs off. Pat Sr. tells his son that unlike Nikki, Tiffany really loves him, and he should not let her go, as it would haunt him for the rest of his life. Pat catches Tiffany and hands her a letter in which he admits to knowing she forged the letter earlier. He confesses that he loved her from the moment they became acquainted, but that it took him a long time to realize and accept it. They share a kiss.

764,This Is England,"==Plot==
In July 1983, Shaun is a troubled 12-year-old boy who lives with his widowed mother in an unspecified area in the [[East Midlands]]. Shaun is alienated, frequently antagonised at school and around town. On the last day of the school year, Shaun gets into a fight at school with a boy named Harvey after Harvey insults him for wearing wide [[bell-bottoms]] and making an offensive joke about his father, who was killed in the [[Falklands War]]. On his way home, Shaun comes across a gang of young [[skinhead]]s led by Richard ""Woody"" Woodford, who feels sympathy for Shaun and invites him to join the group. He introduces Shaun to Milky, the only black skinhead of the gang; Pukey; Kes; and the overweight, dim-witted Gadget. Despite some initial hostilities between Shaun and Gadget, the gang accepts Shaun as a member. Shaun bonds closely with Woody, viewing him a big brother figure, and his girlfriend Lorraine ""Lol"" Jenkins, who takes a motherly role towards him. Shaun also develops a romantic relationship with Michelle, also known as Smell, an older girl who dresses in a [[New wave music|new wave]], [[New Romantic]] style.

During a party one night, the group is ambushed by a bald, tattooed, moustachioed, machete-wielding man, who is then attacked by Andrew ""Combo"" Gascoigne, a first-wave skinhead. With the attack revealed to be a prank, Woody announces that Combo had just finished a three-year prison sentence, and Combo introduces the man as his associate Banjo. Combo, a charismatic but unstable man with [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] tendencies, begins to express [[English nationalism|English nationalist]] and [[Racism|racist]] views, alienating Woody, Lol, Kes, and offending Milky. Later on, he attempts to enforce his leadership over the other skinheads. When Combo mentions the Falklands War as part of a speech, an upset Shaun reveals to the gang that his father died in that conflict, which Combo then uses to manipulate the boy into joining his side. Consequently, the gang splits, with young Shaun, the belligerent Pukey, and Gadget, who feels bullied by Woody for his weight, choosing Combo over Woody's apolitical gang.

Shaun finds a father figure in Combo, who in turn is impressed by, and identifies with, Shaun. Combo's group attend a [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] meeting. On the drive home, Pukey expresses doubt over their racist and nationalist politics. Enraged, Combo stops the car and throws Pukey out, assaulting him and calling him homophobic slurs, abandoning him in isolated countryside by the roadside.

The gang deface walls, intimidate local children and [[Hate crime|spray racist slogans]] on Asian shopkeeper Mr Sandhu's walls, while Shaun, previously banned from the shop, launches a bigoted verbal assault on Sandhu with demands for alcohol and cigarettes. Combo viciously threatens Sandhu with a [[machete]] and the gang steal goods for a birthday party under Combo's instructions.

Combo becomes upset after Lol, Woody's girlfriend, rejects him when he admits that he has loved her since they had sex years before. To console himself, Combo buys [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] from Milky, and invites him to a party. While intoxicated, Combo and Milky bond, but Combo becomes increasingly bitter and envious, all wrapped up in a racist viewpoint, when Milky shares details of his many relatives, comfortable family life and happy upbringing, everything that Combo lacked. An enraged Combo enters a frenzied state and brutally beats Milky unconscious, while Banjo holds down Shaun, and Meggy watches on in horror. An angry Combo violently throws Shaun out of his flat after Shaun verbally defends Milky, then slams the door hard. When Banjo expresses his desire to hit Milky as well, Combo violently beats him and evicts him and Meggy from the flat. Horrified at the realisation of what he has done, a remorseful Combo weeps over Milky. Shaun and Combo later take Milky to a nearby hospital.

Some time later, Shaun is in his bedroom looking at a picture of his late father. He is contemplating the incident and brooding about what happened, with his mother Cynthia assuring him that Milky will be all right. Shaun is then shown walking near the beach and throwing his [[Flag of England|St George's Flag]], a gift from Combo, into the sea.","Crime, Drama","starring       = [[Thomas Turgoose]]<br />[[Stephen Graham]]<br />[[Andrew Shim]]<br />[[Vicky McClure]]<br />[[Joe Gilgun]]<br />[[Rosamund Hanson]]

To set an example to make sure nobody else will try to bet on a fixed race, the Mob killed Max, his wife, and his son Henry.

Lindsey suggests that Nick might be missing, and after she leaves, Slevin is kidnapped by two henchmen, who take him to ""The Boss"". Mistaking Slevin for Nick, The Boss orders him to repay a gambling debt or kill the son of his rival, ""The Rabbi""; Believing The Rabbi is responsible for assassinating his son (seen in the intro), The Boss wants The Rabbi's homosexual son, Yitzchok ""The Fairy"", to be killed in revenge. Slevin returns to the apartment but is kidnapped again, this time by two of The Rabbi's Jewish henchmen. The Rabbi also mistakes Slevin for Nick and also demands he repay a gambling debt. Slevin tells The Boss he will kill Yitzchok. Meanwhile, it becomes apparent that Goodkat is involved with both sides, that he is responsible for Nick's debts being called in, and that he plans to kill Slevin after Yitzchok dies and make it look like they both committed suicide.

Slevin is approached by Detective Brikowski, who is investigating The Boss and The Rabbi. Brikowski has also been informed that Goodkat is back in town for the first time in twenty years and thinks there is a connection between The Boss, The Rabbi, Goodkat, and Slevin. After pretending to be gay, Slevin gets invited to Yitzchok's apartment, where he and Goodkat kill Yitzchok and his bodyguards. The two then kidnap The Boss and The Rabbi, whom they restrain in The Boss's penthouse. There, Slevin reveals he is Henry, Max's son. The mobsters who killed Max were The Boss and The Rabbi. Goodkat was the assassin hired to kill young Henry. After an attack of conscience, Goodkat raised Henry as his own. Slevin suffocates The Rabbi and The Boss by taping plastic bags over their heads, killing them the same way they killed his father. Since Lindsey photographed Goodkat while investigating Nick's disappearance, Goodkat shoots her to protect his identity.

While hunting for Slevin, Brikowski gets a phone call from his boss and learns the meaning of the pseudonym Slevin Kelevra: ""Lucky Number Slevin"" was the horse Max had bet on, and ""Kelevra"" is Hebrew for bad dog, mirroring Goodkat's name. Brikowski murdered Slevin's mother to pay his own gambling debts twenty years ago. As he hears this story, Brikowski resigns himself to his fate as Slevin appears in his back seat and shoots him.

Later, at the bus terminal, Slevin is met by Lindsey. Goodkat previously informed Slevin that he had to murder Lindsey. However, Slevin explained his true identity to Lindsey and helped fake her death. When Goodkat appears, aware of the deception, Slevin explains he had to save her and did not think Goodkat would understand. Having saved Slevin as a boy, Goodkat states that he understands and agrees to leave Lindsey alone. Goodkat returns Slevin's father's old watch and disappears into the crowd.","Action, Crime, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|

770,Joyeux Noël,"==Plot==

The story centres mainly upon six characters: Gordon (a Lieutenant of the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]]); Audebert (a French Lieutenant in the 26th Infantry and reluctant son of a general); Horstmayer (a [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish]] German Lieutenant of the [[8th Division (German Empire)|93rd Infantry]]); Father Palmer (a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] priest working as a [[chaplain]] and [[stretcher-bearer]]); and two famous [[opera]] stars, German [[tenor]] Nikolaus Sprink (based on [[Walter Kirchhoff]]){{citation needed|date=February 2024}} and his [[Danish people|Danish]] fiancée, [[mezzo-soprano]] Anna Sørensen.

The film begins with scenes of schoolboys reciting patriotic speeches that both praise their countries and condemn their enemies. In Scotland, two young brothers, Jonathan and William, join up to fight, followed by their [[Priest (Catholic Church)|priest]], Father Palmer, who becomes a [[chaplain]]. In Germany, Sprink is interrupted during a performance by a German officer announcing a [[Military reserve force|reserve]] call up. French soldier Audebert looks at a photograph of his pregnant wife, whom he has had to leave behind (in the [[German occupation of north-east France during World War I|occupied part]] of France, just in front of his trench), and prepares to exit into the trenches for an Allied assault on German lines. However, the assault fails, with the French and British taking many casualties while William loses his life.

In Germany, Anna gets permission to perform for [[Wilhelm, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince Wilhelm]], and Sprink is allowed to accompany her. They spend a night together and then perform. Afterward, Sprink expresses bitterness at the comfort of the generals at their headquarters and resolves to go back to the front to sing for the troops. Sprink initially opposes Anna's decision to go with him, but he agrees shortly afterward.

The unofficial truce begins when the British begin to sing festive songs and songs from home, accompanied by [[bagpipes]]. Sprink and Sørensen arrive on the German front line, and Sprink sings for his comrades. As Sprink sings ""[[Silent Night]]"", he is accompanied by Father Palmer's bagpipes from the Scottish front line. Sprink responds to Palmer and exits his trench with a small Christmas tree, singing ""[[Adeste Fideles]]"". Following Sprink's lead, Audebert, Horstmayer, and Gordon meet in [[no-man's-land]] and agree on a [[cease-fire]] for the evening.

The various soldiers meet and wish each other ""Joyeux Noël"", ""Frohe Weihnachten"", and ""Merry Christmas"". They exchange chocolate, champagne, and photographs of loved ones. Horstmayer gives Audebert back his wallet containing a photograph of his wife, which was lost in the attack a few days prior, and they connect over pre-war memories. Father Palmer celebrates a brief [[Eucharist|Mass]] for the soldiers (in [[Latin]] as was the practice in the [[Catholic Church]] at that time), and the soldiers retire deeply moved. However, Jonathan remains totally unmoved by the events around him, choosing to grieve for his brother. The following morning, the Lieutenants agree to extend the truce to allow each side to bury their dead, followed by cordial fraternisation for the rest of the day. As their soldiers play football, Audebert and Horstmayer sympathise, speaking in French of their memories of [[Paris]] and [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]], and their families. Horstmayer offers to take a letter to Lens for Audebert's wife. The next day, as the German forces shell the Allied position, Horstmayer offers to shelter the French and British soldiers in his trench, an offer Audebert and Gordon return to protect the Germans from their own retaliatory bombing. Before parting, aware that the truce has now truly ended, Audebert and Horstmayer lament that they cannot be friends, and hope that they both survive the war. As Audebert compliments Horstmayer on his French, the German reveals that his wife is French.

Prior to the bombing, Horstmayer learns that Anna and Sprink left without the German superior's assent to entertain fellow front soldiers and informs both that Sprink is going to be arrested for disobedience. As the Germans regain their trenches, Anna and Sprink remain behind and ask Audebert to take them as captives, in order to avoid separation. Letters that they hand over to him from the German soldiers (who had been hoping Anna would deliver them when she returned to [[Berlin]]), as well as letters from soldiers all across the front, are intercepted by military authorities, revealing that the truce had occurred.

Father Palmer is being sent back to his own parish and his battalion is disbanded as a mark of shame. Despite emphasising the humanity and goodwill of the truce, he is rebuked by the [[Bishop (Catholicism)|bishop]], who then preaches an [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] sermon to new recruits, in which he describes the Germans as inhumane and commands the recruits to kill every one of them. Father Palmer overhears the sermon and removes his cross as he leaves.

Back in the trenches, the British are ordered by a furious major (who is angered by the truce) to shoot a German soldier who is entering no-man's-land and crossing towards French lines. All of the soldiers deliberately miss in response, except the bitter Jonathan, who shoots the targeted German soldier. Audebert, hearing the familiar alarm clock ringing outside, rushes out and discovers that the soldier is a disguised Ponchel, his [[Batman (military)|batman]]. With his dying words, Ponchel reveals he gained help from the German soldiers, visited his mother, and had coffee with her. He also informs Audebert that he has a young son named Henri.

Audebert is punished by being sent to [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and he receives a dressing down from his father, a general. In a culminating rant, young Audebert upbraids his father, expressing no remorse at the [[Fraternization|fraternisation]] at the front, and his disgust for civilians and superiors who talk of sacrifice but know nothing of the struggle in the trenches. He also informs the general about his new grandson Henri. Moved by this revelation, the general then recommends they ""both try and survive this war for him"".

Horstmayer and his troops, who are confined in a train, are informed by the German Crown Prince that they are to be shipped to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], without permission to see their families as they pass through Germany. He then stomps on Jörg's harmonica and says that Horstmayer does not deserve his [[Iron Cross]]. As the train departs, the Germans start humming a British [[Christmas carol|carol]] they learnt from the British. (The carol in question, ""''L'Hymne des Fraternisés''"" / ""I'm Dreaming of Home"", is in fact a modern composition by [[Lori Barth]] and [[Philippe Rombi]].)","Drama, History, Music","starring       = [[Benno Fürmann]]<br />[[Guillaume Canet]]<br />[[Daniel Brühl]]<br />[[Diane Kruger]]<br />[[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]]<br />[[Alex Ferns]]

774,Brokeback Mountain,"==Plot==
 <!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 to 700 words. -->
In [[Wyoming]] in 1963, cowboys [[Ennis Del Mar]] and [[Jack Twist]] are hired by Joe Aguirre to herd his sheep through the summer on grazing pastures on Brokeback Mountain. After a night of heavy drinking, Jack makes a pass at Ennis. While initially reluctant, Ennis becomes receptive, and he and Jack have sex in their tent. Despite Ennis telling Jack that it was a one-time incident, they develop a sexual and emotional relationship. Near the end of their work contract, Ennis and Jack have a brawl that leaves both of them bloodied. Before parting ways, Ennis offhandedly laments that he left one of his shirts on the mountain.

Ennis marries his longtime fiancée Alma Beers and they have two daughters: Alma Jr. and Jenny. Jack returns the next summer seeking work, but Aguirre, who observed Jack and Ennis engaging in homosexual activity on the mountain, refuses to hire him. Jack moves to [[Texas]], where he met [[rodeo]] rider Lureen Newsome, the daughter of a wealthy businessman; they marry and have a son.

After four years apart, Jack visits Ennis. Upon meeting, they kiss passionately, which a stunned Alma inadvertently witnesses. At a motel room, Jack wants them to create a life together, but Ennis refuses to abandon his family and is haunted by a childhood memory of his father showing him a man's body who was tortured and killed for suspected homosexuality.

Ennis and Jack meet infrequently for private fishing trips while their respective marriages deteriorate. Lureen abandons the rodeo and goes into business with her father, with Jack working in sales. Alma and Ennis divorce in 1975. Upon hearing about it, Jack drives to Wyoming and tells Ennis that they should live together, but Ennis refuses to move away from his children.

Alma takes custody of Alma Jr. and Jenny, and marries Monroe, manager of the grocery store where she works. Ennis is invited to Thanksgiving dinner. While alone in the kitchen, Alma confronts Ennis about Jack. The two spar, causing Ennis to storm out and cease contact with Alma.

Ennis has a brief romantic relationship with Cassie, a waitress. Jack and Lureen befriend Randall and Lashawn Malone, and it is implied that Jack and Randall have a brief affair. At the end of a tryst disguised as a fishing trip, Ennis says he cannot see Jack again for months due to work demands. The pair argue, before Jack embraces a crying Ennis.

A postcard Ennis sent Jack is returned stamped with ""Deceased"". Ennis calls Jack's phone number. Lureen answers and says Jack died when a car tire exploded in his face. While hearing what happened, Ennis envisions men fatally beating Jack with a tire iron. Lureen says Jack requested his ashes be scattered on Brokeback Mountain.

Ennis visits Jack's parents hoping to carry out his wish. Jack's father declares that Jack's ashes will be interred in a family plot. Jack's mother allows Ennis to visit Jack's bedroom. He finds the shirt Jack thought he left on the mountain, which Jack had secretly kept, nested inside one of his own shirts. Ennis embraces the shirts and silently weeps. Jack's mother enters and sees him holding the two shirts, and allows him to keep them.

Later, 19-year-old Alma Jr. arrives at Ennis's trailer to announce her engagement to Kurt, who works in the oil fields. She asks for her father's blessing and invites him to the wedding. Ennis hesitates to come due to upcoming work commitments, then agrees to attend the wedding. Once Alma Jr. leaves, Ennis goes to the closet where the two shirts hang, Jack's shirt now inside Ennis's. Next to them, tacked to the closet door, is a postcard of Brokeback Mountain. With tears in his eyes, he stares at the mementos, and says, ""Jack, I swear...""","Drama, Romance","starring       = {{Plainlist|

779,The Machinist,"==Plot==
Trevor Reznik is a [[machinist]] whose [[insomnia]] has led to him becoming [[Emaciation|emaciated]]. His appearance and behavior keep his coworkers away, and they eventually turn against him when he is involved in an accident, which causes his coworker, Miller, to lose his left arm. Trevor, who was distracted by an unfamiliar coworker named Ivan, is blamed for the accident. No one at the factory knows of Ivan and there are no records of him. Trevor seems to find comfort in the arms of Stevie, a [[prostitution|prostitute]] with genuine affection for him, and with Maria, a waitress at an airport diner he frequents. He is haunted by brief flashes of recurring imagery, and things such as his car cigarette lighter take on a [[Panphobia|menacing air]]. A mysterious series of [[Post-it note|post-it notes]] appears on his refrigerator, depicting a game of [[Hangman (game)|hangman]].

These vague incidents send him further into paranoia, but he nonetheless attempts to establish a relationship with Maria. Meeting her at an amusement park, Trevor goes with her son Nicholas on a [[dark ride]] called ""Route 666"". The ride starts as a harmless scare ride, but begins to show increasingly disturbing images as it advances, until its flashing lights cause Nicholas to suffer an [[Photosensitive epilepsy|epileptic]] seizure. No longer able to think clearly, Trevor suspects that the bizarre events are a concerted effort to drive him insane, as do recurring clues such as a photo of Ivan fishing with Trevor's coworker Reynolds, which he discovers in Ivan's wallet when Ivan leaves it unattended in a pub. Another near-accident at work causes Trevor to lash out in rage at his coworkers; as a result, he is immediately fired. Increasingly distracted and alienated, Trevor forgets to pay his utility bills and his electricity is disconnected. A dark, viscous liquid begins trickling out of the freezer, coating the refrigerator door with streaks of what appears to be blood.

After several attempts to confront Ivan, Trevor tries to trace his license plate, but runs out of gas while in pursuit of his car. When a [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] clerk insists that personal information cannot be released unless a crime has been committed, Trevor throws himself in front of a car in order to accuse Ivan of committing a [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit and run]]. He files a police report with Ivan's plate number, only to be baffled when he is told that the car in question is his own, and that he had reported it [[Total loss|totaled]] one year ago. He flees the police and goes to Stevie, who bathes and clothes him, but he is disturbed by the discovery of the photo of Ivan and Reynolds framed in her home. Trevor accuses her of conspiring against him. Confused, Stevie says the picture is of Reynolds and Trevor, but he refuses to look at it, and after a violent argument, Stevie throws him out. He goes to the airport diner, but is told by an unfamiliar waitress that they've never had an employee named Maria. The waitress at the counter tells Trevor she has served him every day for a year, and, in all that time, he spoke so little that she thought he was [[muteness|mute]].

Trevor sees Ivan take Nicholas into Trevor's apartment and, fearing the worst, sneaks inside. Nicholas is nowhere to be seen and doesn't respond to Trevor's calls. Trevor confronts Ivan in the bathroom, and Ivan tells him ""you know he's dead"". Trevor, believing Ivan has killed Nicholas and his body is in the bathtub, attacks and seemingly kills him. He pulls back the shower curtain, only to find the bathtub empty. He goes to the refrigerator and opens it to find rotting fish, matching those in the fishing photo, which he at last realizes was of himself with Reynolds, just as Stevie claimed; Trevor hallucinated Ivan's presence in the photo. Trevor takes a rolled-up carpet containing Ivan's body to the ocean to dispose of it, only for the rug to unroll as he does so and reveal nothing inside. Ivan, unharmed, approaches Trevor from behind, and laughs as he tells Trevor that he has some explaining to do.

Trevor stares into a mirror at home, repeating the words, ""I know who you are."" He remembers that one year prior, a then-healthy Trevor ran over and killed a boy (identical to Nicholas) after taking his eyes off the road to use the car's cigarette lighter, which was witnessed by the boy's mother (identical to Maria). Trevor [[Hit and run|fled the scene in his car]], and the resulting guilt became the root of his insomnia, emaciation and repressed memories. Ivan was a figment of Trevor's imagination and a manifestation of his guilt. He fills the missing letters on the hangman note, spelling out ""killer"". The next day, he puts all his personal items in boxes meant to be donated, as he tells his landlord. He briefly considers going to the airport to escape, but instead drives to police headquarters. He is accompanied by a silent but encouraging Ivan, who bids him an approving farewell outside the station as he enters and confesses to the hit-and-run. Two police officers escort Trevor to a cell, where after stating that he only wants to sleep, he does, for the first time in a year.","Drama, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist|

785,The Last Samurai,"== Plot ==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries are usually 400-700 words. -->
In 1876, former [[U.S. Army]] Captain Nathan Algren, a skilled soldier who has become a bitter [[alcoholic]] traumatized by the atrocities he committed and witnessed during the [[American Indian Wars]], is approached by his former commanding officer Colonel Bagley. Bagley asks him to train the newly created [[Imperial Japanese Army]] for a Japanese businessman, Omura, who intends to use the army to suppress [[Satsuma Rebellion|a samurai-headed rebellion]] against Japan's new emperor. Despite his hatred of Bagley, the impoverished Algren takes the job for the money. He is accompanied to Japan by his old friend, [[Sergeant]] Zebulon Gant. Upon arriving, Algren meets Simon Graham, a British translator knowledgeable about the samurai.

Algren learns that the imperial soldiers are simply [[conscripted]] peasants with shoddy training and little discipline. As Algren trains them to shoot, news arrives of a samurai attack on one of Omura's railroads. Against Algren's wishes, Omura sends the soldiers in pursuit of the samurai. The battle turns into a disaster as the recruits are quickly routed and flee, and Gant is killed. Algren [[last stand|fights to the last]] before he is surrounded; wounded and expecting to die, he is taken prisoner when samurai leader Katsumoto spares him.

Algren is taken to Katsumoto's village and, at Katsumoto's request, is taken in and tended to by Taka, Katsumoto's sister, who Algren later realizes is the widow of a samurai he killed before being taken prisoner. While he is poorly treated at first, he eventually gains the samurai's respect and grows close to Katsumoto. With the help of Taka, Algren overcomes his alcoholism and guilt, learns the Japanese language and culture, and is trained in the art of [[kenjutsu]]. He develops sympathy for the samurai, who are upset that the pace of modern technology has eroded the traditions of their society. Algren and Taka develop an unspoken affection for each other.

One night, a group of [[ninja]] infiltrate the village and ambush Katsumoto. Algren saves Katsumoto's life, and then helps defend the village, concluding that Omura is responsible. Katsumoto requests a meeting with [[Emperor Meiji]] in [[Tokyo]]. He brings Algren, intending to release him. Upon arriving in Tokyo, Algren sees that the Imperial Army has become a well-trained and fully equipped force led by Bagley. Katsumoto, to his dismay, discovers that the young and inexperienced emperor has become a puppet of Omura. At a government meeting, Omura orders Katsumoto's arrest for [[Haitorei Edict|carrying a sword in public]] and tells him to perform ''seppuku'' the next day to redeem his honor. Meanwhile, Algren refuses Omura's offer to resume command of the army. After defeating Imperial agents sent by Omura to assassinate him, Algren enlists Graham and Katsumoto's men to free their leader. During the rescue, Katsumoto's son Nobutada is mortally wounded, his sacrifice allowing the others to escape.

As the Imperial Army marches to crush the rebellion, a grieving Katsumoto contemplates ''seppuku.'' Algren convinces him to fight, and pledges to join the samurai in battle. They arrive back at the village, and Algren is reunited with Taka and her children. On the morning of the impending battle, Taka prepares Algren by carefully dressing him in her late husband's [[Ō-yoroi|samurai armor]], and Katsumoto presents him with a newly-forged [[katana|samurai sword]] engraved with an inscription dubbing Algren ""the warrior in which the old ways have joined the new.""

On the battlefield, Algren and Katsumoto meet with Omura and Bagley for [[parley]]; Bagley offers terms of surrender to Katsumoto, which he refuses. The samurai use the Imperial Army's overconfidence to lure them into a trap; the ensuing battle inflicts massive casualties on both sides and forces the imperial soldiers to retreat. Knowing that imperial reinforcements are coming, and defeat is inevitable, Katsumoto orders a [[suicide attack|suicidal]] [[cavalry charge]] on horseback. The samurai withstand an artillery barrage and break through Bagley's line. Algren kills Bagley, but the samurai are quickly mowed down by [[Gatling gun]]s. The imperial captain, previously trained by Algren and horrified by the sight of the dying samurai, orders the soldiers to cease fire, outraging Omura. Katsumoto, mortally wounded, commits ''seppuku'' with Algren's help as the [[Dogeza|soldiers kneel]] in respect.

Later, as trade negotiations conclude, the injured Algren interrupts the proceedings. He presents the emperor with Katsumoto's sword and asks him to remember the traditions for which Katsumoto and his fellow samurai fought and died. The emperor realizes that while Japan should modernize, it can't forget its own culture and history. He rejects the trade offer, and when Omura protests, the emperor tells him he has done enough and threatens to seize his fortune and distribute it to the people. Omura angrily protests, but when the emperor tells him to commit ''seppuku'' to prove his disgrace, he shrinks away in humiliation. After Omura accepts defeat, the emperor asks Algren how Katsumoto died, to which Algren responds that he will instead tell the emperor how he lived.

While various rumors regarding Algren's fate circulate, Graham concludes that Algren had returned to the village to reunite with Taka.","Action, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|

786,The Magdalene Sisters,"==Plot==
In Ireland, 1964, so-called ""fallen"" women are considered sinners who needed to be redeemed. Four young women – Margaret (raped by her cousin), Bernadette (too beautiful and coquettish), Rose (an unmarried mother) and Crispina (an intellectually disabled unmarried mother) – are forced by their families or caretakers into the Magdalene asylum.
The film details the disastrous lives of the four girls whilst they are inmates, portraying their harsh daily regimen and their squalid living conditions at the laundries.

Each woman suffers horrific cruelty and violence from the Mother Superior. Sister Bridget, despite her gentle-faced appearance and outwardly soft-spoken demeanour, is characterised as sadistic and almost inhuman at times, as conveyed through her merciless beating of Rose in full view of Bernadette, or when having shaved Una's head following an escape attempt, she mockingly laughs as Una hopelessly clutches at her fallen hair locks.

Sister Bridget relishes the money the business receives and it is suggested that little of it is distributed appropriately. Those who liken themselves to [[Mary Magdalene]], who deprived herself of all pleasures of the flesh including food and drink, eat hearty breakfasts of buttered toast and bacon while the working women subsist on oatmeal [[Porridge|porridge]]. In one particularly humiliating scene, the women are forced to stand naked in a line after taking a communal shower. The nuns then hold a ""contest"" on who has the most pubic hair, biggest bottom, biggest breasts and smallest breasts. The corruption of the resident priest, Father Fitzroy, is made very clear through his sexual abuse of Crispina. However, as the years pass, automatic [[washing machine]]s start to appear, a modern [[household appliance]] whose growing ubiquity would eventually fatally undermine the economic viability of commercial laundries and make the Magdalene asylums unsustainable.

Three of the girls are shown, to some extent, to triumph over their situation and their captors. Margaret, although she is allowed to leave by the intervention of her younger brother, does not leave the asylum without leaving her mark. When she deliberately asks Sister Bridget to step aside for her to freely pass and is sharply shot down, Margaret falls to her knees in prayer. The Mother Superior is so surprised, she only moves past her after the Bishop tells her to come along. Bernadette and Rose finally decide to escape together, trashing Sister Bridget's study in search for the key to the asylum door and engaging her in a suspenseful confrontation. The two girls escape her clutches and are helped to return to the real world by a sympathetic relative, their story optimistically ending when Rose boards a coach bound for the ferry to [[Liverpool]] and Bernadette becomes an apprentice hairdresser. Crispina's end, however, is not a happy one; she spends the rest of her days in a mental institution (where she was sent to silence her from revealing the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of Father Fitzroy) and dies of [[anorexia]] at the age of 24.<ref>Darby, Alexis, ""The Magdalene Sisters (2002)"".

In 1993, Sam Dawson, a [[Starbucks]] barista with an [[intellectual disability]], and largely based on Benjamin Schwab, becomes the single father of Lucy Diamond Dawson, named after [[the Beatles]] song ""[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]"", following her abandonment by her mother, a homeless woman with whom Sam had a sexual encounter. Sam is well-adjusted and has a supportive group of friends with disabilities as well as a kind, [[agoraphobic]] neighbor, Annie, who takes care of Lucy when Sam cannot. Nearly seven years later in 2001, Sam provides a loving place for precocious Lucy, though she soon surpasses his mental capacity and ability. Other children [[bully]] her for having an intellectually disabled father, and she becomes too embarrassed to accept that she is more advanced than he is. 

In danger of losing [[child custody]], Sam gets advice from his friends and also hires a lawyer, Rita Harrison, whose absorption in her work and neglect of her son reveals her to also struggle with her role as a parent. In an attempt to prove that she is not cold, Rita agrees to take on Sam's case ''[[pro bono]]''. As they work to secure Sam's rights, Sam helps Rita see her own life anew. This includes encouraging her to leave her philandering husband and repair her fractious relationship with her son.

At the trial, due to pressure from the prosecutor, Sam breaks down after becoming convinced he is not capable of raising Lucy. Afterward, she resides in a [[foster home]] with Miranda ""Randy"" Carpenter but tries to convince Sam to help her run away. Sam moves so he is near Lucy, so she continually leaves in the middle of the night to go to his apartment, though he immediately returns her. The foster parents, though, decide not to adopt her as they had planned, and return her to Sam. Randy assures him that she will tell the judge he is the best parent for Lucy. In turn, Sam asks Randy if she will help him raise Lucy because he feels she needs a mother figure.

The final scene depicts a [[soccer]] game, in which Sam [[referees]] and Lucy participates as a player. In attendance are Lucy's former foster family, Sam's friend group, and a newly single Rita with her son.",Drama,"starring       = {{Plainlist|

Sullivan's older son, twelve-year-old Michael Jr., watches the interaction through a hole in the wall. McGovern denies that his brother stole anything from the mob and implies that Connor was responsible. Connor shoots McGovern, forcing Sullivan to shoot the other armed witnesses in self-defense. Sullivan learns that Michael saw the shootout and swears him to secrecy.

Rooney sends Sullivan to collect a debt from Tony Calvino. Connor, jealous and afraid, sends a letter with Sullivan for Calvino. Calvino reads the letter and reaches for his revolver, but Sullivan kills both Calvino and his bodyguard. The letter reads, ""Kill Sullivan and all debts are paid"". Sullivan rushes home. When Sullivan arrives, he discovers that Connor has already murdered his wife, Annie, and their younger son, Peter. Michael was unharmed, as he had arrived home late from detention.

Sullivan and Michael flee Rock Island and head to Chicago to meet mobster [[Frank Nitti]]. Sullivan offers to work for the [[Chicago Outfit]] in exchange for permission to kill Connor. Nitti rejects his offer and advises Sullivan against seeking revenge. Rooney, listening next door with Connor, reluctantly allows Nitti to dispatch [[Contract killing|freelance killer]] Harlen Maguire to kill Sullivan. Maguire tracks the Sullivans to a roadside diner. Maguire and Sullivan converse seemingly casually while Michael stays in the car. Sensing the danger, Sullivan escapes the diner through the bathroom window and slashes Maguire's tires before driving away.

Sullivan begins robbing the banks that hold the Outfit's money; in so doing, Sullivan hopes to pressure the Outfit into withdrawing their protection from Connor. Sullivan teaches Michael to drive so that he can act as a getaway driver. The mob withdraws money from its banks, frustrating Sullivan's plan. Sullivan visits Rooney's accountant, Alexander Rance. Rance stalls Sullivan until Maguire enters with a shotgun. Rance is killed in the crossfire before Sullivan wounds Maguire and escapes with Rooney's ledgers. During the escape, Maguire shoots Sullivan in the shoulder. Michael drives them to a farm after Sullivan collapses from his wound, and an elderly childless husband and wife at the farm help him recover.

The ledgers reveal that Connor has been embezzling from his father. Believing that Rooney will call off the hit on him if he knows the truth, Sullivan heads back to Chicago. Sullivan confronts Rooney at Mass and discovers that Rooney already knows Connor has been robbing him. Rooney states that he expects that Connor will either be killed by Sullivan or be killed by Nitti's men after Rooney has died. Nevertheless, Rooney refuses to give up his son. Rooney urges Sullivan to flee with Michael and raise him to be a better man than either of them is. Sullivan later ambushes and kills Rooney's bodyguards and then Rooney himself. Nitti reveals Connor's location after Sullivan promises that the feud will end with Connor's death. Sullivan goes to the hotel where Connor is hiding and kills him.

Sullivan takes Michael to his aunt's beach house in Perdition. Once there, Sullivan is ambushed and shot by Maguire inside the house as Michael stands on the beach. Michael appears and points a gun at Maguire, and Sullivan fatally shoots Maguire in the back. Michael tells his father that he could not pull the trigger, and Sullivan nods and smiles as he dies in his son's arms.

Michael drives the car back to the elderly couple's farm. In a voiceover, Michael says that he grew up there. Michael adds that he has not held a gun since his father's death. Michael states that when he is asked if his father was a good man, he simply answers, ""He was my father"".","Crime, Drama, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist|

793,Das Experiment,"==Plot==
While reading a newspaper advertisement, taxi driver Tarek Fahd discovers an invitation to participate in an experiment, in which 4,000 [[Deutsche Mark|German mark]]s are offered to the participants of a simulation of a prison situation. The experiment is led by Professor Klaus Thon and his assistant, Dr. Jutta Grimm. He decides to join in.

Tarek participates as a journalist while wearing a pair of glasses with a built-in mini-camera. After a car accident he suffers shortly before the experiment, Tarek meets a woman called Dora. She spends the night with him and Tarek keeps thinking of her, shown in flashbacks. The 20 volunteers are pronounced guards and prisoners, 12 prisoners and 8 guards, and are being observed by a team of scientists.

In the experiment, the prisoners lose their civil rights and have to [[Obedience (human behavior)|obey]] arbitrary rules, such as the obligation to completely finish their meals. The guards are given [[Baton (law enforcement)|nightsticks]], but are told not to use violence in any case. Each prisoner's name is taken away and replaced by a number. Tarek (prisoner number 77) initially refuses to acknowledge the guards' superiority by drinking the milk of one of his co-prisoners because of that prisoner's [[lactose intolerance]], or by throwing his blanket out of his cell to provoke the guards. He befriends his cellmates Steinhoff and Schütte. Psychological changes develop and the situation deteriorates. The circumstances seem to be escalating after only a few days. It becomes clear that limits are not only being reached, but being surpassed when the guards kidnap Tarek from his cell late in the night, order him to strip fully naked, shave his head bald and urinate on him.

The guards become excessively aware of their power and use the prisoners' fear to make them obedient. On both sides, one person is considered dominant. On the prisoners' side, this is Tarek, and on the guards' side, it is the quiet guard Berus, a [[Sadomasochism|sadist]], whose motto during the experiment is: ""Humiliation is the only way we can solve these troubles."" From that moment on, the guards start to use more and more violence against the prisoners. The scientists engage in a discussion whether or not to abort the experiment. Dr. Grimm suggests putting an end to the alarming situation, but Professor Thon refuses to stop the experiment until the violence has reached a maximum.

Dora meanwhile returns to Tarek's apartment and discovers his participation contract for the experiment. She surprises him by showing up for a visit day. Tarek, who was forced to clean the toilet with his own clothes, pleads to the friendly guard Walther Bosch to secretly bring her a message. Berus intercepts Bosch, however, and tells Dora that everything is all right and refuses to let Tarek see Dora.

The situation becomes critical and more violence is involved. The prisoners are being abused and their self-esteem is drastically decreased by the guards' power. Most of the violence is directed against Tarek and he is locked up in solitary confinement inside a ""black box"" resembling a safe. Schütte, protesting this, is beaten severely, bound and gagged with duct tape and forced to sit on a chair. Later he suffocates to death due to his bloody nose drying up while gagged.

Bosch is beaten by the other guards for his ""betrayal"" and is put into confinement. Lars, a member of Thon's team, notices this and attempts to contact Professor Thon, who is attending a conference. The guards, who are aware that the professor cannot be reached by phone, are convinced by Berus that the entire situation is a test put up by Thon's team, in order to make the guards handle an exceptional situation. They take over control of the facility and capture Lars, Dr. Grimm and the other scientists, who are put into confinement as well, and gradually start their own prison in which they engage in brutally sadistic games with total control.

Dora comes to the facility a second time to speak to Tarek and is lured into a room by Berus, where he locks her up. Dr. Grimm is handcuffed and gagged with duct tape while the guard Eckert attempts to rape her. He is stopped by Tarek, who escaped from solitary confinement through the use of a screwdriver that he found inside the ""black box"". Tarek knocks down Eckert and frees Lars, Bosch, Steinhoff, Dr. Grimm and the other prisoners. They manage to escape by removing the wall paneling of one of the cells with the screwdriver. Meanwhile, Professor Thon hears Lars' desperate message in his voicemail and leaves for the facility.

Meanwhile, Steinhoff and Tarek stay behind in order to prevent Berus from coming after them. Professor Thon reaches the facility and demands an explanation from Eckert, who accidentally injures him with a pistol. The fleeing prisoners are ambushed by the guards and trapped. Bosch, who could not keep up with the others, loses his sanity and kills Eckert with a fire extinguisher. Dora then escapes the room she was locked up in, and steals Eckert's gun. She injures one of the guards while he is engaged in fighting Tarek and Steinhoff, leaving only Berus to fight them. Tarek incapacitates Berus, who is nearly choked to death by Steinhoff until Tarek convinces him not to kill Berus.

The film ends with a news break, confirming two deaths (Schütte and Eckert) and three severely injured (Thon, Berus, and Bosch). Both Berus and Thon will be put on trial, Berus for multiple homicides and torture with rape, and Thon for allowing an illegal and unethical experiment. In last scene Dora and Tarek are sitting together happily on the beach.","Drama, Thriller","starring       = [[Moritz Bleibtreu]]<br />[[Justus von Dohnányi]]<br />[[Christian Berkel]]<br />[[Oliver Stokowski]]<br />[[Andrea Sawatzki]]

794,Billy Elliot,"== Plot ==
In 1984, Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old from the fictional Everington in [[County Durham]], England, loves to dance and has hopes of becoming a professional ballet dancer. Billy lives with his widowed father, Jackie, and older brother, Tony, both coal miners out on [[1984–1985 United Kingdom miners' strike|strike]] (the latter being the union delegate). His maternal grandmother lives with them; she has [[Alzheimer's disease]] and had once aspired to be a professional dancer.

Billy's father sends him to the gym to learn boxing, but Billy dislikes the sport. He happens to see a ballet class that is using the gym while their usual basement studio is being used temporarily as a [[soup kitchen]] for the striking miners. Unbeknownst to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet classes. But, passionate about dancing, he secretly continues his lessons with the help of his dance teacher, Sandra Wilkinson.

Sandra believes that Billy is talented enough to study at the [[Royal Ballet School]] in London, but due to Tony's arrest during a clash between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Sandra tells Jackie about the missed opportunity but, fearing that Billy will be considered to be [[gay]], both Jackie and Tony are outraged at the prospect of him becoming a professional ballet dancer.

Over Christmas, Billy learns his best friend, Michael, is gay. Billy is supportive of his friend. Later, Jackie catches Billy and Michael dancing in the gym, and realizes his son is truly gifted. Although stunned at first, he resolves to do whatever it takes to help Billy attain his dream. Sandra tries to persuade Jackie to let her pay for the audition, but he replies that Billy is his son and he does not need charity. Jackie attempts to [[strikebreaker|cross the picket line]] to pay for the trip to London, but Tony stops him. Instead, his fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise some money, and Jackie pawns Billy's mother's jewellery to cover the cost, and Jackie takes him to London to audition.

Although very nervous, Billy performs well. He punches another boy in frustration at the audition, and fears that he has ruined his chances. He is rebuked by the review board and, when asked what it feels like when he is dancing, struggles for words. He says that it is ""like electricity"". Seemingly rejected, Billy returns home with his father. Sometime later, the Royal Ballet School sends him a letter of acceptance, coinciding with the end of the miners' strike, and Billy leaves home to study in London.

In 1998, 25-year-old Billy performs as the Swan in [[Matthew Bourne]]'s ''[[Swan Lake (Bourne)|Swan Lake]]'' with Jackie, Tony, and Michael watching from the audience. As Billy takes the stage, his father is overcome with emotion while the other dancers watch from the wings.","Drama, Music",,"director       = [[Stephen Daldry]]

 <!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 to 700 words. -->
Professional thief [[List of Ocean's characters#Danny Ocean|Danny Ocean]] is released after four years in a New Jersey prison. He travels to Los Angeles and reunites with friend and colleague [[Rusty Ryan (character)|Rusty Ryan]]. They travel to Las Vegas to secure financial backing from wealthy friend Reuben Tishkoff for a multi-million dollar heist to rob three casinos owned by Tishkoff's ruthless rival, Terry Benedict. These are the [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)|Bellagio]], the [[The Mirage|Mirage]], and the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]]. Legally required to have enough cash to cover all casino patrons' bets, Danny estimates that during an upcoming high-profile boxing match, the casinos will hold over $150{{spaces}}million in an underground vault guarded by virtually unassailable security measures and systems. Having been forced out of his casino by Benedict, Tishkoff readily agrees to participate.

Danny and Rusty recruit eight accomplices: con man Frank Catton, retired con man Saul Bloom, auto specialists Virgil and Turk Malloy, explosives expert Basher Tarr, surveillance technician Livingston Dell, acrobat Yen, and pickpocket Linus Caldwell. A precise replica of the vault is built to practice the heist, and team members are assigned to infiltrate or surveil the Bellagio to assess the security, staff routines, and the building's layout. Linus, tasked with tracking Benedict, discovers he is dating Danny's ex-wife, Tess. Believing Danny's motive is driven by wanting to reunite with Tess, Rusty wants to call off the heist, but Danny refuses. Danny later meets with Tess, who is still hurting by their failed relationship, and also Benedict, who has Danny barred from his casinos.

The team commence the heist while Danny enters the Bellagio. Benedict has him detained in a surveillance-free room to be beaten by Bruiser, who secretly works with Danny. Danny reaches the vault elevator through the vent and meets up with Linus, who has infiltrated the casino as a state gaming official. Meanwhile, Saul, disguised as a wealthy foreigner, persuades Benedict to secure a briefcase containing jewels—actually disguised explosives—in the casino vault. Virgil and Turk smuggle Yen into the vault in a casino trolley. Basher triggers a stolen [[electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] device which disables electricity across Las Vegas, including the laser grid protecting the elevator shaft, allowing Danny and Linus to descend to the vault entrance. The pair neutralize the guards and, with Yen, use Saul's explosive ""jewels"" to destroy the vault locks and secure the cash.

Rusty calls Benedict and reveals the robbery, blackmailing him to surrender half the cash to a van waiting outside or else all the money will be blown up. Verifying the compromised vault by camera, Benedict complies, but has his men pursue the van while summoning a SWAT team to retake the vault. During the SWAT team's assault the explosives are detonated, destroying the remaining half of the cash while the thieves seemingly escape. Meanwhile, the van is discovered to be under remote control and the money bags filled with paper advertisements. Benedict dismisses the SWAT team before realizing that the video footage was faked because the Bellagio logo was not on the vault's floor; the footage was the team's replica vault.

It is revealed that, after intercepting the 911 call, the team entered the casino disguised as SWAT members and left the vault with duffel bags containing over $160{{spaces}}million in cash. Danny returns to the secure room before Benedict arrives to confront him. Tess receives a call telling her to watch her TV which shows a surveillance camera feed of Danny tricking Benedict into admitting that he would give up Tess in exchange for the money's return. Unable to connect Danny to the heist, Benedict instead gets him arrested for parole violation; Danny and Tess reconcile before he is taken away. As dawn breaks, the remaining team contemplate their victory before going their separate ways.

Several months later, Danny is released from prison and picked up by Rusty and Tess. They drive off, knowingly followed by Benedict's men.","Crime, Thriller","starring       = <!--- Per poster billing --->{{Plainlist|

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words. -->
Peter Gibbons is a frustrated and unmotivated programmer who works at a Texas-based software company Initech. Unable to stand up to his overcritical girlfriend, Anne, he is in love with local waitress Joanna, but is afraid to speak to her. He is friends with co-workers Samir Nagheenanajar, who hates that no one can pronounce his last name, and Michael Bolton, who hates having the same name as [[Michael Bolton|the famous singer]]. Other co-workers are Milton Waddams, a meek collator who mumbles to himself and is mostly ignored by the rest of the office; and Tom Smykowski, a jaded [[product manager]] who is routinely scared of being fired. The staff suffers under top-heavy, callous management, especially from vice president [[Bill Lumbergh]], whom Peter hates and avoids confronting, as Lumbergh micromanages all his staff in a drab, monotone way. He repeatedly makes Milton move his desk, and assigns him humiliating tasks, while making Peter work almost every weekend.

Anne persuades Peter to attend an occupational hypnotherapy session led by Dr. Swanson. Swanson hypnotizes Peter and tells him to feel relaxed and stop caring about his job until he snaps his fingers. However, Swanson suddenly dies of a heart attack before snapping Peter out of it. Peter sleeps soundly through the next day, ignoring phone calls from Lumbergh and Anne, who angrily breaks up with him while confirming his suspicions that she has been cheating on him.

Two business consultants are brought in to help the company [[layoff|downsize]], and Peter begins dating Joanna. She works at a chain restaurant where she is required to wear ""pieces of flair"": buttons allowing employees to ""express themselves"". Her boss hassles her for not wearing more than the required minimum.

Peter eventually shows up to work and casually disregards office protocol, stealing Lumbergh's parking space, violating the dress code, and removing a cubicle wall that blocks his view out the window. Impressed by Peter's frank insights into Initech's problems, the consultants promote him despite Lumbergh's misgivings; however, Michael and Samir are both laid off. Milton is also expected to be laid off, but it is learned that it already happened five years ago, and neither Milton nor the accounting department was notified due to a payroll glitch. The accounting staff is told to stop Milton's salary payments without telling him. Milton is subjected to further mistreatment, including the confiscation of his beloved red stapler and the constant relocating of his desk, eventually down to the basement.

Tired of being mistreated, Peter, Michael, and Samir decide to take revenge by infecting Initech's accounting system with a [[computer virus]] designed by Michael to divert huge numbers of [[Salami slicing tactics|fractions of pennies]] into a bank account. Peter successfully installs the virus, and on Michael and Samir's last day, he steals a frequently malfunctioning printer, which the three proceed to destroy in a field. At a weekend party, Peter hears rumors from a colleague that Joanna had slept with Lumbergh. When Joanna confirms this, a heated exchange leads to them breaking up. Frustrated with her job, Joanna quits in response to another lecture about her lack of ""flair"".

On Monday, Peter discovers that a [[Software bug|bug]] in Michael's code has caused the virus to steal over $300,000 across the weekend, which guarantees they will be caught. Unable to conceal the crime, Peter decides to accept full responsibility, writing a confession and slipping it under Lumbergh's office door after hours, along with [[traveler's check]]s for the stolen money. Peter learns that the 'Lumbergh' with whom Joanna slept was Ron Lumbergh, another software engineer unrelated to Bill Lumbergh. He meets Joanna, who has started a new job at another restaurant. He apologizes, and they reconcile.

The next morning, Peter drives to Initech expecting to be arrested, but discovers that Milton has burned down the building out of revenge for his mistreatment, destroying all evidence. Peter enjoys a new job as a construction worker with his neighbor Lawrence, while Samir and Michael begin new jobs at Initech's rival Initrode, and Milton, having found the traveler's checks, goes on vacation in Mexico where he still does not get the respect he needs.",Comedy,"starring       = {{Plainlist|

Jake Hoyt, an ambitious [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] police officer, is assigned to work with Detective Alonzo Harris, a highly decorated [[narcotic]]s officer<!--Alonzo's corruption isn't revealed until later in the film; best to reveal this as the plot summary progresses.-->, for a one-day evaluation ahead of Hoyt's anticipated promotion. Driving around in Alonzo's [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo#Third generation (1978–1980)|Monte Carlo]], they begin the day by catching some college kids buying [[marijuana]]. Alonzo confiscates the drugs, puts them into a pipe and tells Jake to smoke it. When Jake refuses, Alonzo threatens him at gunpoint, stating that such a refusal while on the streets would get him killed. Jake smokes the pipe and gets very high. Alonzo laughs, disclosing that it was laced with [[Phencyclidine|PCP]].

After paying a visit to Roger, an ex-cop turned drug dealer, Jake notices a pair of addicts attempting to [[rape]] Letty, a teenage girl in an alley. Jake intervenes while Alonzo watches him get attacked and fight the rapists. After Letty leaves, Alonzo menaces the rapists, but declines to arrest them and Jake collects Letty's wallet from the ground.

Later, Alonzo and Jake apprehend a dealer named Blue, who has [[Crack cocaine|crack rocks]] - revealed when Alonzo makes Blue vomit by sticking a pen down his throat, which fazes Jake - and a loaded handgun in his possession. Rather than go to jail, Blue informs on his employer Kevin ""Sandman"" Miller, who is in prison. Using a fake [[search warrant]], Alonzo steals $40,000 from Sandman's home. At lunch, the two visit Alonzo's mistress Sara and their young son. Alonzo then meets with a trio of corrupt high-ranking police officials he dubs the ""Three Wise Men"". Aware that the [[Russian mafia]] is hunting Alonzo, they suggest he skip town. Alonzo insists he has control of the situation and trades the $40,000 for an [[arrest warrant]].

Alonzo assembles his squad of narcotics officers, and with Jake in tow they return to Roger's house and use the warrant to seize $4 million, a quarter of which Alonzo keeps and shares with his squad. Jake refuses to take a share of the money, worrying Alonzo and the other officers. Alonzo executes Roger after Jake refuses his order to do so, staging the scene with his men to make the shooting look justified. Infuriated, Jake gets into a [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] with the corrupt officers. Alonzo reveals he orchestrated the day's events to have leverage over Jake and threatens him with the police department's post-incident blood test, which will catch the PCP Jake smoked and end his career. Alonzo promises to protect Jake from the drug test in exchange for his cooperation and Jake begrudgingly complies.

Later that evening, Alonzo drives Jake to the home of a [[Sureño]] gangster named Smiley for an errand. As he waits for Alonzo, Jake reluctantly plays [[poker]] with Smiley and his fellow gang members, Sniper and Moreno. Smiley then explains Alonzo's situation: by midnight, Alonzo must pay $1 million to the Russians for killing one of their men over an insult in [[Las Vegas]] or be killed himself. Additionally, Smiley reveals Alonzo has abandoned Jake and paid Smiley to kill him. Jake attempts to flee but is beaten and dragged to the bathroom to be executed. Moreno searches Jake for money and finds the wallet of Letty, who happens to be Smiley's cousin. After calling Letty and confirming that Jake saved her, Smiley releases Jake out of gratitude.

An infuriated Jake returns to Sara's apartment to arrest Alonzo before he leaves to pay the Russians with Roger's money. A gunfight and chase ensue, and Alonzo is eventually subdued on the street while the entire neighborhood gathers to watch. Alonzo offers money to whoever kills Jake{{snd}}to no avail. Jake takes the stolen cash to submit as evidence against Alonzo and the neighborhood gang allows him to leave safely. An enraged Alonzo, realizing his plan has been foiled, suffers a mental breakdown and threatens retaliation against the neighborhood, but they ignore him and walk away during his rant. Alonzo flees for the [[Los Angeles International Airport]] but is ambushed and gunned down by the Russians. Jake returns home as the press reports on Alonzo's death.","Crime, Drama, Thriller","starring       = {{plainlist|

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should not exceed 700 words. -->
Craig Schwartz is an unemployed puppeteer in New York City, in a forlorn marriage with his pet-obsessed wife, Lotte. He finds work as a file clerk for the eccentric Dr. Lester in the Mertin-Flemmer building, on a floor between the 7th and 8th, where the ceiling is very low. He develops an attraction to co-worker Maxine Lund, who does not return his affections. While filing, Craig accidentally discovers a small hidden door. He crawls through it into a tunnel and finds himself inside the mind of actor [[John Malkovich]]. After 15 minutes, Craig is ejected, landing on the side of the [[New Jersey Turnpike]]. He tells Maxine about the door, and she realizes they can sell the experience for profit.

Lotte enters the portal, and based on her experience being John Malkovich, she becomes fascinated with the idea of becoming a man. She and Craig visit Dr. Lester's home, where Lotte finds a room filled with Malkovich memorabilia. Maxine arranges a date with Malkovich while he is inhabited by Lotte, who becomes smitten with Maxine. She reciprocates, but only when Lotte is inside Malkovich; Maxine manipulates him into having sex with her while Lotte is in his mind. Craig, forsaken by both women, locks Lotte in a cage and forces her to set up another tryst with Maxine. He inhabits Malkovich instead and discovers that his puppeteering skills allow him some control over Malkovich.

Meanwhile, the real Malkovich, disturbed by his loss of control, confides in his friend [[Charlie Sheen]] and becomes suspicious of Maxine. Malkovich follows her to the office, where she and Craig are charging customers to use the portal. When Malkovich enters it himself, he finds himself in a world where everyone looks like him and says only ""Malkovich."" After he is ejected, he demands that Craig close the portal, but Craig refuses. Lotte is freed by her pet chimpanzee and warns Maxine that Craig is inhabiting Malkovich, but Maxine is attracted to Craig's ability to control him.

Lotte confronts Dr. Lester, who reveals that he is, in fact, Captain Mertin, who, having discovered the portal to a ""vessel body"" in the late 1800s, erected the Mertin-Flemmer building to conceal it. He has obtained immortality by moving from one body to the next, which becomes ""ripe"" on the host's 44th birthday, allowing him to take possession. If he were to enter the portal past midnight on that day, he would instead be trapped in the next newborn vessel, helpless inside the new host's mind. This time, Lester has invited a group of friends to join him in occupying Malkovich once he turns 44, and Lotte warns them that Craig has taken control.

Craig discovers he can occupy Malkovich indefinitely. Inhabiting him over the next eight months, he makes Malkovich into a world-class puppeteer and marries Maxine. Later, Maxine discovers that she is pregnant. On Malkovich's 44th birthday, Lester and Lotte kidnap Maxine. They call to demand that Craig leave Malkovich, threatening to kill Maxine, but he hangs up. In desperation, Lotte decides to shoot Maxine, who escapes into the portal. Lotte pursues her through Malkovich's subconscious before they are both ejected. Maxine confesses that she kept her unborn child because it was conceived while Lotte was in Malkovich's mind, meaning that it is Lotte's child, too, and the women cement their love for each other.

Craig, believing Maxine is still in danger, leaves Malkovich's mind, allowing Lester and his friends to enter. Discovering that Maxine has discarded him for Lotte, Craig swears to reenter the portal to take back Malkovich's mind. Seven years later, an older Malkovich, now inhabited by multiple people, tells Sheen about Lester and his friends' plan to extend their lives via the portal, which now leads to the mind of Maxine's daughter Emily. Craig, who entered the portal too late, is permanently trapped inside Emily, forced to watch Lotte and Maxine live happily together.","Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","starring       = {{plainlist|

[[Misanthropy|Misanthropic]] New York City best-selling romance novelist Melvin Udall has [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD). He uses soap bars only once to wash his hands, uses paper towels to touch public restroom faucets and door handles, avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks, has rituals with switches and locks, and sticks to rigid routines. Melvin always eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant while bringing his own plastic flatware. Carol Connelly is the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his odd and rude behavior.

Melvin's apartment neighbor, gay artist Simon Bishop, starts working with a new model, Vincent Lopiano. Vincent uses the opportunity to case Simon's apartment and give entry to his friends, who assault and nearly kill Simon during the robbery. Simon's agent, Frank Sachs, intimidates Melvin into caring for Simon's beautiful [[Griffon Bruxellois]] (pet dog), Verdell, while Simon is hospitalized. Although Melvin initially does not enjoy caring for the dog, he becomes emotionally attached to it. When Simon is released from the hospital, Melvin tolerates a neighborly relationship with Simon so he can continue to see Verdell.

Melvin's OCD need for routine and aversion to change is aggravated when Carol decides to work closer to her home in Brooklyn to be more accessible for her acutely [[asthma]]tic son, Spencer. Unable to adjust to a different waitress, Melvin arranges to pay for Spencer's considerable medical expenses for at-home care―if Carol returns to the restaurant. While Carol is overwhelmed by Melvin’s generosity, thanking him profusely, she is suspicious of his motives, declaring emphatically that she will never have sex with him. A humiliated Melvin admonishes her that she, not he, has made the situation personal.

Meanwhile, Simon’s injuries, lack of medical insurance, and high medical bills cause him to go bankrupt and fall into depression. Frank persuades him to go to Baltimore to ask his estranged parents for money. Bullied by Frank, Melvin reluctantly agrees to take recuperating Simon to Baltimore. Frank lends Melvin his [[Saab 900#Variants|Saab 900 convertible]] for the trip. Irrationally fearing Simon may make a pass at him (his cover story), Melvin invites Carol along on the trip, reminding her that she owes him a favor, and she reluctantly accepts. Relationships develop among the three on the trip as Simon discusses the root of his estrangement with his parents, who cannot accept his homosexuality; Carol commiserates; and Melvin’s acerbic remarks gradually become more sympathetic.

Once in Baltimore, Carol persuades Melvin to take her out for dinner. Melvin's conversation during the dinner initially flatters her—he tells her that her “no sex oath” made him start taking medication to become a better man. When Carol presses Melvin to admit that he invited her on the trip because he had feelings for her, however, an embarrassed and fumbling Melvin again clumsily deflects, awkwardly responding that he invited her along to maybe have sex with Simon to cure his homosexuality. Upset at the implication that her sexual favors are for sale, Carol abruptly leaves. She goes to Simon’s hotel room for consolation, and their emotional intimacy rekindles his creative desire to paint. He sketches Carol, nearly nude, making her feel her femininity appreciated in a nonsexual way. With confidence inspired by Carol, Simon briefly reconnects with his mother, without asking her for money, telling her that he will be fine.

After returning to New York, Carol tells Melvin that he disparages her and she does not want him in her life anymore. Since Simon is still broke and his apartment has been sublet, Melvin arranges for Simon to stay in his spare bedroom. On learning of Melvin’s enormous gesture and sign of growth, Carol regrets her harshness and calls Melvin to apologize. The relationship between Melvin and Carol remains complicated until Simon persuades Melvin to declare his love for her. Melvin goes to see Carol, who hesitantly agrees to try and establish a relationship with him. She is encouraged by her mother, who declares that no relationship is perfect. The film ends with Melvin and Carol walking together. As he opens the door at an early morning pastry shop for Carol, he realizes that he has stepped on a crack in the pavement, but does not seem to mind.","Comedy, Drama, Romance","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!-- per poster block-->

808,The Fifth Element,"==Plot==
In 1914, aliens known as Mondoshawans meet their contact on Earth, a priest of a secret order, at an [[ancient Egypt]]ian temple. They take the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil<!--lower case--> that appears every five thousand years, promising to protect it and return it before the great evil's re-emergence. The weapon consists of the four [[classical element]]s, as four engraved stones, plus a [[sarcophagus]] containing a ""fifth element"".

In the 23rd century,{{efn|The film's opening scene states the year is 1914 and the following scene in space states it is ""300 years later"". However, Korben's alarm clock shows the year as 2263. The year is given as 2257 on the DVD sleeve notes published by Pathé in 1997, and as 2259 by Besson in ''The Story of The Fifth Element''.}} the great evil appears in deep space as a giant living fireball. It destroys an armed Earth spaceship as it heads to Earth. The Mondoshawans' current human contact on Earth, priest Vito Cornelius, informs the President of the Federated Territories of the great evil's history and the weapon that can stop it.

On their way to Earth, a Mondoshawan spacecraft carrying the weapon is ambushed and destroyed by a crew of Mangalores, alien mercenaries hired by Earth industrialist Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, who is working for the great evil. A severed hand in metal armor from the wreckage of the spacecraft is brought to New York City. From this, the government uses biotechnology to recreate the original occupant of the sarcophagus, a humanoid woman named Leeloo, who remembers her previous life. Alarmed by the unfamiliar surroundings and high security, she escapes and jumps off a ledge, crashing into the [[Flying car (aircraft)|flying taxicab]] of Korben Dallas, a former major in Earth's [[Special Forces]].

Dallas delivers Leeloo to Cornelius and his apprentice, David, who recognizes her as the Fifth Element. As Leeloo recuperates, she tells Cornelius that the stones were not on board the Mondoshawan ship. Simultaneously, the Mondoshawans inform Earth's government the stones were entrusted to an alien opera singer, the diva Plavalaguna. Zorg reneges on his deal with the Mangalores for failing to obtain the stones and kills some of them. Earth's military sends Dallas to meet Plavalaguna; a rigged radio contest provides a cover, awarding Dallas a luxury vacation aboard a flying hotel on planet Fhloston, accompanied by flamboyant talk-show host Ruby Rhod. It includes a concert by Plavalaguna, and learning that Leeloo shares his mission, Dallas lets her accompany him. Cornelius instructs David to prepare the temple, then stows away on the luxury spaceship. The Mangalore crew, pursuing the stones for themselves, also illegally board the ship.

During the concert, the Mangalores attack, and Plavalaguna is killed. Dallas extracts the stones from her body and kills the Mangalore leader, causing the others to surrender. Zorg arrives, shoots Leeloo, and activates a [[time bomb]]. He flees with a carrying case he presumes contains the stones but returns when he discovers it is empty. Dallas finds Leeloo traumatized and escapes with her, Cornelius, Rhod, and the stones in Zorg's private spaceship. Zorg deactivates his bomb, but a dying Mangalore sets off his own, destroying the hotel and killing Zorg.

As the great evil approaches Earth, the four meet David at the temple. They deploy the stones, but Leeloo, having learned of humanity's history of cruelty, has given up on life. Dallas declares his love for her and kisses her. Leeloo combines the power of the stones, emitting divine light onto the great evil and defeating it. She and Dallas are hailed as heroes, and as dignitaries wait to greet them, the two passionately embrace in a recovery chamber.","Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","starring       = {{Plain list|<!-- Per opening and end credits -->

818,Short Cuts,"==Plot==
The film begins with a fleet of helicopters spraying for [[Ceratitis capitata|medflies]], which brings various characters together along the flight path.

Dr. Ralph Wyman and his wife, Marian, meet Stuart Kane, an unemployed salesman, and Claire Kane, a party clown, at a concert Zoe Trainer performs on [[cello]]. They impulsively decide to have a Sunday dinner date. Meanwhile, Marian's sister, Sherri, is married to a cheating cop named Gene, who is having an affair with Betty Weathers, while Betty is divorcing one of the helicopter pilots, Stormy.

Among the other characters are Doreen Piggot, a waitress married to an alcoholic limo driver named Earl, and television commentator Howard Finnigan, who lives next door to cabaret singer Tess and her daughter Zoe. Jerry Kaiser, the pool cleaner, is married to Lois, who works from home as a [[phone sex]] operator. Jerry and Lois are friends with Honey, Doreen's daughter, and her husband Bill, a makeup artist.

Tragedy strikes when Casey, Howard and Anne's young son, is accidentally hit by Doreen's car. Although he initially seems fine, Casey later falls unconscious at home. The concerned parents rush him to the hospital, where he remains [[Coma|comatose]]. In the midst of this, the baker Andy Bitkower repeatedly calls the Finnigans to inform them about their ordered cake. However, Howard, wanting to keep the phone line free, abruptly ends the calls, leading to frustration on Andy's part.

Howard's estranged father, Paul, arrives at the hospital and recalls an incident from Howard's childhood, which caused the rift between them. Meanwhile, Stuart and his friends, Gordon and Vern, harass Doreen at the diner before leaving for a fishing trip. During their excursion, they discover the body of a young woman. Contemplating what to do, they decide to tie her to the rocks and continue fishing, only reporting the incident later. Stuart eventually confesses to Claire, who is appalled by their actions and visits the funeral home out of guilt.

Stormy, one of the helicopter pilots, pays a destructive visit to Betty's house while she is away with their son. Gene abandons the family dog due to its barking, but eventually retrieves it after his children express distress. The Wymans have a heated argument before their dinner party with the Kanes, during which Marian admits to having an affair. Both couples resort to heavy drinking, and the party lasts throughout the night.

A glimmer of hope arises when Casey's eyes flutter, but tragically, he suddenly dies, leaving Howard and Anne devastated. Meanwhile, Zoe, overwhelmed by her mother's alcoholism, Casey's death, and her own isolation, commits suicide by starting her car engine inside the garage. Her mother discovers her lifeless body and drinks herself into a [[stupor]].

When Honey picks up pictures from the [[fotomat]], she finds them mixed up with Gordon's. Honey is shocked to find pictures of the submerged body from Gordon's fishing trip while Gordon equally shocked to find pictures of Honey appearing severely beaten. Disturbed, they part ways but memorize each other's license plates. Later, at a picnic, Jerry and Bill encounter two young women they had met earlier. Bill and one of the girls walk away, only to hear her scream moments before Jerry kills her with a rock. Suddenly, a major earthquake strikes, causing chaos. The aftermath suggests that Jerry's act may be mistakenly attributed to the falling rocks during the earthquake.","Comedy, Drama","starring       = {{plainlist|

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->
[[Charles Dickens]] and his friend [[Rizzo the Rat|Rizzo]] [[Narration|narrate]] the story of [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], a greedy, grumpy, penny-pinching and lonely moneylender of nineteenth century [[London]], who in particular does not share the merriment of Christmas. On [[Christmas Eve]] he rejects his nephew Fred's invitation to Christmas dinner, dismisses two gentlemen collecting money for charity, and tosses a wreath at a carol-singing [[List of Muppets|Bean Bunny]]. His kind, humble employee [[Bob Cratchit]] and the other bookkeepers request to not work on Christmas Day, since there will be no business for Scrooge on the day, to which he reluctantly agrees.

That night Scrooge encounters the shackled ghosts of his late business partners, [[Jacob Marley|Jacob and Robert Marley]], in his bed chambers. They warn him to repent his wicked ways or be condemned to suffer in the afterlife as they do and that three spirits will visit him during the night. At one o'clock Scrooge is visited by the childlike [[Ghost of Christmas Past]], who shows him visions of his childhood and early adult life. Along with Dickens and Rizzo, they visit his lonely school days and then his time as an employee at Fozziwig's [[rubber chicken]] factory. There, at Fozziwig's Christmas party, Scrooge meets a young woman named Belle, with whom he falls in love but loses as he chooses money more over her. Seeing this, a tearful Scrooge tells the Ghost to leave him and is returned to his home.

Scrooge next meets the gigantic, merry [[Ghost of Christmas Present]], who shows him the joys and wonder of Christmas Day. Scrooge and the Ghost visit Fred's house, where Scrooge is made fun of for his stinginess and general ill will toward all. Scrooge and the spirit then visit Bob Cratchit's house, learning his family is content with the little they have. Scrooge also takes pity on Bob's ill son [[Tiny Tim (A Christmas Carol)|Tiny Tim]], whom the Ghost comments will soon die if things continue the way they are. The Ghost leaves Scrooge with the [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]], who takes Scrooge into the future where a recent death elicits no sympathy from the inhabitants of London and the stolen possessions of the deceased are sold to a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] named Old Joe. The Ghost also shows Scrooge the Cratchits' home, where they find Bob and his family mourning Tiny Tim.

Scrooge is led to the cemetery, where the Ghost points out the neglected grave of the unloved man; Scrooge wipes the snow away on the tombstone to see it bears his own name. Scrooge tearfully vows to change his ways and suddenly finds himself back in his bedroom, where he discovers it is Christmas Day. Filled with glee, he begins spreading happiness and joy around London, agreeing to give money to the gentlemen's charity and reconciling with Fred and Fozziwig. Scrooge has Bean buy the poulterer's prized turkey and they, along with Dickens, Rizzo and the gentlemen, deliver it to Bob's family. Scrooge tells Bob he will raise his salary and pay off his mortgage, Dickens tells that Tiny Tim escaped death thanks to Scrooge's new generosity, and everyone celebrates Christmas together.","Comedy, Drama, Family","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--PER POSTER BILLING-->

At the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] in [[Cuba]], [[Private (rank)|Private]] William Santiago, a [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]], is tied up and beaten in the middle of the night. After he is found dead, [[Lance Corporal]] Harold Dawson and [[Private First Class]] Louden Downey are accused of his murder and face a [[Courts-martial of the United States|court-martial]]. Their defense is assigned to [[United States Navy]] [[United States Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps|JAG Corps]] [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Daniel Kaffee, a callow lawyer with a penchant for [[plea bargain]]s.

Another JAG attorney, [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Joanne Galloway, Kaffee's superior, suspects something is amiss. Santiago died after he broke the [[chain of command]] to ask to be transferred away. [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Matthew Markinson advocated for Santiago to be transferred, but [[Base commander|Base Commander]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Nathan Jessep ordered Santiago's platoon commander, Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick, to ""train"" Santiago on the basis they are all at fault for Santiago's substandard performance. Galloway suspects that Dawson and Downey carried out a ""code red"" order: a violent [[extrajudicial punishment]]. Galloway is bothered by Kaffee's blasé approach, and Kaffee resents Galloway's interference.

Kaffee and Galloway question Jessep and others at Guantanamo Bay and are met with contempt from the colonel. When Kaffee negotiates a plea bargain with the prosecutor, [[United States Marine Corps Judge Advocate Division|US Marine Judge Advocate]] Captain Jack Ross, Dawson and Downey refuse, insisting that Kendrick gave them the ""code red"" order, that they never intended to kill Santiago, and that it would be dishonorable to pursue a plea bargain. Kaffee intends to get removed as counsel, but at the arraignment, Kaffee unexpectedly enters a plea of not guilty for the defendants. He says that he was chosen to handle the case because he was expected to accept a plea, and the matter would then be kept quiet.

Markinson meets Kaffee in secret and says that Jessep never ordered a transfer for Santiago. The defense establishes that Dawson had been denied promotion for smuggling food to a Marine who had been sentenced to be deprived of food. Dawson is portrayed in a good light, and the defense, through Downey, proves that ""code reds"" had been ordered before. But under cross-examination, Downey says that he was not present when Dawson received the supposed ""code red"" order. Markinson, ashamed that he failed to protect a Marine under his command and unwilling to testify against Jessep, his longtime friend, commits suicide before he can testify.

Without Markinson's testimony, Kaffee believes the case lost. He returns home in a drunken stupor, lamenting that he fought the case instead of taking a deal. Galloway encourages Kaffee to call Jessep as a witness, despite the risk of being court-martialed for challenging a high-ranking officer without evidence.

At the [[Washington Navy Yard]] court, Jessep spars with Kaffee's questioning, but is unnerved when Kaffee points out a contradiction in his testimony. Kaffee also calls into question Jessep's claim that Santiago was to be put on the first flight home. Upon further questioning, and disgusted by Kaffee's attitude, Jessep extols the military's, and his own, importance to national security. Kaffee asks if Jessep ordered the ""code red"", to which he bellows ""You're goddamn right I did!"". Jessep tries to leave the courtroom but is arrested.

Dawson and Downey are cleared of the murder and conspiracy charges but found guilty of ""[[conduct unbecoming]]"" and will be [[dishonorable discharge|dishonorably discharged]]. Downey does not understand what they did wrong; Dawson says that they failed to defend those too weak to fight for themselves. Kaffee tells Dawson that it is not necessary to wear a patch on one's arm to have honor. Dawson acknowledges Kaffee as an officer and renders a salute. Kaffee and Ross exchange pleasantries before Ross departs to arrest Kendrick.","Drama, Thriller","starring       = {{Plain list|

Evelyn Couch is a timid housewife in her 40s in 1980s [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. Her husband Ed has an aunt living at an Alabama nursing home, where Evelyn meets elderly Ninny Threadgoode. Over several encounters, Ninny tells Evelyn about the long-abandoned town of Whistle Stop and its residents.{{efn|The film's subplot concerns Evelyn's dissatisfaction with her marriage, her life, her growing confidence, and the developing friendship between her and Ninny. The timeline switches between the present and a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] story set between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].}}

Ninny's tale begins with [[tomboy]] Idgie, the youngest member of the Threadgoode family. She and Ruth Jamison are devastated when Idgie's beloved older brother and Ruth's boyfriend Buddy is killed by a train. Idgie remains socially withdrawn well into her adolescence. At the Threadgoode family's request, the straitlaced Ruth intervenes.

Idgie initially rebuffs Ruth's attempt at friendship, but over the summer they gradually develop a deep attachment. Ruth eventually moves to [[Valdosta, Georgia]], to marry Frank Bennett. When Idgie visits, she discovers that Frank habitually abuses the pregnant Ruth.

Against Frank's violent attempts to stop her, Idgie, together with her brother Julian and Big George, rescue Ruth who returns to Whistle Stop with them, where her baby, Buddy Jr., is born. Papa Threadgoode gives Idgie money to start a business and help care for Ruth and Buddy Jr. She and Ruth open the Whistle Stop Cafe, employing the family cook, Sipsey, and her son, Big George, whose excellent barbecue becomes widely popular.

Frank comes to Whistle Stop to kidnap his infant son, but an unseen assailant thwarts his attempt, and he is soon reported missing. About five years later, Frank's truck surfaces in a nearby river. Idgie becomes a suspect, having publicly threatened Frank for beating Ruth. Sheriff Grady Kilgore detains both her and Big George. He offers to release Idgie and pin Frank's supposed murder solely on Big George, but she refuses.

During the subsequent trial, Reverend Scroggins provides false testimony that supports both Idgie's and Big George's alibis. Taking into account Frank's reputation for drunkenness and his body never being found, the judge rules his probable death as accidental and drops all charges against Idgie and Big George.

Shortly after the trial, Ruth is diagnosed with terminal cancer and soon dies. When trains stop running through Whistle Stop, the café closes, and the townsfolk drift away. Ninny's story concludes, but not before Frank's fate is revealed. When Frank attempted to kidnap Buddy Jr., Sipsey hit him over the head with a cast-iron skillet, killing him. Frank's truck was pushed into the river, and Idgie convinced Big George to butcher and barbecue Frank's body, which they later served to Sheriff Curtis Smoot, who relentlessly investigated Frank's disappearance. Smoot proclaimed the meal as the best barbecue he ever ate.

Evelyn discovers Ninny was discharged from the nursing home. During her stay there, Ninny's house was condemned and demolished unbeknownst to her. Evelyn finds Ninny where the house once stood. She wants her to live with her and Ed, to which Ninny agrees.

They pass by Ruth's grave which is freshly adorned with a jar containing honey and a honeycomb. A card reads, ""I'll always love you, the Bee Charmer"". The Bee Charmer was Ruth's nickname for Idgie, revealing that Idgie is still alive and is possibly Ninny. As they leave, Ninny recollects how after Ruth died the cafe closed and all the townspeople eventually left.",Drama,"starring       = {{Plainlist|<!-- per poster -->

827,Barton Fink,"== Plot ==
<!-- Please do NOT add significantly to this plot summary. We're trying to keep it short! (See WP:SS for more info) -->
In 1941, up-and-coming [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] playwright Barton Fink accepts a contract from Capitol Pictures in Hollywood to write film scripts for a thousand dollars per week. Upon moving to Los Angeles, Fink settles into the cheap Hotel Earle. His room's only decoration is a small painting of a woman on the beach, arm raised to block the sun. Fink is assigned to a wrestling film by his new boss Jack Lipnick, but he finds difficulty in writing for the unfamiliar subject. He is distracted by sounds coming from the room next door, and he phones the front desk to alert them of the disturbing sounds. His neighbor, Charlie Meadows, the source of the noise, visits Fink to apologize. During their conversation, Fink proclaims his affection for ""the common man"", and Meadows describes his life as an insurance salesman.

[[File:John Goodman 1989.jpg|thumb|upright|The Coen brothers wrote the role of Charlie Meadows for actor John Goodman, in part because of the ""warm and friendly image that he projects for the viewer"".<ref name=""CN176"" />]]
Still unable to proceed beyond the first lines of his script, Fink consults producer Ben Geisler for advice. Irritated, the frenetic Geisler takes him to lunch and orders him to consult another writer for assistance. Fink meets the novelist W. P. Mayhew by chance in the bathroom. They briefly discuss movie-writing and arrange a second meeting later in the day. Fink later learns from Mayhew's secretary, Audrey Taylor, that Mayhew suffers from [[alcoholism]] and that Taylor [[Ghostwriter|ghostwrote]] some of his scripts. With one day left before his meeting with Lipnick to discuss the film, Fink phones Taylor and begs her for assistance. Taylor visits him at the Earle and they have sex. Fink awakens the next morning to find that Taylor has been violently murdered. Horrified, he summons Meadows and asks for help. Meadows is repulsed but disposes of the body and orders Fink to avoid contacting the police.

After Fink has a meeting with an unusually supportive Lipnick, Meadows announces to Fink that he is going to New York for several days, and asks him to watch over a package he is leaving behind. Soon afterwards, Fink is visited by two police detectives, who inform him that Meadows's real name is Karl ""Madman"" Mundt. Mundt is a serial killer whose ''[[modus operandi]]'' is [[Decapitation|beheading]] his victims. Stunned, Fink places the box on his desk without opening it and he begins writing feverishly. Fink produces the entire script in one sitting and he goes out for a night of celebratory dancing, returning to find the detectives in his room, who inform him of Mayhew's murder and accuse Fink of complicity with Mundt.

As the hotel is suddenly engulfed in flames, Mundt appears and kills the detectives with a shotgun, after which he mentions that he had paid a visit to Fink's parents and uncle in New York. Fink leaves the still-burning hotel, carrying the box and his script. Shortly thereafter he attempts to telephone his family, but there is no answer. In a final meeting with Lipnick, who has been conscripted by the [[United States Army Reserve]] to serve as a [[colonel]] in the [[Second World War]], Fink's script (which is suggested to be a nearly word-for-word copy of one of his Broadway plays) is lambasted as ""a fruity movie about suffering"", and he is informed that he is to remain in Los Angeles; although Fink will remain under contract, Capitol Pictures will not produce anything he writes until he ""grows up a little"". Dazed, Fink wanders onto a beach, still carrying the package. He meets a woman who looks just like the one in the picture on his wall at the Earle, and she asks about the box. He tells her he does not know what it contains nor who owns it. He asks her if she has ever been in pictures, and she says no, with perceptible disinterest.  She then assumes the pose from the picture on the hotel room wall.","Comedy, Drama, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist|

828,Miller's Crossing,"==Plot==
<!-- Plot summaries should be 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->
The year is 1929, Tom Reagan is the right-hand man for [[Irish mob]]ster Leo O'Bannon, a [[political boss]] who runs an unnamed U.S. city during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].  Leo sets off a mob war when he extends protection to his girlfriend Verna's brother, a bookie named Bernie Bernbaum, who is skimming off the [[match fixing]] scheme of Leo's rival, the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian gangster]] Johnny Caspar.  The situation is further complicated by the fact that behind Leo's back, Verna is also sleeping with Tom.

Despite his own relationship with Verna, Tom presses Leo to give up her brother to Caspar. When the war heats up, with an assassination attempt on Leo, Tom tries to persuade Leo that he is foolish to protect Bernie on Verna's behalf, making the point by revealing his affair with her. Leo publicly beats Tom and cuts ties with both him and Verna.

Cast out and needing work, Tom turns to Caspar. As a loyalty test, Caspar commands Tom to kill Bernie, an awkward request given Tom's relationship with Bernie's sister. With Caspar's henchmen in tow, Tom leads Bernie to his execution in the woods at a spot called Miller's Crossing. Bernie grovels for his life, pleading ""Look in your heart"". Tom fakes the killing by firing his gun into the ground and orders Bernie to leave town. Caspar's henchmen, who are within earshot but cannot see the two men, are fooled and neglect to check for the body before leaving with Tom.

With Leo weakened, Caspar takes his place as city boss, controlling the police and using them to destroy Leo's operations.

Within Caspar's gang, there is tension between Tom and Caspar's trusted enforcer, the brutal Eddie Dane (""the Dane""). Upon learning that his men didn't actually see Tom kill Bernie, the Dane takes Tom back to Miller's Crossing to verify that Bernie's body is there. Tom expects to find no corpse and to be executed for it, but instead the group finds a decomposing body that had been shot in the face and disfigured beyond recognition by birds. The Dane and his men assume the body is that of Bernie, but it is actually that of the Dane's lover, a man named Mink, whom Bernie had secretly killed and placed as a decoy where his own body should have been. Tom is now vulnerable if the Dane or Caspar discovers the identity of the body, a fact that Bernie uses in an attempt to blackmail Tom into killing Caspar.

With Bernie supposedly dead, someone continues to cut into Caspar's match fix, and Tom and the Dane each try to convince Caspar that the other is behind it. Tom uses the sudden disappearance of Mink to sow suspicion about the Dane by insinuating that Mink has gone into hiding after he and the Dane betrayed Caspar. Caspar must decide between Tom and the Dane, a dilemma he resolves by shooting the Dane in the head as Tom looks on.

Tom then thins out his rivals by engineering a surprise meeting between Bernie and Caspar, knowing that the first one to be seen by the other is likely to be killed. Shortly after the arranged time, Tom arrives to discover that Bernie has killed Caspar. Tom tricks Bernie into surrendering his gun and declares his intent to kill him in retribution for his blackmail. Bernie again begs for mercy, saying, as he did at Miller's Crossing, ""Look in your heart"", but this time Tom asks rhetorically ""What heart?"" and shoots him dead.

With Caspar and the Dane dead, Leo resumes his post as the only boss in town. At Bernie's burial, Verna, now back in Leo's good graces, reacts coldly to Tom and walks back to her car. Leo notifies Tom that Verna has proposed to marry him. He offers Tom his job back but Tom turns him down and stays behind, watching Leo as he walks away.","Crime, Drama, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist|

In 1947 Los Angeles, animated cartoon characters, or ""[[Animated cartoon|toons]]"", co-exist with humans, often employing their skills to entertain as film stars. Private detective [[Eddie Valiant]], once a staunch ally of the toons alongside his brother and co-worker Teddy, has become a depressed alcoholic following Teddy's murder by an unknown toon five years earlier. Maroon Cartoon Studios owner R.K. Maroon, upset about the recent poor performance of his toon star [[Roger Rabbit]], hires Eddie to investigate rumors that Roger's glamorous toon wife, [[Jessica Rabbit|Jessica]], is having an affair with Marvin Acme, owner of both the [[Acme Corporation]] and Toontown, the animated metropolis in which toons reside.

After watching Jessica perform at The Ink and Paint Club, Eddie secretly photographs her and Acme playing [[patty-cake]]. He shows the pictures to Roger, who becomes distraught and flees, refusing to believe Jessica was unfaithful. The next morning, Acme is found murdered and evidence at the scene implicates Roger as a suspect. Eddie meets [[Judge Doom]], the sinister human [[judge]] of Toontown—having bribed the electorate to gain their votes—and his five [[Weasels (Disney)|weasel]] minions, the Toon Patrol. Doom confirms he plans to execute Roger using the ""Dip"", a chemical concoction of [[acetone]], [[benzene]], and [[turpentine]] which is capable of destroying the otherwise invulnerable toons.

Roger's toon co-star, Baby Herman, suggests to Eddie that Acme's missing [[Will and testament|will]]—which supposedly bequeaths Toontown to the toons—may have been the killer's true motive. Eddie returns to his office and finds Roger waiting. Roger insists he has been framed and Eddie reluctantly agrees to help after finding evidence of Acme's will; he hides Roger in a bar tended by his girlfriend, Dolores. Jessica tells Eddie that Maroon threatened Roger's career unless she posed for the compromising photos. Meanwhile, Dolores's research uncovers that Cloverleaf Industries recently bought the city's [[Pacific Electric]] railway system and will purchase Toontown at midnight unless Acme's will is found. Doom and the Toon Patrol find Roger, but he and Eddie escape with help from Benny, a toon [[taxi]] cab. Sheltering in a local [[movie theater]], Eddie sees a newsreel of Maroon selling his studio to Cloverleaf.

While Eddie goes to the studio to interrogate Maroon, Jessica abducts Roger. Maroon denies involvement in Acme's murder, admitting he intended to [[blackmail]] Acme into selling his company as otherwise Cloverleaf would not buy the studio. Maroon is assassinated and Eddie spots Jessica fleeing the scene. Assuming she is the assailant, he reluctantly follows her into Toontown, choosing to discard the last of his alcohol. After saving Eddie from being shot by Doom, Jessica reveals her actions were to ensure Roger's safety and it was Doom who killed Acme and Maroon. Acme gave his will to Jessica for safety but, when she examined it, the paper was blank.

Doom and the Toon Patrol capture Jessica and Eddie, bringing them to Acme's factory. Doom reveals he is [[Chief executive officer|the sole shareholder]] of Cloverleaf and plans to erase Toontown with a Dip-spraying machine so he can build a [[interstate|freeway]] in its place, and decommission the railway system to force people to use it. When Roger unsuccessfully attempts to save Jessica, the couple is tied onto a hook in front of the machine's sprayer. Eddie distracts the weasels by performing a comedic [[vaudeville]] act full of pratfalls, causing them to die of laughter before he kicks their leader into the Dip. Doom is flattened by a [[steamroller]] while fighting with Eddie, but he survives, revealing he is actually a disguised toon and Teddy's murderer. Struggling against Doom's toon abilities, Eddie empties the machine's Dip supply, spraying and dissolving Doom to death. The machine crashes through the wall into Toontown, where it is destroyed by a [[passenger train]].

As police and toons gather at the scene, Eddie realizes that Acme's will was written on the blank paper in temporarily [[invisible ink]], confirming the toons inherit Toontown. Having regained his sense of humor, Eddie happily enters Toontown alongside Dolores, Roger, Jessica, and the toons.","Animation, Adventure, Comedy","starring = {{Plainlist|<!--Per poster billing.-->

832,The Last Emperor,"==Plot==
By 1950, the 44-year-old [[Puyi]], former Emperor of China, has been in custody for five years since his capture by the [[Red Army]] during the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]]. In the recently established [[China|People's Republic of China]], Puyi arrives as a [[political prisoner]] and [[War crime|war criminal]] at the [[Fushun War Criminals Management Centre|Fushun Prison]]. Soon after his arrival, Puyi attempts suicide, but is quickly rescued and told he must stand trial.

42 years earlier, in 1908, a toddler Puyi is summoned to the [[Forbidden City]] by the dying [[Empress Dowager Cixi]]. After telling him that the [[Guangxu Emperor|previous emperor]] had died earlier that day, Cixi tells Puyi that he is to be the next emperor. After his coronation, Puyi, frightened by his new surroundings, repeatedly expresses his wish to go home, but is denied. Despite having scores of palace [[eunuch]]s and maids to wait on him, his only real friend is his [[wet nurse]], [[Wang Lianshou|Ar Mo]].

As he grows up, his upbringing is confined entirely to the imperial palace and he is prohibited from leaving. One day, he is visited by his younger brother, [[Pujie]], who tells him he is no longer Emperor and that China has become a [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|republic]]; that same day, Ar Mo is forced to leave. In 1919, [[Reginald Johnston]] is appointed as Puyi's tutor and gives him a [[Education|Western-style education]], and Puyi becomes increasingly desirous to leave the Forbidden City. Johnston, wary of the [[courtier]]s' expensive lifestyle, convinces Puyi that the best way of achieving this is through marriage; Puyi subsequently weds [[Wanrong]], with [[Wenxiu]] as a secondary consort.

Puyi then sets about reforming the Forbidden City, including expelling the palace eunuchs. However, in 1924, he himself is expelled from the palace and exiled to [[Tianjin|Tientsin]] following the [[Beijing Coup]]. He leads a decadent life as a [[Playboy lifestyle|playboy]] and [[Anglophile]], and sides with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] after the [[Mukden Incident]]. During this time, Wenxiu divorces him, but Wanrong remains and eventually succumbs to [[Opium|opium addiction]]. In 1934, the Japanese crown him ""Emperor"" of their [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]], though his supposed political supremacy is undermined at every turn. Wanrong gives birth to an illegitimate child, but the baby is [[Neonaticide|murdered at birth]] by the Japanese and proclaimed [[Stillbirth|stillborn]]. She is then taken to a clinic where her physical and mental state declines even further. Puyi remains the nominal ruler of the region until Japan's capitulation. He decides to surrender to the Americans but before he can leave, he is captured by the Soviet [[Red Army]] and handed over to the Chinese.

Under the Communist re-education program for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced [[Collaboration with Imperial Japan|collaboration]] with the Japanese invaders during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. After heated discussions with Jin Yuan, the warden of the Fushun Prison, and watching a film detailing the [[Japanese war crimes|wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese]], Puyi eventually recants and is considered rehabilitated by the government; he is subsequently released in 1959.

Several years later in 1967, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant [[Proletariat|proletarian]] existence following the rise of [[Mao Zedong's cult of personality]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]]. On his way home from work, he happens upon a [[Red Guards|Red Guard]] parade, celebrating the rejection of [[Concentration of land ownership|landlordism]] by the communists. He sees Jin Yuan, now one of the political prisoners punished as an anti-revolutionary in the parade, forced to wear a [[dunce cap]] and a [[sandwich board]] bearing punitive slogans.

Puyi later visits the Forbidden City, now turned into a museum, where he meets an assertive young boy wearing the red scarf of the [[Young Pioneers of China|Pioneer Movement]]. The boy orders Puyi to step away from the throne, but Puyi proves that he was indeed the [[Son of Heaven]] before approaching the throne. Behind it, Puyi finds a 60-year-old pet [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] that he was given by palace official [[Chen Baochen]] on his coronation day and gives it to the child. Amazed by the gift, the boy turns to talk to Puyi, but finds that he has disappeared.

In 1987, a tour guide leads a group through the palace. Stopping in front of the throne, the guide sums up Puyi's life in a few, brief sentences, before concluding that he died in 1967.","Biography, Drama, History","starring       = {{Plainlist|

836,The Purple Rose of Cairo,"==Plot==
In 1935 with the [[Great Depression]] in full swing, [[New Jersey]] waitress Cecilia struggles with her stressful job and abusive marriage to her unfaithful husband Monk, whom she struggles to leave. After losing her job, she distracts herself by going to the movies, where she finds herself rewatching ''The Purple Rose of Cairo'' with a particular focus on archaeologist side character Tom Baxter, who falls in love with a [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] singer in the film's story.

Baxter notices Cecilia watching him and develops an attraction to the point where he addresses her directly and steps out of the film to run off with her, to the chagrin of the other, also sentient characters of the film. While Cecilia and Baxter grow closer as they spend an evening on the town together, the film's characters refuse to perform with him gone. The theater manager calls the film's producer and Baxter's actor Gil Shepherd is informed, who comes to town to fix the problem.

Shepherd runs into Cecilia and has her take him to Baxter, who refuses to return to the film as other versions of him across different screenings also start to rebel. Monk hears about Cecilia and Baxter's exploits and confronts them. Baxter beats him in a fair fight, so Monk hits him from behind, and a disgusted Cecilia refuses to leave with him. Baxter is accosted by a prostitute and taken to a [[brothel]], but he remains faithful to Cecilia. Shepherd charms and kisses Cecilia, but she turns him down in favor of Baxter.

While ''Purple Rose'' producers plan to destroy its copies once they get Baxter back inside, he and Cecilia get engaged as he returns to the theater and takes her into the film. Inside, he defies his pre-written romance and shows Cecilia the film's world, only for Shepherd to arrive at the theater and profess his love for her. The men argue over her and she chooses Shepherd, loving Baxter but preferring to live in the real world.

Baxter reluctantly returns to the film, while Cecilia finally leaves Monk for good, believing she and Shepherd will run away to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] together. He has already left, his seduction a ploy to get Baxter back into the film, though he appears guilty on the return flight. She sits forlornly in the theater watching ''[[Top Hat]]'', but the sight of [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Fred Astaire]] dancing to ""[[Cheek to Cheek]]"" captures her attention and she begins to smile.","Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","starring = {{Plainlist|

838,Zelig,"== Plot ==
Set in the 1920s and 1930s, the film concerns Leonard Zelig ([[Woody Allen]]), a nondescript man who has the ability to transform his behavior and demeanor to that of the people who surround him. He is first observed at a party by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], who notes that Zelig related to the affluent guests in a refined Boston accent and shared their Republican sympathies, but while in the kitchen with the servants, he adopted a coarser tone and seemed to be more of a Democrat. He soon gains international fame as a ""human [[chameleon]]"".

Interviewed in one of the witness shots, psychologist [[Bruno Bettelheim]] makes the following comment:<ref>{{cite book |first1=Glen O. |last1=Gabbard |author-link1=Glen Gabbard |first2=Krin |last2=Gabbard |title=Psychiatry and the Cinema |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D42m3IIrEDoC |year=1999 |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Publishing]] |location=[[Arlington County, Virginia]] |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=D42m3IIrEDoC&dq=%22Bruno+Bettelheim%22%22The+question+of+whether+Zelig+was+a+psychotic+or+merely+neurotic+was+a+question+that+was+endlessly+discussed+among+his+doctors.+Now+I%22&pg=PA264 264]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=D42m3IIrEDoC&dq=%22myself+felt+his+feelings+were+really+not+all+that+different+from+the+normal%2C+what+one+would+call+the+well-adjusted%2C+normal+person%2C+only+carried+to+an+extreme+degree%2C+to+an+extreme+extent.+I+myself+felt+that+one+could+really+think+of+him+as+the+ultimate+conformist%22&pg=PA265 265] |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-880-48964-5 |access-date=October 20, 2016 |archive-date=January 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119113449/https://books.google.com/books?id=D42m3IIrEDoC |url-status=live }}</ref>

Dr. Eudora Fletcher ([[Mia Farrow]]) is a [[psychiatrist]] who wants to help Zelig with this strange disorder when he is admitted to her hospital.<ref>Eudora Fletcher was the name of the principal of P.S. 99 in Brooklyn, NY, the elementary school Allen attended as a child.</ref> Through the use of [[hypnotism]], she discovers Zelig yearns for approval so strongly that he physically changes to fit in with those around him. Dr. Fletcher eventually cures Zelig of his compulsion to assimilate, but goes too far in the other direction; for a brief period he is so intolerant of others' opinions that he gets into a brawl over whether or not it is a nice day.

Dr. Fletcher realizes that she is falling in love with Zelig. Because of the media coverage of the case, both patient and doctor become part of the popular culture of their time. However, fame is the main cause of their division. Numerous women claim that he married and impregnated them, causing a public scandal. The same society that made Zelig a hero destroys him.

Zelig's illness returns, and he tries to fit in once more, before he disappears. Dr. Fletcher finds him in [[Germany]] working with the [[Nazism|Nazis]] before the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Together they escape, as Zelig uses his ability to imitate one more time, mimicking Fletcher's piloting skills and flying them back home across the Atlantic upside down.

839,The Verdict,"==Plot==
<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots are 400 to 700 words ONLY-->
Attorney Frank Galvin is an alcoholic [[ambulance chaser]]. As a favor, former partner Mickey Morrissey sends him a [[medical malpractice]] case which is all but certain to be settled for a significant amount. The case involves a young woman given general [[anesthesia]] during childbirth at a Catholic hospital, after which she choked on her vomit and was left [[coma]]tose. The [[plaintiff]]s, her sister and brother-in-law, intend to use the settlement to pay for her care. 

A representative of the Catholic diocese offers a $210,000 settlement (about $675,000 in 2024). Galvin declines and states his intention to go to trial. While preparing, he encounters Laura Fischer in a bar, and they become romantically involved.

Galvin experiences several setbacks. The hospital's attorney, Ed Concannon, has a large legal team that is masterful with the press. The comatose woman's brother-in-law angrily confronts Galvin after Concannon's team tells him of the settlement offer that Galvin rejected. Galvin's [[expert witness|medical expert]] disappears before testifying and a  substitute's credentials are challenged. Nobody who was in the operating room is willing to testify that negligence occurred.

In chambers during the trial, Judge Hoyle threatens Galvin with [[disbarment]], but Galvin dismisses him as a [[bagman]] for the local political machine. Hoyle denies Galvin's motion for a [[mistrial]] and threatens to have him arrested.

Galvin notices that the admitting nurse, Kaitlin Costello, filled out a form that included the question, ""When did you last eat?"" Galvin and Morrissey discover she is now a pre-school teacher in New York City. Galvin travels there to seek her help. As Laura arranges to meet him, Morrissey discovers a check in her handbag and realizes that Concannon is paying her for inside information. Morrissey informs Galvin of Laura's betrayal. Galvin confronts her in a bar and strikes her. On the flight back to Boston, Morrissey suggests moving for a mistrial due to Concannon's ethics violation, but Galvin decides to continue.

In the courtroom, Costello testifies that she wrote that the patient ate a full meal one hour before being admitted, contradicting the patient record, which states a nine-hour interval. Her superiors threatened her with termination unless she changed the original record from ""1"" to ""9,"" but before doing so, she made a photocopy, which she brought to court. Concannon objects that for legal purposes, the original is presumed to be correct, but Hoyle unexpectedly reserves judgment. Costello testifies that the [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiologist]] later confessed that he had failed to read her admitting notes and administered general anesthesia. As a result, the patient vomited and choked. When the anesthesiologist realized his error, he threatened to end Costello's career if she did not change the admitting form.

Concannon again objects on the grounds that the hospital's original admitting record has precedence. Hoyle agrees and declares Costello's testimony [[Motion to strike (court of law)|stricken from the record].

Despite believing his case is hopeless, Galvin gives a passionate [[closing argument]]. The jury finds in favor of the plaintiffs, and the foreman asks whether the jury can award more than what was asked for.

That night, a drunk Laura dials Galvin's office number. He moves to answer the call but changes his mind and lets the phone continue to ring.",Drama,"starring       = {{plainlist|

840,Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,"==Plot==
In 2285, Admiral [[James T. Kirk]] oversees a simulator session of Captain [[Spock]]'s trainees. In the simulation, Lieutenant [[Saavik]] commands the [[starship]] {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701|6}} on a rescue mission to save the crew of the damaged ship ''[[Kobayashi Maru]]'', but is attacked by [[Klingon]] cruisers and critically damaged. The simulation is a [[No-win situation|no-win scenario]] designed to test the character of [[Starfleet]] officers. Later, [[Dr. Leonard McCoy]] visits Kirk on his birthday; seeing Kirk in low spirits due to his age, the doctor advises Kirk to get a new command instead of growing old behind a desk.

{{anchor|Genesis Device}}Meanwhile, the starship ''Reliant'' is on a mission to search for a lifeless planet to test the Genesis Device, a technology designed to reorganize dead matter into [[terraforming|habitable worlds]]. ''Reliant'''s Captain [[List of Star Trek characters (T–Z)#T|Clark Terrell]] and first officer Commander [[Pavel Chekov]] [[Transporter (Star Trek)|beam down]] to evaluate a planet they mistakenly believe to be Ceti Alpha VI. Once there, they are captured by the genetically-engineered tyrant [[Khan Noonien Singh]], who explains that they are on Ceti Alpha V. Fifteen years prior, Kirk exiled Khan and his followers there after they [[Space Seed|attempted to take over ''Enterprise'']];<ref>{{cite web | url=https://trekmovie.com/2023/11/25/nicolas-meyer-gives-update-on-star-trek-khan-ceti-alpha-v-and-why-making-it-an-audio-drama-is-perfect/ | title=Nicholas Meyer Gives Update on 'Star Trek: Khan – Ceti Alpha V' and Why Making It an Audio Drama is ""Perfect"" }}</ref> six months later, Ceti Alpha VI exploded, shifting the orbit of Ceti Alpha V and turning it into a desert wasteland. This killed several of Khan's people; many others, including his wife, were killed by the native parasitic Ceti eels.

Khan implants Chekov and Terrell with eel larvae, rendering them susceptible to mind control; he uses the pair to capture ''Reliant''. Learning of the Genesis Device, Khan attacks space station ''Regula I'', where the device is being developed by Kirk's former lover, Dr. [[List of Star Trek characters (G–M)#M|Carol Marcus]], and their son, [[List of Star Trek characters (G–M)#M|David]].

Kirk assumes command of ''Enterprise'' after the ship, deployed on a training cruise, receives a distress call from ''Regula I''. En route, ''Enterprise'' is ambushed and crippled by ''Reliant''. Khan offers to spare Kirk's crew if they relinquish all material related to Genesis; Kirk instead stalls for time and, taking advantage of Khan's unfamiliarity with starship controls, remotely lowers ''Reliant''{{'}}s [[Shields (Star Trek)|shields]], enabling a counter-attack. Khan is forced to retreat and effect repairs, while ''Enterprise'' limps to ''Regula I''. Kirk, McCoy, and Saavik beam to the station and find Terrell and Chekov alive, along with the slaughtered members of Marcus' team. They soon find Carol and David hiding Genesis deep inside the nearby planetoid. Khan, having used Terrell and Chekov as spies, orders them to kill Kirk; Terrell resists the eel's influence and kills himself, while Chekov collapses as the eel leaves his body. Khan transports Genesis aboard the ''Reliant'', intending to maroon Kirk on the lifeless planetoid, but is tricked by Kirk and Spock's coded arrangements for a rendezvous. Kirk directs ''Enterprise'' into the nearby Mutara Nebula, successfully taunting Khan into following him; conditions inside the nebula render shields useless and compromise targeting systems, making ''Enterprise'' and ''Reliant'' evenly matched. Spock notes that Khan's tactics indicate inexperience in three-dimensional combat, which Kirk exploits to disable ''Reliant''.

Mortally wounded, Khan activates Genesis, quoting Captain Ahab from the novel [[Moby Dick]] as he dies. Though Kirk's crew detects the activation and attempts to move out of range, they will not be able to escape the nebula in time without the ship's inoperable [[warp drive]]. To restore warp power, Spock goes to the engine room, which is flooded with radiation. When McCoy tries to prevent Spock's entry, Spock incapacitates him with a [[Vulcan nerve pinch]] and performs a [[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Mind melds|mind meld]], telling him to ""remember"". Spock repairs the warp drive, and ''Enterprise'' jumps to warp, escaping the explosion, which forms a new planet. Before dying of [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation poisoning]], Spock urges Kirk not to grieve, as his decision to sacrifice himself to save the ''Enterprise'' was a logical one. Kirk and the ship's crew host a [[space burial]] for Spock, whose photon torpedo casket lands on the new Genesis planet.<ref name=""st-plot"">{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/MOV/002/synopsis/82.html|title='Wrath of Khan' Plot summary|website= StarTrek.com |publisher=Viacom|access-date=September 14, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314120301/http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/MOV/002/synopsis/82.html|archive-date=March 14, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=""roth"">{{cite journal | title=Death and Rebirth in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan | author=Roth, Lane | journal=Extrapolation |date=June 1987 | volume=28 | issue=2 | pages=159–66| doi=10.3828/extr.1987.28.2.159 }}</ref><ref name=""Adaptation"">{{cite book | title=Adaptations: From Text to Screen, Screen to Text | publisher=Routledge |author1=Cartmell, Deborah |author2=Whelehan, Imelda | author-link=Routledge | year=1999 | location=New York | pages=179–181 | isbn=0-415-16738-8}}</ref>","Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","starring       = {{Plainlist|

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->
[[John Rambo]], a [[Vietnam War]] veteran, goes to a lakehouse looking for his old comrade Delmar Barry only to learn that Barry died due to cancer a year ago, brought on by exposure to [[Agent Orange]] during the war. Rambo offers his condolences to Barry's widow for her loss and gives her a photo of the pair and the rest of their unit called ''Baker Team''. Rambo continues his travels, where he reaches the town of Hope, [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. 

Will Teasle, the town's sheriff,  drives him to the outskirts of town and explains that he considers it as his job to keep [[Vagrancy|drifters]] out of Hope. Neglecting Teasle's warning, Rambo returns to Hope, which prompts Teasle to arrest Rambo on charges of vagrancy, [[resisting arrest]] and [[Criminal possession of a weapon|possession of a concealed knife]]. While being processed at the police station, Rambo continues to be defiant and Teasle's deputies, led by the sadistic chief deputy Art Galt, [[Police brutality|abuses him]], triggering flashbacks of the torture which Rambo endured in [[Vietnam]]. 

When they attempt to [[dry shave]] him with a straight razor, Rambo finally fights his way out of the sheriff's station, regains his knife and flees on a motorcycle into the woods. Teasle organizes a search party with rifles, dogs and a helicopter. Galt blatantly disregards Teasle’s orders and proper procedure and attempts to shoot Rambo dead from the helicopter with a sniper rifle. Cornered on a high cliff, Rambo leaps into a tree, injuring his right arm. With Galt still shooting at him, Rambo throws a rock at the helicopter, cracking its windshield and causing the pilot to briefly lose control. Losing his balance, Galt falls to his death on the jagged rocks in a gorge below. Rambo tries to surrender to Teasle, reasoning that Galt's death was an accident and that he wants no more trouble, but the deputies shoot at him and Rambo flees. Other deputies warn Teasle that Rambo is a [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] warrior and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient, but Teasle swears revenge and continues the search.

Using guerilla tactics, Rambo non-lethally subdues all the deputies. With the deputies incapacitated, Rambo corners Teasle, holds a knife to his throat and threatens ""a war [Teasle] won't believe"" if he does not give up the pursuit, before retreating further into the woods. The [[Washington State Patrol]] and [[Washington National Guard]] are dispatched to assist Teasle, along with Rambo's mentor and former commanding officer [[Colonel|Col.]] [[Sam Trautman]]. Trautman advises that Rambo should be allowed to escape to [[Seattle]] to defuse the situation and be permitted to surrender peacefully, but Teasle, confident that Rambo is hopelessly outnumbered, refuses to go with Trautman’s plan. Teasle allows Trautman to contact Rambo to persuade him to surrender, but Rambo refuses, condemning Teasle and his deputies for their abuse and citing that they “drew first blood”.

At the entrance of an abandoned mine, a National Guard detachment corners Rambo. Ignoring Teasle's instructions to wait for his arrival, the guardsmen fire a rocket launcher, collapsing the mine entrance and seemingly killing Rambo. Teasle furiously berates the guardsman for disobeying his orders and demands that their leader Clinton Morgan dig out Rambo’s body. However, Rambo survives the attack, where he escapes the mine through a ventilation shaft, hijacks a military truck carrying an [[M60 machine gun]] and ammunition and returns to Hope to cause as much damage as possible in revenge. 

In an effort to distract the authorities, Rambo blows up a gas station, cuts power to most of the town, destroys a sporting goods store and shoots the sheriff's station. Trautman, understanding that Teasle is outmatched, again tries to convince Teasle to leave Rambo. Teasle, seeing Rambo's rampage as a personal attack, ignores Trautman's orders again and tries to hunt for Rambo on the station's roof, but Rambo manages to shoot and injure Teasle in a gunfire. 

When Rambo prepares to kill Teasle, Trautman appears and warns Rambo that he will be killed unless he surrenders, reminding him that he is the last survivor of ''Baker Team''. Rambo vents about the horrors of war and his [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|traumatic experiences]] like watching his friends give their lives in Vietnam, being treated poorly when returning home, being unable to hold a job and being forgotten despite his sacrifices. Rambo breaks down crying as he recounts how a good friend was killed by a [[Viet Cong]] [[child soldier]] using a [[shoeshiner]] box wired with explosives. After being comforted by a visibly disturbed Trautman, Rambo surrenders and is taken into federal custody, while Teasle is taken to a waiting ambulance for transport to the hospital.","Action, Adventure","starring       = {{Plainlist|

The Jarretts are an upper-middle-class family in [[Lake Forest, Illinois|Lake Forest]], a wealthy suburb north of [[Chicago]]. They are trying to return to normal life after experiencing the accidental death of their older teenage son, Buck, and the attempted suicide of their younger and surviving son, Conrad. Conrad has recently returned home after spending four months in a [[psychiatric hospital]]. He feels alienated from his friends and family and seeks help from a psychiatrist, Dr. Tyrone Berger, who discovers that Conrad was involved in the sailing accident that caused Buck's death. Conrad is now dealing with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] and is seeking help to cope with his emotions.

Conrad's father, Calvin, attempts to connect with his surviving son and understand his wife, while Conrad's mother, Beth, denies her loss, hoping to maintain her composure and restore her family to what it once was. She appears to have favored her older son and has grown cold toward Conrad due to his suicide attempt. Beth is determined to maintain the appearance of perfection and normality, and her efforts only serve to alienate Conrad further. Conrad works with Dr. Berger and begins to learn how to deal with his emotions rather than control them. He starts dating a fellow student, Jeannine, who helps him regain a sense of optimism. However, Conrad still struggles to communicate and establish normal relationships with his parents and schoolmates.

Beth and Conrad often argue while Calvin tries to referee, generally taking Conrad's side for fear of pushing him over the edge again. Tensions escalate near Christmas when Conrad becomes furious at Beth for not wanting to take a photo with him, swearing at her in front of his grandparents. Afterwards, Beth discovers Conrad has been lying about his after-school whereabouts. This leads to a heated confrontation between Conrad and Beth in which Conrad points out that Beth never visited him in the hospital; Conrad argues that if Buck had been hospitalized in his place, she would have gone to see him, to which Beth curtly replies that Buck would never have been in the hospital in the first place. Beth and Calvin take a trip to see Beth's brother Ward in Houston, where Calvin presses Beth about her evasive attitude.

Conrad suffers a setback when he learns that Karen, a friend from the psychiatric hospital, has committed suicide. A cathartic breakthrough session in the middle of the night with Dr. Berger allows Conrad to stop blaming himself for Buck's death and accept his mother's frailties. However, when Conrad tries to show affection, Beth is unresponsive, leading Calvin to emotionally confront her one last time. He questions their love and asks whether she is capable of truly loving anyone. Stunned, Beth packs her bags and goes back to Houston. Calvin and Conrad are left to come to terms with their new family situation, affirming their father-son love.",Drama,"starring       = [[Donald Sutherland]]<br>[[Mary Tyler Moore]]<br>[[Judd Hirsch]]<br>[[Timothy Hutton]]

Ex-[[fighter pilot]] Ted Striker is a [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|traumatized]] war veteran turned taxi driver. Because of his pathological [[fear of flying]] and subsequent ""drinking problem""—he splashes beverages anywhere but into his mouth—Ted has been unable to hold a responsible job. His wartime girlfriend, Elaine Dickinson, now a [[flight attendant]], breaks off her relationship with him before boarding her rostered flight from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Chicago]]. Ted abandons his taxi and buys a ticket on the same flight to try to win her back. Once on board, however, Elaine continues to reject him, causing Ted to accidentally drive several other passengers to suicide as he sadly reminisces.

After the in-flight meal is served, the entire flight crew and several passengers fall ill. Passenger Dr. Rumack discovers that the fish served during meal service has caused [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]]. With the flight crew incapacitated, Elaine contacts the Chicago [[control tower]] for help and is instructed by tower supervisor Steve McCroskey to activate the plane's [[autopilot]], a large inflatable dummy pilot dubbed ""Otto"", which will get them to Chicago but cannot land the plane. Elaine and Rumack convince Ted to take the controls. When Steve learns Ted is piloting, he contacts Ted's former commanding officer, Rex Kramer—now serving as a commercial pilot—to help talk Ted through the landing procedure. Ted becomes uneasy when Kramer starts giving orders and he briefly breaks down amid more wartime flashbacks. Elaine and Rumack both bolster Ted's confidence and he manages to once again take the controls.

As the plane nears Chicago, the weather worsens, complicating the landing. With Elaine's help as co-pilot and Rex's guidance from the tower, Ted is able to land the plane safely, despite the landing gear shearing off, and the passengers suffer only minor injuries. Rescue vehicles arrive to help unload the plane. Impressed by Ted's courage, Elaine embraces and kisses him, rekindling their relationship. ""Otto"" restarts the plane and takes off as a female companion inflates beside him.",Comedy,"starring       = {{Plainlist|

847,Love and Death,"==Plot==
About to be executed for a crime he never committed, Boris Grushenko recalls how he got into his present predicament. Initially scheduled to die at 5:00 am, Boris receives leniency—a delay in execution until 6:00 am.

Ivan, Mikhail, and Boris are three brothers grown to “full manhood,” with Ivan and Mikhail brawny and athletic, and Boris a scrawny 5'6"". Since childhood, Boris has been in love with his cousin Sonja, with whom he has deep conversations. Sonja: ""To love is to suffer. To avoid suffering one must not love, but then one suffers from not loving. Therefore, to love is to suffer, not to love is to suffer, to suffer is to suffer. To be happy is to love, to be happy then is to suffer but suffering makes one unhappy; therefore, to be unhappy one must love or love to suffer or suffer from too much happiness. I hope you're getting this down.""

Sonja tells Boris that she yearns for a man who embodies her three essentials of love: intellectuality, spirituality, and sensuality. Thinking that she is confessing her love for him, Boris is devastated when Sonja says she has been in love with Ivan all her life. Boris: ""Ivan can barely write his name in the ground with a stick.""

When Ivan announces that he intends to marry Anna Ivanova, a desolate Sonja immediately announces that she will marry Sergei Minskov, 81. Excited, Minskov immediately dies from a heart attack. Sonja then marries Leonid Boskovic, the herring merchant, who amuses himself with herring while Sonya dallies with a musician.

When [[Napoleon]] [[War of the Fifth Coalition|invades Austria]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Boris, a coward and [[pacifist]], is forced to enlist in the Russian army. Boris doesn’t believe in fighting for “Mother Russia.” Boris’s Mother: ""I hope they put him in the front lines!""

Boris completes military training, including a “hygiene play” on condoms and venereal disease. On furlough, Boris flirts at the opera with the beautiful Countess Alexandrovna, whose current lover has killed several men in [[Duel|duels]]. Countess: ""You’re the greatest lover I ever had."" Boris: ""I practice a lot when I’m alone.""

Unhappy in her marriage, Sonja recounts a long list of lovers. Boris offers to take her away, but Sonja asks after Ivan. When Boris tells her he is going to the front the next day, Sonja bids Boris, “have a nice time!” Boris inadvertently becomes a war hero when he falls asleep inside a large cannon and is fired into the French command tent, killing the officers. The regiment that started with 1200 men in battle thins down to 14 survivors; a message from the [[Tsar|Czar]] encourages, “keep up the good work.” Ivan, a battle fatality, is bayonetted to death by a ""Polish [[conscientious objector]].""

A Turkish cavalry officer impugns Sonja’s chastity. Boskovic dies accidentally while cleaning his pistol in preparing for a duel to defend her honor. Sonja laments she wasn’t kinder to him—perhaps even having sex with him once.

The Countess’s lover, Anton Lebedokov, challenges Boris to a duel. Boris returns and proposes to the widowed Sonja, who promises to marry him, thinking he will be killed in the duel. To her surprise and dejection, Boris survives the duel. Their marriage is filled with philosophical debates. Sonja: ""Sex without love is an empty experience."" Boris: ""Yes, but as empty experiences go, it’s tough to beat."" As time passes, he wins Sonja’s heart.

Sonja conceives a plot to [[Assassination|assassinate]] Napoleon at his headquarters in Moscow. They debate the matter with philosophical [[doublespeak]], and Boris reluctantly agrees. At an inn enroute to Moscow they encounter [[Don (honorific)|Don]] Francisco and his sister, emissaries from [[Joseph Bonaparte]] to Napoleon. Boris and Sonya waylay the Spaniards, taking their place. Unknowingly, they meet with Napoleon’s double, who attempts to seduce Sonja but is knocked out by her after Boris fails various attempts. Over the unconscious body, Sonya and Boris debate the [[ethics]] of killing Napoleon. While Boris vacillates, another intended Napoleon assassin shoots the double.

Sonja escapes arrest, but Boris is captured. Despite being told by a vision that he will be pardoned, Boris is executed. Boris's ghost bids goodbye to Sonja and the audience before dancing away with [[Personifications of death|Death]].","Comedy, War","starring       = Woody Allen<br>[[Diane Keaton]]

849,Blazing Saddles,"== Plot ==
On the [[American frontier]] of 1874, a new railroad under construction will have to be rerouted through the town of Rock Ridge to avoid [[quicksand]]. Realizing this will make Rock Ridge worth millions, [[State attorney general|territorial attorney general]] Hedley Lamarr plans to force Rock Ridge's residents out of the town and sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky Taggart, to shoot the sheriff and trash the town.

The townspeople demand that Governor William J. [[Le Petomane]] appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart, a black railroad worker about to be executed for assaulting Taggart. A black sheriff, Lamarr reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos and leave Rock Ridge at his mercy.

After an initial hostile reception in which he takes himself ""hostage"" to escape, Bart relies on his quick wits and the assistance of Jim, an alcoholic [[gunslinger]] known as the ""[[Waco]] Kid"", to overcome the townspeople's hostility. Bart subdues Mongo, an immensely strong and dim-witted, yet philosophical henchman sent to kill him, then outwits German seductress-for-hire Lili Von Shtupp at her own game, with Lili falling in love with him.

Upon release, Mongo vaguely informs Bart of Lamarr's connection to the railroad, so Bart and Jim visit the railroad worksite and discover from Bart's best friend Charlie that the railway is planned to go through Rock Ridge. Taggart and his men arrive to kill Bart, but Jim outshoots them and forces their retreat. Furious that his schemes have backfired, Lamarr recruits an army of thugs, including common criminals, [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gangsters]], [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen, [[Nazism|Nazi]] soldiers, and [[Methodism|Methodists]].

East of Rock Ridge, Bart introduces the White townspeople to the black, Chinese, and Irish railroad workers who have all agreed to help them in exchange for acceptance by the community, and explains his plan to defeat Lamarr's army. They labor all night to build a perfect copy of the town as a diversion. When Bart realizes it will not be enough to fool the villains, the townsfolk construct copies of themselves.

Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the ""Gov. William J. Le Petomane [[Controlled-access highway|Thruway]]"", forcing the raiding party to send for change to pay the toll. Once through the [[tollbooth]], the raiders attack the fake town and its population of dummies, which have been [[booby trap]]ped with dynamite. After Jim detonates the bombs with his sharpshooting, launching bad guys and horses skyward, the Rock Ridgers attack the villains with Lili singing with the Nazi soldiers.

The resulting brawl between townsfolk, railroad workers, and Lamarr's thugs literally breaks the [[fourth wall]] and bursts onto a neighboring movie set where director Buddy Bizarre is filming a [[Busby Berkeley]]-style top-hat-and-tails musical number. Then the brawl spreads into the studio commissary for a food fight and spills out of the [[Warner Bros. Studios Burbank|Warner Bros. film lot]] onto the streets of [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].

Lamarr escapes the brawl and takes a taxi to hide at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre|Mann's Chinese Theatre]] which is showing the premiere of ''Blazing Saddles''. As he settles into his seat, he sees onscreen Bart arriving on horseback outside the theatre. Bart blocks Lamarr's escape and shoots him in the groin. Bart and Jim then enter the theater to watch the end of the film.

Back in the film, Bart announces to the townspeople that he is moving on because his work is done (and because he is bored). Riding out of town, he finds Jim, still eating his popcorn, and invites him along to ""nowhere special"". The two friends briefly ride into the desert before dismounting and boarding a limousine which drives off into the sunset.","Comedy, Western","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--Per poster billing-->

850,Serpico,"== Plot ==
[[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] Officer [[Frank Serpico]] is rushed to the hospital, having been shot in the face. Chief Sidney Green fears that Serpico was shot by another cop. So Serpico's story is shown in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]].

Serpico graduates from the police academy with big ideas for improving the police force's community relations. He dresses like an actual civilian instead of wearing the department's standard plainclothes dress, which is easily recognizable. While he is chasing a burglar, other officers fail to recognize him as one of their own and shoot at him. He realizes that deviating from protocols can be dangerous.

Serpico reports an attempted bribe to a high-ranking investigator, who chuckles and advises him to keep the money. Serpico soon learns that corruption is rampant in his police department. Forced to accompany officers as they collect payoffs from criminals and small businesses, Serpico refuses to accept his share of the money. He makes several attempts to alert superiors to the corruption but is rebuffed every time. Other officers learn that he is reporting them, and he begins to fear for his life.

Serpico and his well-connected friend Blair go to the mayor's assistant, who promises a real investigation and support but is stymied by political pressure. Ostracized, frustrated and fearful, Serpico sinks into depression, which ruins his relationship with his girlfriend. He begins brutalizing well-connected suspects who had been bribing other officers and thought themselves protected. Finally, Serpico informs Captain McClain that he has reported his experiences to oversight agencies outside the police force. Furious, McClain tells the other officers.

Blair uses his connections to arrange a personal interview with the [[district attorney]], who tells Serpico that if he testifies to a grand jury, a major investigation will follow. The DA limits his questions and prevents Serpico from revealing the ubiquity of corruption in the police force. Serpico and Blair take their story to ''[[The New York Times]]''. After his allegations are printed, his superiors retaliate by assigning him to a dangerous narcotics squad in [[Brooklyn]].

During a raid on a drug trafficker's apartment, Serpico's partners hold back at a critical moment, and Serpico gets shot in the face. After a long, painful recovery, he testifies before the [[Knapp Commission]], a government inquiry into NYPD corruption.

Frank Serpico resigned from the NYPD on June 15, 1972, was awarded the [[New York City Police Department Medal of Honor|NYPD Medal of Honor]] for ""conspicuous bravery in action"", and moved to Switzerland.","Biography, Crime, Drama","starring       = [[Al Pacino]]<!-- Per poster -->

851,Enter the Dragon,"==Plot==
Lee, a martial artist and instructor from Shaolin temple, [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], is approached by [[British intelligence agencies|British intelligence agent]] Braithwaite and asks for his help in an [[covert operation|undercover mission]], investigating a suspected crime lord Han, who was one of the students in Shaolin temple. Lee is persuaded to attend a high-profile martial arts tournament in Han's private island to gather evidence that will prove Han's involvement and suspicions to in [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] and [[prostitution]].

Since Han's island is only partly in their jurisdiction, they are unable to conduct any formal investigations. Han doesn't allow firearms on the island to prevent assassination attempts and also prevent the international authorities from launching a raid. Han runs a martial arts school to protect his illegal operations and holds the tournament to recruit martial artists to expand his illegal business. Lee agrees to help Braithwaite, believing his efforts will also redeem the honor of the Shaolin temple that was tarnished by Han. Shortly before his departure, Lee also learns that Han's bodyguard O'Hara is responsible for the death of his sister Su Lin.

Lee arrives on Han's island and receives a warm reception. Joining him are other competitors, including Roper, an American playboy and [[gambling|gambler]], who is indebted and on the run from the mob, and Williams, an African-American activist, who is on the run after defending himself against two racist cops in [[Los Angeles|LA]]. Roper and Williams are former [[Karate]] brothers and fellow [[Vietnam War]] veterans, who also have a betting scam going: one will underperform until the other can get a bet on the outcome at good odds. Roper and Williams win their first fights easily.

The rules of Han's tournament are simple: Competitors compete in one-on-one matches against each other, the opponent, who gets knocked to the ground loses each round. Any weapons are strictly prohibited in the fighting arena. At the end of the first day, the competitors are all offered girls of their choice by Han's assistant Tania. Williams chooses several women, while Roper cunningly chooses Tania as a mutual attraction grows between them. Lee chooses a girl, which he saw in Han's entourage, who is Mei Ling, a [[Covert operation|covert agent]] whom Braithwaite had placed on the island to gather intelligence. However, Mei Ling has been unable to escape Han's strict observation to never leave their rooms.

That night, Lee begins to stealthily search and infiltrate the island for evidence and finds a secret entrance to an underground compound base, where drugs are being manufactured and tested on unwitting prisoners. Lee runs into Han's guards, but manages to take them down and flee before they can identify him. Lee is seen by Williams, who is outside for some fresh air and practice, despite strict rules against being outside after night. The next morning, Han warns the competitors about wandering out of their rooms at night. Han punishes his guards for their inability to fulfill their duties by leaving them to be killed by Bolo, Han's giant enforcer and chief bodyguard. After the execution, the competition resumes as Lee is called to his first match and his opponent turns out to be O'Hara.

During the fight, Han warns O'Hara to step down as Lee keeps outclassing him in a humiliating fashion. Lee kills O'Hara after he tries to attack him with a pair of half-shattered glass bottles, thus avenging Su Lin's death. An embarrassed Han abruptly ends the day's competition after stating that O'Hara's treachery has disgraced them. Later, Han summons Williams in his office and accuses him of attacking the guards the previous night. Williams denies this and decides to leave the island. Han brutally beats Williams to death with his iron [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] left hand.

Han takes Roper on a tour of his underground base and invites him to be his representative for his illegal operations in [[United States|US]]. Han also implicitly threatens to imprison Roper with other martial artists, who joined Han's tournaments in the past, if Roper does not join his operation. Roper reluctantly accepts after Han throws the mutilated corpse of Williams over a pit of acid, hinting that Roper will face the same fate if he refuses to cooperate with Han. The same night, Lee infiltrates the underground base again to gather sufficient evidence to warrant Han's arrest and manages to send a message to Braithwaite. After a prolonged battle with Han's guards, Lee is eventually lured into a door trap to get imprisoned and captured.

The next morning, Han commands Roper to fight Lee, but Roper refuses and Han has him fight Bolo. Roper manages to overpower and beat Bolo after a gruelling battle. Han orders all his men to kill Lee and Roper. Despite facing insurmountable odds, the island's prisoners, released by Mei Ling, and the other invited martial artists aid Lee and Roper in defeating Han's guards. Amidst the chaos, Han attempts to fight his way out to escape, only to have Lee pursuit and corner him to his museum, where Han retrieves a bladed-talon replacement for his hand to prepare for a brutal fight. Han retreats into a room full of mirrors, which proves disorientating for Lee until Lee keeps a strategy in mind and smashes all the mirrors to spoil Han's illusions to easily spot Han. Lee kicks Han, who gets impaled on his own spear that was halfway harpooned through a wall.

Lee returns to Roper and they exchange a weary [[Thumb signal|thumbs-up]] as the military finally arrives to take control of the island.","Action, Crime, Drama","starring       = {{Unbulleted list |[[Bruce Lee]]|[[John Saxon]]|[[Ahna Capri]]|[[Robert Wall|Bob Wall]]|[[Shih Kien]]|[[Jim Kelly (martial artist)|Jim Kelly]]}}

852,Deliverance,"==Plot==
Lewis Medlock, Ed Gentry, Bobby Trippe, and Drew Ballinger are [[Atlanta]] businessmen who decide to canoe down the [[Cahulawassee River]] in the remote [[Appalachia|northern Georgia wilderness]] before it is [[dam]]med. Lewis is an avid outdoorsman and [[survivalist]] who leads the group, and Ed has been on several trips but lacks Lewis's ego, while Bobby and Drew are novices. En route to their launch site, the men, in particular Bobby, are rude toward the locals, who are hostile to the ""city boys"". At a local gas station, Drew, with his guitar, engages a young banjo-playing boy in a musical duel. The duel is mutually enjoyable, and some of the locals break into dance at the sound of it. However, the boy does not acknowledge Drew when prompted for a friendly handshake.

The four friends travel in pairs and their two canoes become separated. Ed and Bobby encounter a pair of [[Mountain man|mountain men]] emerging from the woods, one carrying a shotgun and missing his two front teeth. Following an argument, Bobby is forced by the men to undress and the unarmed man rapes him, demanding he ""squeal like a pig"", while Ed is tied to a tree and held at gunpoint. Lewis sneaks up and kills the rapist with his [[bow and arrow]] while Ed snatches the shotgun from the other mountain man, who flees into the woods. After a heated debate between Lewis and Drew, Ed and Bobby vote to side with Lewis' plan to bury the body and continue on as if nothing had happened. The four continue downriver but the canoes reach a dangerous stretch of rapids. As Drew and Ed reach the rapids in the lead canoe, Drew falls into the water.

The canoes collide on the rocks, throwing the three remaining men into the river and smashing one of the canoes. Lewis breaks his thigh bone and the other two are washed ashore alongside him in a gorge. Lewis, who believes Drew fell out of the boat because he was shot, encourages Ed to climb to the top of the gorge and ambush the other mountain man, whom they believe to be stalking them from above. Ed reaches an overhang and hides out until morning, when a man appears above him and aims a rifle at him; a panicked Ed clumsily shoots and manages to kill the man, but falls backwards and lands on one of his own arrows. Ed worries that he has killed the wrong man when he inspects the body to find that the man has all of his teeth, but he then realizes the man is wearing dentures. Ed and Bobby weigh down the man's body in the river to ensure it will never be found, then do the same to Drew's body when they encounter it downriver shortly after.

Upon finally reaching the small town of Aintry, Ed and Bobby take Lewis to the hospital. The three carefully concoct a cover story for local authorities about Drew's death, lying about their adventure to Sheriff Bullard in order to escape a possible double murder charge. Their cover is almost blown when Ed thinks he has overheard Bobby secretly telling the sheriff the truth, but Bobby convinces him otherwise. Ed and Bobby visit Lewis in the hospital, where Lewis is being watched over by a police officer. A worried Ed whispers to Lewis that they need to change their cover story, but Lewis relaxes him by pretending that he has no memory of what happened after they fell off the canoes due to [[head trauma]]. Sheriff Bullard does not believe the men and reveals that Deputy Queen is suspicious of them because his brother-in-law went hunting a few days ago and has not returned. However, he has no evidence to arrest them, and instead tells them never to do ""this kind of thing again"" and to never come back to the area. The three men vow to keep their story of death and survival a secret for the rest of their lives.

Ed reunites with his wife and son. Some time after, a bloated hand rises from the lake, only to be revealed as a nightmare from the experience that torments Ed.","Adventure, Drama, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist|

854,Dirty Harry,"== Plot ==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words. Current word count is 668.--> 
A psychopathic sniper, later referred to as ""Scorpio"", shoots a woman while she swims in a San Francisco skyscraper rooftop pool. He leaves behind a threatening letter demanding he be paid $100,000 or he will kill more people. The note is found by [[SFPD]] [[Dirty Harry (character)|Inspector Harry Callahan]], who is investigating the killing. The [[Mayor of San Francisco|mayor]] teams up with the police to track down the killer; to stall for time, he agrees to Scorpio's demand over Callahan's objections. During his lunch break, Harry foils a bank robbery. He shoots one robber dead, and holds another at gunpoint with his [[Smith & Wesson Model 29]] revolver, giving him an [[ultimatum]]:

<blockquote>I know what you're thinking: 'Did he fire six shots or only five?'  Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being this is a [[.44 Magnum]], the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do you, punk? </blockquote>

Despite surrendering, the robber insists on knowing, and Harry jovially pulls the trigger, revealing the gun is empty.

Harry is assigned a rookie partner, Chico Gonzalez, against his opposition to working with yet another inexperienced police officer. Meanwhile, Scorpio is spotted by a police helicopter while staking for potential victims, but he escapes. After assisting in preventing a suicide, Harry and Gonzalez learn that Scorpio has murdered a 10-year-old African-American boy. Based on Scorpio's letter, the police think his next victim will be a Catholic priest, and set a trap for him.

Scorpio eventually arrives, kills a police officer in a shootout, and flees. The next day, the police receive another letter in which Scorpio claims to have kidnapped a teenager named Ann Mary Deacon. He threatens to kill her if he is not given a ransom of $200,000. Harry is assigned to deliver the money, wearing a radio earpiece so Gonzalez can secretly follow him. Scorpio instructs Harry via payphones around the city. They meet at the [[Mount Davidson (California)|Mount Davidson]] cross, where Scorpio beats Harry and admits he intends to kill him and let Ann Mary die. Gonzalez intervenes and gets shot in the chest. Harry manages to stab Scorpio in the leg, but he escapes.

Harry learns of Scorpio's hospital visit and a doctor reveals that the killer lives in a room at [[Kezar Stadium]]. Harry finds him there and chases him, shooting him in the leg. Harry tortures Scorpio into confessing where Ann Mary is being held, but the police find her dead. The district attorney reprimands Harry for his conduct, explaining that because Harry obtained his evidence against Scorpio illegally, all of it is inadmissible in court, and Scorpio is to be freed. An outraged Harry continues to shadow Scorpio on his own time. Scorpio pays a man $200 to beat him severely and frames Harry for it, forcing Harry to stop following him. Meanwhile, a hospitalized Gonzalez tells Harry of his intention to leave the SFPD and become a teacher instead.

Scorpio steals a pistol from a liquor store owner and hijacks a school bus. He contacts the police with another ransom demand that includes a flight out of the country. Harry waits for him, then jumps onto the roof of the bus from an overpass. Scorpio crashes the bus into a dirt mound and flees to a nearby quarry, where he takes a hostage before Harry wounds him. Harry aims his revolver and reprises his ultimatum about losing count of his shots. Scorpio reaches for his gun and Harry shoots. This time, the gun fires, killing Scorpio.

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->
In the winter of 1943-44, [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] officers Colonel Turner and Admiral Rolland assign Major John Smith, five other [[Commandos (United Kingdom)|commando]]s of the [[Special Operations Executive]], and [[U.S. Army Ranger]] Lieutenant Morris Schaffer of the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] to rescue [[U.S. Army]] [[Brigadier General]] George Carnaby, a chief planner for the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], captured by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] and held at the ''Schloß Adler'', a mountaintop fortress in the [[Bavaria]]n alpine village of Werfen, accessible only by [[aerial tramway|cable car]]. Disguised as German troops, Smith and his team are to parachute in, infiltrate the castle, and rescue Carnaby before the Germans can interrogate him. After a [[Ju 52]] transport plane drops the team, agent Mary Ellison is dropped separately in secret, her presence known only to Smith.

Though two commandos are mysteriously killed, Smith continues the operation; he keeps Schaffer as a close ally, and helps Mary meet local agent Heidi Schmidt, who arranges for Mary to be employed at the castle. Smith starts revealing to Mary that the mission is not what it initially seems - Carnaby's capture was deliberately staged by the British, and that Carnaby himself was replaced with an impersonator named Cartwright Jones.  In Werfen, the Germans eventually surround the commandos in a [[gasthaus]], forcing them to surrender. Smith and Schaffer (being officers) are separated from the remaining three operatives: Thomas, Berkeley, and Christiansen. Smith and Schaffer kill their captors, blow up a supply depot, and prepare an escape route for later use. They ride on the roof of a cable car up to the castle, and then climb inside when Mary lowers a rope.

German [[General (Germany)|General]] Rosemeyer and [[Standartenführer]] Kramer are interrogating Carnaby when the three new prisoners arrive, who reveal themselves as German [[double agent]]s. Smith and Schaffer intrude, weapons drawn, but Smith forces Schaffer to disarm, identifying himself as [[Sturmbannführer]] Johann Schmidt of the [[Schutzstaffel]]'s [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] intelligence branch. He conveys proof of his identity, which includes showing the name of Germany's top spy in Britain to Kramer, who silently affirms it. He exposes ""General Carnaby"" as Corporal Cartwright Jones, and claims that the double agents are British impostors, Smith proposes that they prove themselves by writing down the names of their fellow agents in Britain, to be compared to his own list in his pocket. After the three finish their lists, Smith takes them and then reveals that he was bluffing, and that the actual objective of the mission was to exploit the staged capture of Carnaby/Jones to penetrate the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] in order to obtain the identities of the German agents and their commander.

Meanwhile, Mary is visited by [[Sturmbannführer]] von Hapen, an SD officer attracted to her, but he becomes suspicious of flaws in her cover story. Leaving her, he happens upon the scene of Carnaby's interrogation just as Smith finishes his explanation. Von Hapen puts everyone under arrest but is distracted when Mary arrives. Schaffer kills von Hapen and the other German officers with his silenced pistol. The group then makes its escape, taking the three double agents as prisoners. Schaffer sets explosives to create diversions around the castle, while Smith uses the radio room to inform Rolland of their success. From there they head to the cable car station, sacrificing Thomas as a decoy. Berkeley and Christiansen break free and attempt their own escape in a cable car; both are thwarted and killed by Smith. The group reunites with Heidi on the ground, boarding a bus they prepared earlier as an escape vehicle. They battle their way onto an airfield and escape via their Ju 52 transport, where Turner is waiting.

In the air, Smith reveals that Kramer confirmed Turner as Germany's top spy in Britain. Rolland lured Turner and the other double agents into the mission to expose them. Smith's trusted partner Mary and the American Schaffer (who had no connection to MI6) were assigned to the mission to ensure its success. Turner aims a [[Sten gun]], but Rolland anticipated such a move and removed its [[firing pin]]. To avoid a humiliating court martial and execution, Turner is permitted to jump from the aircraft to his death. As the exhausted operatives fly home, Schaffer humorously tells Smith to keep his next operation ""all-British"".","Action, Adventure, War","starring       = {{Plain list |

857,The Dirty Dozen,"==Plot==
In March 1944, [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] officer Major John Reisman is ordered by the commander of [[ADSEC]] in Britain, Major General Sam Worden, to undertake ""Project Amnesty"", a top secret mission to turn some of the [[U.S. Army]]'s worst convicts into highly skilled commandos to eliminate [[Wehrmacht]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] at a [[château]] near [[Rennes]], disrupting the German chain of command in northern [[France]] ahead of [[D-Day]]. Any convicts who survive the mission will receive a [[pardon]].

Reisman meets the twelve convicts (including the mob-associated robber Franko, former [[Major (rank)|major]] Wladislaw, black soldier Jefferson, the gentle giant and [[hazed]] enduced Posey, and religiously driven psychopath Maggott) at a [[military prison]] operated by the [[Military Police Corps (United States)|Military Police Corps]]. These five are condemned to death for murder, while the others (Giplin, Pinkley, Sawyer, Lever, Bravos, Vladek, and Jiminez) face lengthy sentences, including [[hard labor]] for crimes such as assault, [[larceny]], [[Robbery|mugging]] and impersonation. Reisman quickly establishes his authority, but the group remains disgruntled. Overseen by MPs led by Sergeant Bowren, the convicts gradually learn to operate together when they are forced to build their own training camp. However, an act of [[insubordination]] by Franko results in the men's shaving and wash kits being withheld as punishment, leading the group to be nicknamed the ""Dirty Dozen.""<!-- Spoken to by Bowren as ""you Dirty Dozen"" in the film. As the plot specifies the nickname and not the film's title, 'the' is excluded from the quotation; see [[MOS:THETITLE]]. May 2023. --> During their training, the convicts are psychoanalyzed by Captain Kinder, who warns Reisman that there is a chance that at least 7 of them will likely kill him if given the chance and that Maggott is by far the most dangerous.

With their commando training almost complete, the Dirty Dozen are sent for parachute training at a facility commanded by Reisman's nemesis, Colonel Everett Dasher Breed of the [[101st Airborne Division]]. However, Breed is curiously not briefed about Project Amnesty. Rather than making inquiries to higher command, Breed makes several attempts to discover Reisman's mission, including infiltration of the Dirty Dozen's camp. Reisman, with the eager assistance of the convicts, angrily kicks Breed and his men out of the camp. Later, Breed's testimony combined with Reisman rewarding the Dirty Dozen (with the exception of Maggott, as his crime is the [[rape]] and murder of one) with prostitutes at the end of their training, prompts the ADSEC staff to consider terminating the project and sending the men back to serve their original sentences. Reisman defends the convicts' training and agrees to have them compete against Breed's men in [[military exercise|war games]] to test their mettle. Breed finds this ridiculously humorous, but to his surprise, the Dirty Dozen successfully capture his headquarters and Worden allows Reisman to resume his mission.

Upon parachuting into northern France, Jiminez breaks his neck during the jump. With a man down, the mission proceeds with the German-speaking Wladislaw and Reisman infiltrating the chateau disguised as German officers. However, all surprise is lost when Maggott breaks cover by murdering an officer's spouse before he is killed by Jefferson for compromising the mission. The sound of gunfire makes the Wehrmacht officers and their companions retreat to a locked underground [[bomb shelter]], but the unit pours gasoline through ventilation shafts and Jefferson throws grenades into the shelter through the shafts, killing the officers and their civilian guests.

After a firefight that kills nearly all the Dozen, Reisman, Bowren and Wladislaw escape back to England alive. Worden pardons Wladislaw, who is given the opportunity to resume his work in the armed forces. As the credits roll, Reisman communicates to the other convicts' next of kin that ""they lost their lives in the line of duty"".","Action, Adventure, War","starring       = {{Plainlist|

866,The Magnificent Seven,"==Plot==
A gang of bandits led by Calvera periodically raids a poor Mexican village for food and supplies. After the latest raid, during which Calvera kills a villager, the village leaders decide to fight back. They send three villagers carrying their few objects of value to try and barter for weapons.

In a town just inside the United States, the villagers find [[Chris Adams (character)|Chris]], a veteran [[Cajun]] [[gunslinger]], and approach him. Chris advises that they instead hire gunfighters to defend the village, as ""men are cheaper than guns."" At first agreeing only to help them recruit, Chris eventually leads the group.

Despite the meager pay, Chris finds five willing gunmen. They include Vin Tanner, a gunfighter gone broke from [[gambling]]; Chris' friend Harry Luck, who assumes Chris is hiding a much bigger reward for the work; the [[Irish Mexican]] Bernardo O'Reilly, who has fallen on hard times; Britt, an expert in both knife and gun who joins purely for the challenge involved; and the dapper, on-the-run gunman Lee, plagued by nightmares of fallen enemies and so haunted that he has lost his nerve for battle. On their way to the village, they are trailed by the hotheaded Chico, an aspiring gunfighter whose previous attempts to join Chris had been spurned. Impressed by his persistence, Chris allows him into the group.

Arriving at the village, they work with the villagers to build fortifications and train them in combat. They note the lack of young women in the village until Chico stumbles upon Petra and discovers the women were hidden in fear that the gunmen would rape them. The gunmen begin to bond with the villagers, and Petra pursues Chico. When Bernardo points out that the gunmen are being given the choice food, they share it with the village children.

Three of Calvera's men are dispatched to reconnoiter the village; due to a mistake by Chico, the seven are forced to kill all three. Some days later Calvera and his bandits arrive in force. The seven and the villagers kill eleven gang members and run the rest out of town. The villagers celebrate, believing Calvera will not return. However, Chico infiltrates Calvera's camp and learns that Calvera will return, as his men are short on food. Some villagers fear reprisals and call for the gunfighters to leave. Even some of the seven waver, but Chris insists that they stay.

The seven ride out for a pre-emptive raid on Calvera's camp but find it abandoned. Returning to the village, they are captured by Calvera and his men, who have colluded with some of the villagers to sneak in and take control. Calvera spares the seven's lives, part believing they have been disillusioned by the betrayal, and part fearing reprisals from their friends across the border.

Preparing to depart, Chris and Vin admit they have become emotionally attached to the village. Bernardo likewise gets angry when the boys he befriended call their parents cowards. Chico declares that he hates the villagers; when Chris points out he grew up as a farmer as well, Chico angrily responds that it is men like Calvera and Chris who made the villagers what they are.

The gang escorts the seven gunmen from the village and returns their weapons. The seven debate their next move. All agree to return and fight, except Harry, who believes the effort is futile and suicidal.

The gunmen infiltrate the village and a gunfight breaks out. Harry, who has had a change of heart, returns in time to save Chris's life but is himself fatally shot. Harry pleads to know what they were fighting for, and Chris lies about hidden gold to let Harry believe he died for a fortune; Harry smiles before dying. Lee finds the nerve to burst into a house where several villagers are being held, shooting their captors and releasing the prisoners to join the fight, but is gunned down as he leaves the house. Bernardo, shot protecting the boys he befriended, tells them as he dies to see how bravely their fathers fought. Britt dies after killing many bandits and exposing himself from cover. Chris shoots Calvera, who demands to know why he came back for the village. The remaining bandits flee.

After Chico decides to stay with Petra, Chris and Vin bid farewell to the village elder. The elder tells them that only the villagers have won, whereas the gunslingers are ""like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on."" As they pass the graves of their fallen comrades, Chris admits the elder was right.","Action, Adventure, Western","starring       = {{Plainlist|

868,Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"==Plot==
A psychiatrist is called to the room of a Los Angeles hospital, where a man named Miles Bennell is being held in custody. The man claims to be a doctor, and recounts the events leading up to his arrest and arrival at the hospital.

At work, Bennell meets a number of patients suffering from [[Capgras delusion]]. His girlfriend, Becky, has just come back to town after settling a divorce. The couple are called to the home of a friend of the doctor, Jack Belicec, who has found what appears to be a body in his home. It has no features or fingerprints, and starts to change, beginning to take on the features of Belicec. Another body is found in Becky's basement that is her duplicate. Before any further investigation can take place, the bodies disappear.

Bennell and Jack's wife Teddy find duplicates of themselves emerging from pods in Bennell's greenhouse. They conclude that the townspeople are being replaced while asleep with copies. Bennell tries to make a call to authorities, but the operator claims that all lines are busy and he cannot be put through, so Jack and Teddy drive off to seek help in the next town over. Bennell and Becky realize that all of Santa Mira's inhabitants have been replaced and are devoid of any sort of humanity. They hide at Bennell's office for the night.

Truckloads of the pods arrive downtown. Becky and Bennell listen as chief Nick Grivett directs the others to take them to towns to be planted and used to replace their populations. Kauffman and Belicec arrive at Bennell's office with pods for Becky and Bennell. It is revealed that a race of alien impostors is responsible for the invasion, and that if they aren't stopped, humanity will lose all emotions and sense of individuality.

Bennell and Becky escape from the office. To avoid capture, they mimic the impostors' mannerisms and pretend to be part of the huge crowd of replaced townspeople. However, a panicked Becky screams at a near-traffic accident and her reaction exposes their humanity to the aliens. An alarm is sounded and the couple flees on foot.

The couple manage to escape and hide in a mine outside town, however, after a while hiding they hear music, and Bennell leaves Becky briefly to investigate. He sees a farm with hundreds of pods being loaded onto trucks. Bennell returns to tell Becky, but realizes that she fell asleep before he could return and is now one of them. Becky sounds the alarm as Bennell runs away. Desperate, he screams at the drivers in the highway for help.

Bennell finishes his story. Dr. Hill and the doctor step outside into the hallway. A driver is wheeled into the hall on a gurney after having been injured in an accident. The attendant recounts that the man had to be dug out from under a load of mysterious pods coming from Santa Mira. Dr. Hill alerts the police to block the roads in and out of Santa Mira. The film ends with Bennell relieved as Hill calls the Bureau of Investigation.","Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi","starring       = {{plainlist|

[[Image:Virginia Brissac, Jim Backus, Ann Doran, Edward Platt and James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause trailer.jpg|right|thumb|Jim Stark in police custody.]]

In Los Angeles during the mid-1950s, teenager Jim Stark is arrested and taken to the juvenile division of a police station for public intoxication. At the station he crosses paths with John ""Plato"" Crawford, who was brought in for killing a litter of puppies, and Judy, who was brought in for curfew violation. The three separately reveal their innermost frustrations to the officers; all three of them suffer from problems at home. Jim feels anguished by his constantly bickering parents, Frank and Carol, but even more so by his timid father's failure to stand up to Carol; the issues are further complicated by Frank's interfering mother. His frustrations are made manifest to officer Ray Fremick when Jim is released to their custody.

Judy is convinced that her father ignores her because she is no longer a little girl, so she dresses up in racy clothes to get attention, which only causes her father to call her a ""dirty tramp"", while Plato's father abandoned his family when he was a toddler, and his mother is often away from home, leaving Plato in the care of his housekeeper.

On the way to his first day at Dawson High, Jim again meets Judy and offers her a ride. Seemingly unimpressed by Jim, she declines and is instead picked up by her ""friends"", a gang of delinquents led by Buzz Gunderson who Judy is also dating. Jim is shunned by the rest of the student body but is befriended by Plato, who comes to idolize Jim, and according to Pomerance and Krauss, ""Jim is an idealized father for Plato"".<ref name=""Pomerance2008"">{{cite book |last1=Pomerance |first1=Murray |title=The Horse who Drank the Sky: Film Experience Beyond Narrative and Theory |year=2008 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-4328-4 |page=58 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaHpz5xY5IIC&pg=PA58}}</ref><ref name=""Krauss2014"">{{cite book |last1=Krauss |first1=Kenneth |title=Male Beauty: Postwar Masculinity in Theater, Film, and Physique Magazines |year=2014 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-1-4384-5001-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0_8uAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA194}}</ref>

After a [[field trip]] to [[Griffith Observatory]], Buzz provokes and challenges Jim to a knife fight; Jim bests Buzz by knocking his switchblade out of his hand, then throws his own blade away. To preserve his status as gang leader, Buzz suggests stealing some cars to have a ""[[chicken (game)|Chickie Run]]"" at a seaside cliff.<ref name=""Slocum2005"">{{cite book |last1=Slocum |first1=J.

That night, during the chickie run, Buzz plunges to his death when the strap on his jacket sleeve becomes entangled with his door-latch lever, preventing him from exiting the car. As police approach, the gang flees, leaving Judy behind, but Jim persuades her to leave with him and Plato.

[[Image:Ann Doran, James Dean and Jim Backus in Rebel Without a Cause trailer.jpg|right|thumb|Jim confronts his father while his mother watches.]]
Jim later confides to his parents his involvement in the crash and considers turning himself in. When Carol declares they are moving again, Jim pleads with Frank to stand up for him. When Frank refuses, Jim attacks him in frustration, then storms off to the police station to confess, only to be turned away by the desk sergeant. Jim drives back home, finding Judy waiting for him. She apologizes for her prior treatment of him due to peer pressure, and the two begin to fall in love. Agreeing to never return to their respective homes, Jim suggests they visit an old deserted mansion Plato told him about.

Meanwhile, Plato is intercepted by three members of Buzz's gang, who are convinced that Jim betrayed them to the police. They steal Plato's address book and pursue Jim; Plato retrieves his mother's gun and leaves to warn Jim and Judy, finding them at the mansion. The three new friends act out a fantasy as a family. Plato then falls asleep, and Jim and Judy leave to explore the mansion, where they share their first kiss. Buzz's gang find and wake up Plato, who, frightened and distraught, shoots and wounds one of the gang. When Jim returns, he attempts to restrain Plato, who flees, accusing Jim of abandoning him.

Plato runs to the observatory and barricades himself inside as more police converge including Fremick who, along with Frank and Carol, has been searching for Jim. Jim and Judy follow Plato into the observatory, where Jim persuades Plato to trade the gun for his red jacket; Jim quietly removes the ammunition before returning it, and then convinces Plato to come outside. When the police notice that Plato still has the gun, they shoot Plato dead as he charges them, unaware that Jim had removed the bullets. Frank comforts his grieving son, vowing to be a better father. Now reconciled with his parents, Jim introduces them to Judy.",Drama,"starring       = [[James Dean]]<br />[[Natalie Wood]]<br />[[Sal Mineo]]<br>[[Jim Backus]]<br>[[Ann Doran]]<br>[[Corey Allen]]<br>[[William Hopper]]

872,The Quiet Man,"==Plot==
<!--Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], the summary must contain only the most essential info and not exceed 700 words. Current wordcount 639.--->
In the 1920s, Sean ""Trooper Thorn"" Thornton, an Irish-born American retired [[Boxer (boxing)|boxer]], travels from [[Pittsburgh]] to his birthplace of Inisfree to purchase the old family farm.{{efn|The spelling of the fictional village ""Inisfree"" can vary in spelling in some film reviews and articles, often being cited ""Innisfree"". In the film, however, the public notices announcing the upcoming horse race are boldly printed ""INISFREE RACE MEET"".}} Shortly after arriving, he meets and falls in love with fiery, red-headed Mary Kate Danaher, the sister of bullying Squire ""Red"" Will Danaher. Will also wants to buy the old Thornton property, and is angered when the property's current owner, the wealthy Widow Tillane, accepts Sean's bid instead of his. Will then retaliates by refusing consent for Sean to marry his sister.

Some village residents, including parish priest Father Peter Lonergan and local [[Matchmaking|matchmaker]]-cum-[[bookmaker]] Michaeleen Óge Flynn,{{efn|Michaeleen’s full name includes ""Óge"", which in [[Comparison of Scottish Gaelic and Irish|Irish]] translates to ""young"" in English. Óge is used to distinguish between a father and his son with the same name, much in the manner that the suffixes ""Sr."" and ""Jr."" do in English.}} trick Will Danaher into believing that Widow Tillane will marry him if Mary Kate is no longer under his roof. He gleefully allows the marriage, but he refuses to give Mary Kate her [[dowry]] when he finds he was deceived, and the Widow Tillane knows nothing about the deal. Sean, unschooled in Irish customs, professes no interest in obtaining the dowry; but to Mary Kate, the dowry represents her personal value to the community and her freedom. She insists that the dowry must be received to validate their marriage, causing an estrangement between her and Sean. The villagers eventually persuade Will to release Mary Kate's furniture (which she owns), but Will refuses to hand over the monetary part of the dowry (which is his contribution).

Mary Kate believes Sean is a coward for not fighting Will. Sean goes to the local [[Church of Ireland]] minister and fellow former boxer, the Rev. Cyril Playfair, and reveals that he once accidentally killed a younger, married opponent in the ring. Sean had sworn to give up fighting out of fear and guilt over the manslaughter. Mary Kate also confesses (in [[Irish Gaelic]]) her part in the quarrel to Father Lonergan, who berates her for her selfishness. She and Sean partially reconcile that night, and they share the bedroom for the first time since their marriage.

However, the next morning, Mary Kate quietly leaves their cottage and boards a train for [[Dublin]], hoping this pretense of leaving will spur Sean to action. Sean soon learns from Michaeleen where she is, races his horse to the railway station, and pulls her off the train. Followed by a growing crowd of villagers, Sean forces Mary Kate to walk with him the {{convert|5|mi|spell=in|sigfig=1}} back to the Danaher farm. There, Sean confronts Will and demands the dowry money. When Will refuses, Sean throws Mary Kate back at her brother, declaring he will abide by the Irish custom ""no fortune, no marriage"". The ultimatum shocks both Mary Kate and Will, who finally pays the £350 (over £17,000 in 2022). Sean immediately burns it in the boiler, abetted by Mary Kate. She proudly leaves for home, but a humiliated Will takes a swing at Sean, only to be knocked down by Sean's defensive counter-punch.

A donnybrook ensues, then evolves into a long Homeric fistfight between Sean and Will after they insincerely agree to adhere to the [[Marquess of Queensberry rules]]. This much-anticipated match attracts more and more spectators as it continues for miles across the landscape. The fighters finally pause for a drink inside Cohan's Bar, where they begrudgingly admit a mutual respect for one another. As they argue over who will pay for the drinks, Will tosses a brew into Sean's face. Sean punches Will, sending him falling through the bar doors to lie unconscious in the street, ending the fight. Later, the reconciled and inebriated brothers-in-law stagger arm-in-arm back to Sean and Mary Kate's home for supper, much to Mary Kate's amusement and delight.

The next day, a humbled Will and the Widow Tillane begin their own courtship, and they ride out of the village side by side in a [[jaunting car]] driven by Michaeleen. Sean, Mary Kate, and the villagers wave to them as they pass, before Sean and Mary Kate playfully chase each other across the fields back to the cottage.","Comedy, Drama, Romance","starring       = {{Plainlist|

873,The Day the Earth Stood Still,"==Plot==
After a [[flying saucer]] lands in [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[United States Army]] quickly surrounds it. A humanoid emerges and announces that he comes ""in peace and with good will"". When he unexpectedly opens a small device, he is shot and wounded by a nervous soldier. A tall robot emerges from the saucer and quickly disintegrates the soldiers' weapons. The alien orders the robot, [[Gort (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Gort]], to desist. He explains that the now-broken device was a gift for the [[President of the United States]] that would have enabled him ""to study life on the other planets"".

The alien, [[Klaatu (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Klaatu]], is taken to [[Walter Reed Army Hospital]]. After surgery, he uses a salve to quickly heal his wound. The Army is unable to enter the saucer. Gort stands outside, silent and unmoving.

Klaatu tells the President's secretary, Mr. Harley, that he has a message that must be delivered to all the world's leaders simultaneously. Harley tells him that in the current world situation, this is impossible. Klaatu proposes that he spend time among ordinary humans to better understand their ""unreasoning suspicions and attitudes"". Harley rejects the proposal, and Klaatu remains locked in his hospital room.

Klaatu escapes and stays in a boarding house using the name Mr. Carpenter, adopted from a dry cleaner's suit tag. Among the residents are young widow Helen Benson and her son Bobby. Helen's boyfriend, Tom Stevens, becomes jealous of the stranger.

Bobby takes Klaatu on a tour of the city, including a visit to his father's grave in [[Arlington National Cemetery]]; Klaatu learns that most of the dead are soldiers killed in wars. They also visit the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. When Klaatu asks Bobby, ""Who is the greatest living person?"", Bobby suggests Professor Barnhardt. They visit the scientist's home, but he is out; Klaatu sees that Barnhardt's blackboard is covered with equations (an attempt to solve the [[three-body problem]]). Klaatu adds to them and, after being discovered by the housekeeper, leaves his contact information.

That evening, a government agent escorts Klaatu to Barnhardt. Klaatu tells Barnhardt that the people of other planets are concerned about Earth's possible aggression, now that humanity has developed rockets and rudimentary [[atomic power]]. He states that if his message is ignored, Earth could be ""eliminated"". Barnhardt agrees to gather scientists from around the world at the saucer; he also suggests that Klaatu peacefully demonstrate the power he possesses beforehand.

Klaatu returns to his spaceship, unaware that Bobby is following him. Bobby watches as Gort knocks out two soldiers so Klaatu can reenter the saucer. Bobby runs home and tells Helen. She does not believe him, but Tom is suspicious.

The next day, for half an hour, starting at 12 noon east coast time, all electrical equipment on Earth ceases to function,<ref name=""dailyscript"">{{cite web|last=North|first=Edmund H.|url=http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/the_day_the_earth_stood_still.html|title=The Day the Earth Stood Still|website=dailyscript.com|date=February 21, 1951 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901095344/http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/the_day_the_earth_stood_still.html |archive-date=1 September 2006 |quote=Klaatu: You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.}}</ref> except for essential services, such as hospitals and aircraft in flight.

Klaatu learns that Bobby watched him the previous night. He visits Helen at work, reveals his mission, and asks that she not betray him. Helen asks Tom to keep Klaatu's identity secret, but he refuses to listen, already in the process of alerting the military.

Helen and Klaatu rush to Barnhardt's home. They hope that Barnhardt can hide Klaatu until the meeting that evening. Klaatu tells Helen that if anything should happen to him, she must go to Gort and say, ""[[Klaatu barada nikto]].""

The Army tracks them in their taxi. Klaatu is shot and killed, and his body is moved to a nearby police station cell. Helen rushes to the saucer and says Klaatu's phrase to Gort. Gort retrieves Klaatu's body, and revives him inside the saucer, though Klaatu tells Helen that his revival is only temporary.

875,Gilda,"==Plot==
Johnny Farrell, an American newly arrived in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], wins a lot of money cheating at [[craps]]. He is rescued from a robbery attempt by a complete stranger, Ballin Mundson. Although Farrell is warned not to cheat at an illegal high-class casino he tells him about, he ignores his advice. After winning at [[blackjack]], he is taken to see the casino's owner, who turns out to be Mundson. Farrell talks him into hiring him and soon becomes Mundson's trusted casino manager.

Mundson returns from a trip and announces he has an extremely beautiful new wife, Gilda, whom he has married after only knowing her for a day. Johnny and she instantly recognise each other from the past, though both deny it when he questions them. Mundson assigns Farrell to watch over Gilda. The pair are consumed with hatred for each other, and she cavorts with men at all hours in increasingly more blatant efforts to enrage Johnny, and in return he grows more spiteful towards her.

Mundson is visited by two [[Germans|German]] mobsters. Their organisation had financed a [[tungsten]] [[cartel]], with everything put in Mundson's name in order to hide their connection to it. They have decided that it is safe to take over the cartel now that [[World War II]] has ended, but Mundson refuses to transfer ownership.

The Argentinian police are suspicious of the Germans and assign agent Obregón to try to obtain information from Farrell, but he knows nothing about this aspect of Mundson's operations. The Germans return to the casino during a carnival celebration, and Mundson ends up deliberately shooting and killing one of them..

Farrell rushes to take Gilda to safety. Alone in Mundson's house, they have another confrontation and, after declaring their undying hatred for each other, passionately kiss. After hearing the front door slam, they realise Mundson has overheard them, and a guilt-ridden Farrell pursues him to a waiting private airplane. The plane explodes in midair and plummets into the ocean. Mundson parachutes to safety. Farrell, unaware of this, concludes that he is dead.

Gilda inherits his estate. Farrell and she immediately marry, but unknown to her Johnny is marrying her to punish her for her betrayal of Mundson, which is hypocritical, since he also betrayed Mundson's trust. He abandons her, but has her followed day and night by his men to torment her. Gilda tries to escape the tortured marriage a number of times, but Farrell thwarts every attempt.

Obregón confiscates the casino and informs Farrell that Gilda was never truly unfaithful to Mundson or to him, prompting Farrell to try to reconcile with her as he prepares to return home to the U.S. At that moment, Mundson reappears, revealing his faked suicide. He tries to kill both Gilda and Farrell, but the casino worker, Uncle Pío, fatally stabs him in the back. When Obregón arrives, Johnny tries to take the blame for the murder, but Obregón points out that, since Mundson was already declared legally dead, he can't arrest him.

Farrell gives Obregón incriminating documents from Mundson's safe. He and Gilda finally reconcile, agreeing to go home together.

882,The Florida Project,"==Plot==
Moonee, a six-year-old girl, lives with her young, single mother, Halley, at Magic Castle Inn and Suites, a budget [[motel]] in [[Kissimmee, Florida]], near [[Walt Disney World]]. Moonee spends most of her summer days unsupervised and making mischief with her downstairs neighbor, Scooty (whom Halley is supposed to watch while his mother, Ashley, works as a waitress at a diner), and Dicky, who lives at the nearby Futureland Inn. After Stacy, a new Futureland resident, catches the trio spitting on her car, Dicky is grounded for a week, and Moonee and Scooty meet and befriend Stacy's granddaughter, Jancey, who lives with Stacy.

Halley has recently lost her job as a [[stripper]] after refusing to have sex with clients, but this now affects her eligibility for [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families|TANF]] benefits; she begins relying on food that Ashley gets from work. Struggling to pay the rent, Halley begins selling knockoff perfume to tourists in the parking lots of upscale hotels. Meanwhile, Moonee and Scooty show Jancey around the neighborhood and teach her things, like how to get ice cream by begging. They regularly inconvenience Bobby, the Magic Castle's manager, once shutting off the motel's power. Despite this, he remains protective of them. Bobby's duties include preparing expense reports, ejecting drug dealers, and doing repairs; he sometimes enlists the help of his son, Jack, with whom he has a tenuous relationship.

After Dicky's family moves to [[New Orleans]], Scooty finds a lighter in a box that Dicky's family left behind; he, Moonee, and Jancey start a fire at an abandoned [[Condominium|condominium complex]]. Seeing the fire, Ashley figures out that Scooty was involved, and forbids him from hanging out with Moonee or Jancey; she also stops talking to Halley.

Without the free food from Ashley, and with security guards beginning to bother her at the hotels, Halley's financial situation declines even further. She begins soliciting sex work online, keeping Moonee in the bathroom with loud music when she has a client over. When Halley steals a client's Disney World [[MagicBands|resort passes]] to [[ticket resale|scalp]] them, he returns to demand them back. Bobby scares him off but applies restrictions on unregistered guests in Halley's room; he also warns her that he will evict her if she continues having clients over. In desperation, Halley approaches Ashley to apologize and ask for money. Ashley criticizes Halley for doing sex work; enraged, Halley viciously beats her in front of Scooty.

The next day, [[Florida Department of Children and Families|DCF]] investigators show up and question Halley and Moonee separately about their lifestyle. In anticipation of another visit, Halley gives away her [[Cannabis (drug)|weed]] and has Moonee help clean their room. They go to a fancier hotel and have an extravagant meal, which Halley charges to a guest's room. When they return to Magic Castle, the investigators, having found evidence of Halley's sex work, are waiting with two police officers to take Moonee into [[foster care]] while they finish their inquiry. Not fully understanding what is happening, Moonee asks to say goodbye to Scooty, who lets slip that she is going to a new family. Upset, Moonee runs away from the investigators to bid Jancey goodbye. Seeing her friend's distress, Jancey grabs Moonee's hand and the two run away to Walt Disney World's [[Magic Kingdom]] [[Amusement park|theme park]].",Drama,"starring       = {{Plainlist|

883,Just Mercy,"==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 to 700 words. -->
In 1989, [[Harvard Law School|Harvard law]] graduate [[Bryan Stevenson]] travels to [[Alabama]], intending to help defend poor people who cannot afford proper legal representation. Teaming with Eva Ansley, he forms the [[Equal Justice Initiative]] in the state capital, [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. He embarks on trying to combat social injustices in criminal law and practice, which have resulted in a high rate of African Americans convicted and incarcerated in the state and nationwide.

Stevenson goes to a state prison to meet inmates who are on [[death row]] and who are seeking appeals of their convictions or sentences. Among these is [[Walter McMillian|Walter ""Johnny D."" McMillian]], an African-American man who was convicted of the 1986 murder of Ronda Morrison, an 18-year-old white girl. McMillian has maintained his innocence.

When Stevenson reviews the evidence in the case, he learns that it hinges entirely on the testimony of convicted felon Ralph Myers. The convict had provided highly contradictory testimony to the prosecution in exchange for a plea deal and lighter sentence in his own pending trial.

Given these issues, Stevenson appeals to the current prosecutor, Tommy Chapman, for aid; he dismisses him without looking at his notes. Stevenson learns that, at the time of the murder, McMillian's family friend Darnell Houston was elsewhere with a witness who had subsequently falsely corroborated Myers' testimony. This evidence would cause the prosecution's case to fall apart, so Stevenson asks Houston to testify to his account. When Stevenson submits his testimony, police arrest Houston for [[perjury]].

Although Stevenson gets the perjury charges dismissed, Houston is intimidated, so he refuses to testify in court. Shortly afterward, Stevenson is threatened by two sheriff deputies, who force him from his car at gunpoint and illegally search the car. They refuse to tell him why he was pulled over, but release him.

During this period, Stevenson had a case on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of another death row inmate, [[Herbert Lee Richardson]]; the court denied the appeal. Convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend’s niece with a bomb on her porch, Richardson had been sentenced to death by electric chair. Unable to get it overturned, Stevenson promises to be with Richardson in his final moments and witnesses the execution.

On behalf of McMillian, Stevenson directly confronts Myers. He admits that police coerced his testimony by threatening him with a death sentence. Stevenson appeals to the local court to grant McMillian a retrial and successfully convinces Myers to recant his testimony on the stand, but the judge refuses to grant it.

Stevenson appears on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' to rally public support in favor of McMillian, and appeals the court's decision to the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]. The Supreme Court overturns the circuit court's decision, and grants McMillian a retrial. Stevenson tries to have the charges dismissed entirely. He confronts Chapman at home and tries to convince him to join in this motion; Chapman forces him to leave.

On the day of the motion, Stevenson appeals to the judge. That day, Chapman joins him in the motion, the judge dismisses the charges, and McMillian is finally released from prison and reunited with his family.

An epilogue notes that Stevenson and Ansley continue their fight for justice. McMillian remained friends with Stevenson until his natural death in 2013. A follow-up investigation into Morrison's 1986 murder confirmed McMillian's innocence. Evidence suggested that a white man was likely responsible, but the case has never been officially solved. McMillian's former cellmate, [[Anthony Ray Hinton]], remained on death row for 28 years. Stevenson handled his defense and was eventually able to get all the charges dropped. Hinton was released in 2015.","Biography, Crime, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|

Zak, a young man with [[Down syndrome]], escapes from a state-run care facility with the help of his elderly roommate, to train as a professional wrestler under the tutelage of his hero, the Salt Water Redneck. Meanwhile, Tyler, a man fired for bringing in illegal crab catches, burns the gear of his rivals, Duncan and Ratboy, and flees himself.

While on the run, Zak and Tyler meet, and embark on a journey to the Salt Water Redneck's wrestling school in North Carolina. Zak's caretaker at the nursing home, Eleanor, sets out to find Zak and return him safely to the facility. Zak and Tyler become friends while traveling. Tyler teaches Zak various life skills, including how to use a shotgun, and eventually takes on the role of his coach, getting him in shape for his wrestling endeavors. They build a raft and begin traveling by water. Eleanor soon finds them, but after learning her boss intends to send Zak to a more severe form of confinement, joins them to travel south. That night, Duncan and Ratboy catch up with the trio, and Zak defends them with a shotgun.

When they reach [[Ayden, North Carolina]], Tyler learns that the Salt Water Redneck has retired and closed the school, but convinces him to resurrect his alter ego for Zak. Salt Water trains Zak as a wrestler, and quickly puts Zak on a local fight card, which he believes he has rigged for Zak's safety and success. However, when the fight happens, Zak's opponent, Sam, does not hold back, and proceeds to beat him. As Tyler attempts to intervene, Duncan and Ratboy arrive, and Duncan hits Tyler on the head with a tire iron, knocking him unconscious right as Zak manages to lift Sam overhead and throw him forcefully out of the ring, something Salt Water had told him was impossible. The film ends with Tyler healing from the injury, as Eleanor drives him and Zak to Florida, implying the start of a new life for the three of them as a family.","Adventure, Comedy, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|

888,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"== Plot ==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->
In 2014, [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]], [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]], [[Drax (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax]], [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and [[Baby Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Baby Groot]] are renowned as the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. [[Ayesha (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|High Priestess Ayesha]] of the [[Sovereign (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sovereign]] race has the Guardians protect valuable Anulax batteries from an Abilisk, an inter-dimensional monster, in exchange for [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]], Gamora's estranged sister, who was caught attempting to steal the batteries. After Rocket steals the batteries for himself, the Sovereign attacks the Guardians' ship with a fleet of drones. A mysterious figure destroys the drones and the Guardians crash-land on nearby planet Berhert. The figure reveals himself as [[Ego (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ego]], Quill's father, and he introduces [[Mantis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mantis]], his naïve [[wikt:empath|empath]] servant. Ego invites Quill, Gamora, and Drax to his home planet, while Rocket and Groot remain behind to repair the ship and watch Nebula.

Ayesha hires [[Yondu Udonta (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Yondu Udonta]] and his crew, who have been exiled from the greater [[Ravagers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ravager]] community by Ravager leader [[Stakar Ogord (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stakar Ogord]] for [[Trafficking of children|child trafficking]], to recapture the Guardians. They capture Rocket, but when Yondu hesitates to turn over Quill, whom he raised, his lieutenant [[Kraglin Obfonteri]] questions his objectivity, and [[Taserface (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Taserface]], another lieutenant, leads a mutiny, aided by Nebula, who shoots Yondu. Taserface executes Yondu's loyalists, and imprisons him and Rocket aboard Yondu's ship. Nebula leaves to find and kill Gamora, whom she blames for the torture inflicted on her by [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]], their adoptive father. Kraglin, who is remorseful and never signed up for a mutiny, helps Groot free Rocket and Yondu, and while escaping, the group set the ship to self-destruct using Yondu's arrow. Taserface informs the Sovereign before being killed by the explosion.

Ego, a god-like [[Celestials (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Celestial]] that manipulated the matter around his consciousness to form his ""home"" planet, explains that he projected a humanoid guise to travel the universe and discover a purpose, eventually falling in love with Quill's mother [[Meredith Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Meredith]]. Ego hired Yondu to collect the young Quill after Meredith's death, but the boy was never delivered, and Ego has been searching for him ever since. He teaches Quill to manipulate his inherited Celestial power, while Mantis grows close to Drax and tries to warn him of Ego's plans. Nebula arrives at Ego's planet and tries to kill Gamora, but the pair reconcile and reach an uneasy alliance, soon discovering a cavern filled with skeletal remains. Ego [[Brainwashing|brainwashes]] Quill and reveals that in his travels, he planted seedlings on thousands of worlds that can [[Terraforming|terraform]] into new extensions of himself, but only the power of two Celestials can activate them. He adds that he impregnated countless women and hired Yondu to collect their offspring but killed them all when they failed to inherit his Celestial power. When Ego admits that he gave Meredith the brain tumor that killed her, an infuriated Quill breaks out of his brainwashing and violently attacks him. Ego then parasitically draws Quill's energy to activate the seedlings, which begin to consume the worlds on which they are planted.

Rocket, Yondu, Groot, and Kraglin arrive, and together with Mantis, Drax, Nebula and Gamora, they rescue Quill. The reunited Guardians travel to Ego's brain at the planet's core, where Yondu reveals that he kept Quill to spare him from Ego. As the Sovereign's drones return and attack, Rocket makes a bomb using the stolen batteries, which Groot plants on Ego's brain. Quill uses his newfound Celestial powers to fight Ego, distracting him long enough for the other Guardians and Mantis to escape. The bomb explodes, killing Ego and disintegrating the planet, but also draining Quill of his Celestial powers. Yondu sacrifices himself to save Quill by letting himself die in the vacuum of space. Despite having reconciled with Gamora, Nebula chooses to leave and resume her quest to kill Thanos. The Guardians, with Mantis as a new member, hold a funeral for Yondu as dozens of Ravager ships arrive, having heard of Yondu's sacrifice and accept him as a Ravager again.

889,Baby Driver,"==Plot==
<!-- KEEP PLOT SUMMARY WITHIN 700 WORDS PER [[WP:FILMPLOT]] -->In [[Atlanta]], Miles, self-named ""Baby"", is a young [[getaway driver]] who lost his parents in a car crash that left him with [[tinnitus]], and finds [[wikt: catharsis|catharsis]] in music. He ferries crews of robbers assembled by kingpin Doc to pay off a debt as recompense for theft of a car containing Doc's illicit goods. Between jobs, he remixes snippets of recorded conversations and cares for his deaf foster father Joseph. At the local diner, Bo’s Diner, he meets a waitress named Debora, and they start dating.

His next robbery goes awry after an armed bystander chases them down, but Baby evades him and the police. Having paid his debt, Baby quits his life of crime and starts delivering pizzas. Baby takes Debora out on a date at a fancy restaurant where he runs into Doc, who pays for their meal. Meeting Baby outside, Doc convinces him to join his planned post-office heist under threat of retaliation. The crew consists of easygoing Buddy, his sharpshooter wife Darling, and trigger-happy psychopath Bats, who takes a dislike to Baby. While the crew attempts to purchase illegal arms at a rendezvous from a contact of Doc's, The Butcher, Bats recognizes the Butcher and his men are undercover police and opens fire, resulting in most of the dealers being killed. Afterward, Bats makes Baby stop at Debora's diner, unaware of Baby and Debora's romance. Baby, aware of Bats' homicidal habit, stops him from killing her to avoid paying.

Doc is furious, revealing that the dealers were [[dirty cops]] on his payroll. He decides to cancel the heist, but Bats, Buddy and Darling disagree. Doc lets Baby decide; he chooses to go through with it. Baby attempts to slip away late that night, hoping to take Debora and leave. He is stopped by Buddy and Bats, who have discovered his recordings and believe he is a police informant; when they and Doc hear his mixtapes, they are convinced of his innocence.

During the heist, Bats kills a security guard. Disgusted, Baby refuses to drive away, causing Bats to hit him. Baby rams the car into a [[rebar]] which impales Bats, killing him. The three flee on foot. After the police kill Darling in a shootout, Buddy furiously blames Baby for her death and plans to kill him. Baby steals a car and flees to his apartment. After leaving Joseph at an assisted living home with his heist earnings, Baby rushes to Bo's for Debora, where Buddy is waiting. Baby shoots Buddy and flees with Debora as police reinforcements swarm the restaurant.

At the safe house, Doc refuses Baby's pleas for help, but relents when he sees Debora consoling him. Doc supplies them with cash and an escape route out of the country. The three are confronted by the Butcher's vengeful henchmen in the parking garage, but Doc kills them all. Buddy ambushes them with a stolen police car and kills Doc. A cat-and-mouse game ensues until Buddy has Baby at his mercy. He shoots next to both Baby's ears, temporarily disorienting him, but the distraction allows Debora to subdue Buddy with a crowbar. After Baby shoots him in the leg, Buddy falls to his death.

Baby surrenders after he and Debora encounter a police roadblock. At Baby's trial, Joseph, Debora, and other individuals Baby helped testify as [[character witness]]es. He is sentenced to 25 years in prison, with a parole hearing after five. Debora stays in contact with Baby during his incarceration, and once he is released, they reunite with a new car and drive off into the sunset.","Action, Crime, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|

Human civilization has been destroyed after societal collapse among humans. The apes, all bestowed with genetically enhanced intelligence by the virus, establish a colony in the Muir Woods National Monument near San Francisco, led by [[Caesar (Planet of the Apes)|Caesar]], along with his lieutenants [[Maurice (Planet of the Apes)|Maurice]], [[Rocket (Planet of the Apes)|Rocket]], and [[Koba (Planet of the Apes)|Koba]].

A group of humans, led by Malcolm, unknowingly enter the apes' territory in search of a hydroelectric dam that would restore power to their community in San Francisco. Carver, a member of Malcolm's group, injures Ash, Rocket's young son, in fear. Malcolm manages to prevent further escalation, and Caesar orders the humans to leave. Prompted by Koba, Caesar brings his army to the human community as a show of strength. Caesar announces that, while the apes do not want war, they will fight to defend themselves; he demands the humans stay in their territory. Malcolm convinces Dreyfus, the community's leader, to give him a chance to take a small team to the forest to negotiate with the apes and access the dam. Eventually, Caesar allows them to work on the generator on the condition that they surrender their guns. While working together, Malcolm, his nurse wife Ellie, and his son Alexander bond with the apes. The fragile truce briefly falls apart when Carver is discovered to have kept a hidden gun and is thus forcibly sent away, but trust is restored when Ellie saves Cornelia, Caesar's ill wife.

Concerned that the apes may attack, Dreyfus arms the community with the munitions at the Fort Point armory. Koba, who hated the humans for torturing him as a laboratory test subject, discovers the armory and confronts Caesar, accusing him of caring more about humans than apes. Caesar beats Koba in response but refrains from killing him. Koba kills two guards in the armory to steal a gun and returns home. He secretly kills Carver after the humans succeed in repairing the generator. Koba uses their celebration to covertly set fire to the ape colony. Unseen by the others, he shoots Caesar, who falls into the underbrush. Koba frames the humans for Caesar's apparent death and the fire to justify war. Taking command, he leads the ape army to San Francisco, where they plunder the armory and mount a full-scale assault on the humans. Despite taking heavy casualties, the apes breach the building and imprison the humans as Dreyfus flees. Koba kills Ash for refusing to kill unarmed humans and imprisons all other apes loyal to Caesar, including Rocket, Maurice, and Luca.

Malcolm's family finds a severely wounded Caesar and transports him to his former home in San Francisco. After sneaking back into the settlement to find medical supplies, Malcolm encounters Blue Eyes, Caesar's young son. Blue Eyes has him at gunpoint but decides to let him go until he learns from Malcolm that his father is still alive. Blue Eyes accompanies Malcolm to Caesar. Learning that it was Koba who shot Caesar, Blue Eyes reconciles with his father. The trio returns to the community and frees the imprisoned humans and apes. After escorting the apes into the tower, Malcolm finds Dreyfus, who has rigged the base of the tower with C-4, and reveals that his men made contact with a military base. Malcolm holds Dreyfus and his men at gunpoint to give Caesar enough time to retake command by confronting Koba at the top of the tower. In an attempt to kill all the apes, Dreyfus detonates explosives to destabilize the building, killing himself in the process. Caesar defeats Koba and refuses to help him as he falls to his death.

Malcolm warns Caesar of the approaching human military. Believing that the humans will never forgive the apes for their attack, Caesar tells Malcolm to leave with his family for safety before the fighting begins. He then addresses the apes as they prepare for the upcoming war.","Action, Adventure, Drama","starring       = {{Plainlist|

[[Los Angeles Police Department]] [[police officer|officer]]s Brian Taylor and Mike Zavala are close friends and partners in the LAPD's Newton Division, assigned to patrol a high crime area of [[South Central Los Angeles]]. Taylor, a [[United States Marine Corps]] veteran, records their activities for a college class after they return to duty from a recent [[Police use of deadly force in the United States|officer-involved shooting]].

At a public disturbance call, Tre, a [[Bloods]] gang member, yells racial insults at Zavala, who responds by accepting a one-on-one fistfight. Zavala wins and earns Tre's respect for not charging him with assault. Later that night, Tre and his fellow Bloods are attacked in a [[drive-by shooting]] by the [[Mexican-American]] Curbside Gang. The following night, the officers respond to a noise complaint at a house party, where Taylor and Zavala encounter Curbside Gang members ""Big Evil"" and ""LaLa"". Taylor and Zavala rescue children from a house fire while on patrol and are awarded the [[Los Angeles Police Medal of Valor|Medal of Valor]].

During a [[traffic stop]], they arrest a man who is in possession of several ornate firearms and large amounts of cash. Taylor urges Zavala to join him in investigating further, leading them to another man guarding a home full of [[human trafficking]] victims. When [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]] agents intervene, the officers learn that the house is tied to the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] and are strongly urged to stay clear due to possible reprisals. Taylor soon becomes engaged to his girlfriend Janet and Zavala's wife Gabby gives birth to their first child.

One night, Taylor and Zavala respond to a call from their [[rookie]] fellow officer, Sook. Arriving on scene, they find her partner Van Hauser has been stabbed through the eye, and rescue Sook from being savagely beaten nearby; both survive but promptly retire. Taylor marries Janet, and at their wedding Zavala tells Taylor that, should anything happen to him, he will take care of Janet. The next day, the officers are called to perform a wellness check on an elderly woman, but in her house they discover large amounts of [[heroin]], dismembered corpses, and a message from the cartel. Unbeknownst to them, the ICE has eavesdropped on a cartel phone call ordering the two officers ""[[Contract killing|green-lit]]"" for assassination; Big Evil, LaLa, and others are tasked with killing them.

While on patrol, the officers encounter Tre who, as a favor from their earlier encounter, warns them that some friends who were recently released from [[Folsom State Prison]] learned that both officers were green-lit, but Taylor and Zavala shrug it off. Taylor reveals to Zavala that Janet is pregnant. Taylor and Zavala are baited into chasing a reckless driver into an apartment complex where they are ambushed by the Curbside Gang. They kill several gangsters and fight their way into an alley, but Taylor is shot in the chest. As Zavala tries to treat Taylor's injuries, the assassins arrive and fire on the officers, apparently killing them. Shortly after, LAPD backup arrives in force and guns down the assassins when they refuse to surrender.

Zavala is killed, but Taylor survives, having been shielded by Zavala's body. At Zavala's funeral, Taylor tries to deliver a [[eulogy]], but only manages to say a single sentence: ""He was my brother"". In a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to the day of the shooting, Zavala recounts to Taylor a humorous story from the first time he and his wife slept together, before the two receive a call from dispatch.","Action, Crime, Drama","starring       = {{plainlist|

913,Zombieland,"==Plot==
Two months since a [[Strain (biology)|strain]] of [[mad cow disease]] mutated to become infectious to humans and turn them into zombies, survivors of the epidemic are advised to use their city of origin as nicknames when meeting other survivors, to not get too attached to them and protect themselves. Columbus, a former college student with a unique set of zombie survival rules, travels from [[Austin, Texas]], towards [[Columbus, Ohio]], to search for his parents. On the way, he meets Tallahassee, who somewhat reluctantly agrees to give Columbus a ride towards Ohio. On the way, he mentions to Columbus that he misses his puppy, Buck, who was killed by zombies.

The pair meet [[Confidence trick|con artist]] sisters Wichita and Little Rock, who trick Tallahassee and Columbus and steal their weapons and [[Cadillac Escalade|Escalade]] after Little Rock feigns being bitten by a zombie. The two men find a yellow [[Hummer H2]] loaded with weapons and continue on before running into another trap set by the girls, who take them hostage. Tallahassee steals his gun back and has a stand-off with Wichita, until Columbus intervenes saying that they have bigger problems to worry about, resulting in an uneasy truce between them.

The sisters reveal they are going to the Pacific Playland [[amusement park]] in [[Los Angeles]], an area supposedly free of zombies. After learning his hometown has been destroyed, and his parents likely killed, Columbus and Tallahassee decide to accompany them to the amusement park. When the group reaches Hollywood, Tallahassee directs them to [[Bill Murray]]'s house. Tallahassee and Wichita meet Murray, uninfected and disguised as a zombie, and they play a prank on Columbus and Little Rock by having him pretend to be a zombie, only for Columbus to accidentally kill Murray. 
Columbus soon realizes that ""Buck"" was actually Tallahassee's son, who got infected and died as a result.

Despite Wichita and Columbus falling for each other, Wichita abruptly leaves with Little Rock for Pacific Playland the next morning. Columbus decides to go after Wichita and convinces Tallahassee to join him. At Pacific Playland, the sisters activate all the rides and lights, only to unwittingly draw the attention of many zombies in the area. They become trapped on a drop tower ride as Tallahassee and Columbus arrive. Tallahassee lures the zombies to a game booth and kills several as Columbus heads to the drop tower; he evades and shoots through a horde and safely helps the girls down. Wichita kisses Columbus and reveals her real name: Krista. Deciding to stick together from now on, the group then leaves Pacific Playland.

A running gag (and a central theme throughout the film) is the list of rules Columbus comes up with for surviving in the zombie-infested world. By the end of the film, his list has 33 rules, yet only a few are mentioned.

Tim Thomas, sending a [[text message]] while driving, caused a car crash in which seven people died: six strangers and his fiancee, Sarah Jenson. In a bid for redemption, and unable to live with the guilt of his actions, Tim sets out to save the lives of seven good people.

A year after the crash, having quit his job as an [[aeronautical engineer]], Tim donates a [[lung]] lobe to his brother Ben, an [[IRS]] employee. Six months later he donates part of his liver to social services worker Holly. After that, he begins searching for more candidates to receive donations. He finds George, a junior hockey coach, and donates a kidney to him, and donates bone marrow to a young boy, Nicholas.

Tim contacts Holly and asks if she knows anyone who deserves help. She suggests Connie Tepos, who lives with an abusive boyfriend, so he gives her his number in case she wants his help. Tim moves out of his house and into a local motel, taking with him his pet [[box jellyfish]]. One night, after being beaten, Connie contacts Tim, who gives her the keys and deed to his beach house. She takes her two children and they move into their new home.

Having stolen his brother's credentials, and presenting himself as Ben, Tim checks out candidates for his two final donations. The first is Ezra Turner, a blind meat salesman and pianist. Tim calls him at work, harassing him, to check if he is quick to anger. Ezra remains calm, so Tim decides he is worthy.

He then contacts Emily Posa, a self-employed greeting card printer who has a heart condition and a rare blood type. Tim spends time with her, weeding her garden and fixing her rare [[Original Heidelberg Platen Press|Heidelberg Windmill press]]. He begins to fall in love with her and decides that, as her condition has worsened, he needs to make his donation.

Ben tracks down Tim at Emily's, demanding that Tim return his IRS credentials. After an interlude with Emily, Tim leaves her sleeping and returns to the motel. He fills the bathtub with ice water to preserve his vital organs, climbs in, and kills himself by pulling his box jellyfish into the water with him. His friend Dan acts as executor to ensure that his organs are donated, his heart to Emily and his [[cornea]]s to Ezra.

Afterward, Emily meets Ezra at his concert at a park, and they begin to talk.",Drama,"starring       = {{Plainlist|

Anna Khitrova, a [[Russians in the United Kingdom|Russian-British]] [[midwife]] at a [[London]] hospital, finds a [[Russian language|Russian-language]] diary on the body of Tatiana, a teenage girl who dies in childbirth, and a calling card for the Trans-Siberian Restaurant owned by Semyon, an old [[Thief in law|vor]] in the [[Russian mafia]]. Anna sets out to track down Tatiana's family so that she can find a home for the baby and meets Semyon, who offers to help. Though Anna's mother, Helen, is open to the idea, Anna's Russian uncle, Stepan, a former [[KGB]] functionary, urges caution, saying that Tatiana was a prostitute. Anna also gives Semyon a photocopy of the diary.

Semyon's driver, Nikolai Luzhin, serves as the family ""[[Fixer (person)|cleaner]]"" and bodyguard of Kirill, Semyon's son. Kirill, a drunk who repeatedly disappoints Semyon, authorizes an ill-advised hit on a rival [[Chechens|Chechen]] leader with the help of a [[Kurds|Kurdish]] associate, Azim, and without Semyon's approval. Kirill spits on the dead Chechen's body, calling him a [[Pederasty|pederast]], but Nikolai later tells Semyon that the Chechen had been spreading rumours that Kirill is gay. Nikolai removes identifying evidence from the Chechen's body and dumps it in the [[Thames]].

When Stepan finishes translating the diary, Anna learns that Semyon raped Tatiana after Kirill failed to do so, explaining that he would show Kirill how to ""break"" her. The diary also states that Semyon gave her pills to induce an [[abortion]], and Anna realizes that the baby was fathered by Semyon. Meanwhile, Semyon realizes that Anna knows the truth and visits her in hospital. They made a deal: Anna gives him the diary in exchange for the location of the girl's family. Later, Anna, Stepan and Helen meets Nikolai in a fast-food restaurant. Nikolai takes the diary but denies knowing about the deal. Semyon then orders Nikolai to kill Stepan, who soon goes missing.

As Nikolai rises in rank, Semyon sponsors him as a full member, due in part to his protection of Kirill. The dead Chechen's brothers arrive in London seeking vengeance and kill Azim's mentally handicapped nephew, whom Azim had forced to kill the Chechen. Azim confesses his role in the hit to Semyon; he forgives him in exchange for participating in a plan to save Kirill. Azim lures Nikolai into a meeting at a public baths. The Chechens, who are deceived into believing he is Kirill, ambush Nikolai. He manages to kill both hitmen, but is seriously wounded and taken to Anna's hospital.

Yuri, a high-ranking [[Scotland Yard]] officer investigating the Russian mafia, meets Nikolai in the hospital. It is revealed that Nikolai is actually an undercover [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] agent working under license from the British government. Nikolai tells Yuri to have Semyon arrested on a charge of rape, with a [[paternity test]] of Tatiana's baby as evidence, which will also allow Nikolai to take over the mafia. When Anna confronts Nikolai, he tells her that Stepan is staying in [[Edinburgh]] for his own protection.

Anna spots Kirill entering a lift and finds that Tatiana's baby is gone, replaced with a bouquet of roses. She and Nikolai then rush to the spot on the Thames where Nikolai had previously disposed of the Chechen's body and find Kirill sitting by the river, working up the courage to throw in his baby sister. Nikolai and Anna persuade him to give the baby back and Nikolai embraces Kirill, telling him that Semyon is finished, and that they will now be bosses together. Soon after, Nikolai succeeds Semyon as head of the organization, and Anna gains custody of Tatiana's baby, whom she names Christine.","Action, Crime, Drama","starring             = {{Plain list|

In August 2005, inside a small, dimly-lit cell, Dalton Russell proclaims he has committed the perfect [[bank robbery]]. In New York City, masked robbers, dressed in painter coveralls and using variants of the name ""Steve"" as aliases, seize control of a Manhattan bank, taking patrons and employees hostage. They divide the hostages into groups and hold them in different rooms, forcing them to don masks and coveralls identical to their own, rotating them among various rooms and occasionally inserting themselves covertly into the groups. They also take turns demolishing the floor in one of the bank's storage rooms.

Police surround the bank, and Detectives Keith Frazier and Bill Mitchell take charge of negotiations. Russell, the head robber, demands food be provided. The police send pizzas whose boxes have hidden listening devices. The bugs pick up someone speaking [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (initially misunderstood to be Russian), which is later identified as propaganda recordings of the late Albanian leader [[Enver Hoxha]], implying that the robbers anticipated the attempted surveillance.

When Arthur Case, the bank's founder and chairman, learns about the holdup, he hires [[Fixer (person)|fixer]] Madeleine White to try to protect the contents of a [[safe deposit box]] within the bank. Russell breaks into a safe deposit box and finds, among other things, documents from [[Nazi Germany]]. White, using her influence with the Mayor of New York, is introduced to Frazier and persuades him to let her talk to Russell, who agrees to allow her inside the bank so they can talk privately. Russell implies that Case started his bank with money he received [[Collaboration with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy|for collaborating with the Nazis]], resulting in many Jews dying during [[World War II]].

Frazier demands to inspect the hostages before allowing the robbers to leave and Russell shows him around the bank. As he is being shown out, Frazier attacks Russell, but is restrained by another robber. Afterwards, Frazier explains he deliberately provoked him, concluding that Russell is not a killer. However, Frazier's conclusion is almost immediately tested when a hostage execution is staged. The execution prompts an [[New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit|Emergency Services Unit]] team into action. They plan to storm the bank, using [[rubber bullet]]s to knock out those inside. Frazier discovers that the robbers have planted a listening device on the police; aware of the police plans, the robbers detonate smoke grenades and exit the bank hidden among the hostages.

The police detain and question everyone but cannot distinguish the identically dressed hostages from the robbers. A search of the bank reveals the robbers' weapons were plastic replicas. They find props showing that the hostage execution was faked, and no money or valuables appear to have been stolen. Unable to identify the suspects and unable to show a robbery has even been committed, Frazier's superior orders him to drop the case. Frazier, however, searches bank records and finds that safe deposit box No. 392 has never appeared on any records since the bank's founding in 1948. He obtains a search warrant to open it. White then confronts Frazier to persuade him to drop his investigation and during their conversation she hints at Case's Nazi dealings.  Frazier refuses to stop his investigation and plays a recording he had surreptitiously made of an incriminating conversation that took place earlier between White and Frazier and the mayor. White confronts Case, who admits the box contained loose diamonds and a [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]] diamond ring he took from a Jewish friend whom he betrayed to the Nazis.

Russell's opening monologue is revealed to have happened while he hid behind a fake wall the robbers had constructed inside the bank's supply room. He emerges a week after the robbery with the contents of Case's safe deposit box, including incriminating documents and several bags of diamonds. On his way out, he bumps into Frazier, who does not recognize him. Russell exits the bank and enters a waiting car filled with his conspirators, some of whom the police had questioned. When Frazier opens the safe deposit box, he finds the ring and a note from Russell that says, ""follow the ring"". He confronts Case, urging White to contact the [[Office of War Crimes Issues]] at the State Department about Case's war crimes. At home, Frazier finds a loose diamond and realizes that Russell slipped it into his pocket during their collision while exiting the bank.","Crime, Drama, Mystery","starring         = {{plainlist|

<!-- WP:FILMPLOT recommends the plot summary to be between 400-700 words. -->
In [[Dorchester, Boston]], [[Private investigator|P.I.]] Patrick Kenzie and his partner and girlfriend Angie Gennaro witness a televised plea by Helene McCready for the return of her abducted four-year-old daughter Amanda, whose favorite doll is Mirabelle. Amid the media frenzy, Amanda's aunt Bea and uncle Lionel hire the detectives to find her.

Patrick and Angie meet with [[Boston Police Department|police]] [[detectives]] Remy Bressant and Nick Poole who tell them about Corwin Earle, a known [[child molester]] who they consider a suspect. Patrick asks a criminal associate, Bubba, to look for him and also discovers that Helene and her boyfriend Ray are addicts and [[Mule (smuggling)|drug mules]] for local [[Haitians|Haitian]] [[drug lord]] Cheese, and had recently stolen $130,000 from him. After finding Ray has been murdered by Cheese's men, Patrick and Angie join Remy and Nick to find Amanda, whom they now believe has been taken by Cheese. Helene reveals she buried the money in Ray’s backyard and tearfully makes Patrick promise he will bring Amanda home alive.

Patrick meets with Cheese and tries to negotiate returning the stolen money in exchange for Amanda, but he denies any involvement in the girl's disappearance. The following day, Captain Jack Doyle reads Patrick a telephone transcript of Cheese calling the station to set up an exchange for the girl.

The exchange at a nearby [[Quincy Quarries Reservation|quarry]] is botched after a gunfight breaks out, and Cheese is killed. It is believed that Amanda fell into the quarry's pond and drowned; Angie retrieves her doll and returns it to Helene. Doyle, whose own daughter was killed years before, goes into early retirement soon afterwards.

Two months later, a seven-year-old boy is abducted in [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]], and Patrick receives information from Bubba that Corwin Earle is living with two married [[cocaine]] addicts. The two visit the house and Patrick observes evidence of the abducted boy, so returns with Remy and Nick late at night to rescue him.

Before they can enter the house, the woman starts shooting and fatally wounds Nick before chasing Patrick into Corwin's room. He discovers the dead child, executes Corwin as Remy arrives and then kills the woman. The following evening, an intoxicated Remy tries to alleviate Patrick's guilt, confiding that he once planted evidence on an abusive husband to help the man's family escape with Ray's help. Patrick recalls that previously Remy had told him he didn't know Ray.

Following Nick's funeral, Patrick speaks to police officer Devin, telling him that Remy lied to him about knowing Ray. Devin tells him Remy and Doyle knew about Cheese's stolen money before Cheese did. Patrick goads Lionel into meeting him in a bar and pieces together that he and Remy had staged a fake kidnapping to keep the drug money for themselves and to teach Helene a lesson, which Lionel finally admits.

Remy enters the bar wearing a mask, staging a robbery to interrupt their conversation. Patrick realizes that he plans to kill them so he yells loudly that Remy kidnapped Amanda. The bartender shoots him, he flees, pursued by Patrick, but succumbs to his wounds.

Patrick is questioned by the police and realizes Doyle is involved when he learns that the police don't use phone transcripts. Arriving at Doyle's, Patrick and Angie find Amanda alive and well. He admits he was part of the kidnapping and helped set up the fake exchange to frame Cheese. When Patrick threatens to call the authorities, Doyle tries to convince him that Amanda will have a better life with him than with her neglectful mother.

Patrick discusses the choice with Angie, who says she will hate him if he returns Amanda to her mother, making the case that the girl will grow up much more safely and happily if they leave her to be raised by Doyle. However, he calls the police regardless, as he'd promised Helene and believes she belongs with her, regardless of her bad parenting. Doyle and Lionel are arrested, and Patrick and Angie break up.

Patrick later visits Helene as she is preparing for a date. Learning she has not arranged for a babysitter, he volunteers. After she leaves, Patrick sits down and asks Amanda about her doll, Mirabelle, but she says its name is Anabelle. They then sit in silence watching TV, with Patrick realizing Helene didn't even know her daughter's favorite doll's name, wondering if he had made a mistake bringing her back to this toxic household.","Crime, Drama, Mystery","starring       = {{ubl|[[Casey Affleck]]|[[Michelle Monaghan]]|[[Morgan Freeman]]|[[Ed Harris]]|[[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]]|[[Amy Ryan]]|[[Amy Madigan]]|[[Titus Welliver]]}}

Recently retired Irish tennis professional Chris Wilton is taken on as an instructor at an upmarket club in [[London]]. There, he strikes up a friendship with wealthy pupil Tom Hewett. Tom's sister Chloe is smitten with Chris, and they begin dating. During a family gathering, Chris meets Tom's American fiancée Nola Rice, and they become attracted to each other.

Chloe persuades her father, Alec, to give Chris a job as an executive in one of his companies. After this, Chris begins to be accepted into the family.

One afternoon, Tom's mother, Eleanor, questions Nola's choice of profession. Furious, Nola leaves the house during a thunderstorm. Chris follows Nola and confesses his feelings for her, and they have sex in a wheat field. Feeling guilty, Nola treats this as an accident. Chris, however, wants an ongoing affair. Chris and Chloe marry, while Tom ends his relationship with Nola.

Chloe, to her distress, does not become pregnant immediately. Chris tries to track down Nola but later meets her by chance at [[Tate Modern]]. He asks for her number, and they begin an affair.

While Chris spends time with his wife's family, Nola calls to inform him that she is pregnant. Panicked, he asks her to get an abortion, but she refuses, saying she wants to raise the child with him. Chris becomes distant from Chloe. She suspects Chris is having an affair, which he denies. Nola urges him to divorce his wife; he feels trapped and finds himself lying to Chloe as well as to Nola. Nola confronts him outside his apartment and he barely escapes public detection.

Soon afterwards, Chris takes a shotgun from his father-in-law's and brings it to his office in a tennis bag. After leaving the office, he calls Nola on her mobile to tell her he has good news. He goes to her building and gains entry into the apartment of her neighbor, Mrs. Eastby, whom he shoots and kills, staging a [[burglary]] by ransacking the rooms and stealing jewelry and drugs. As Nola returns, Chris shoots her in the stairwell, then takes a taxi to the theater to watch a musical with Chloe. [[Scotland Yard]] concludes the crime was likely committed by a drug addict stealing money. The following day, as the murder is in the news, Chris returns the shotgun and he and Chloe announce that she is pregnant.

Detective Mike Banner invites Chris for an interview concerning the murder. Before he goes to see the detectives, he throws Mrs. Eastby's jewelry and drugs into the river, but by chance, her ring bounces on the railing and falls to the pavement.

At the police station, Chris lies about his relationship with Nola, but Banner surprises him with her diary, in which he is featured extensively. He confesses his affair but denies any link to the murder. Chris appeals to the detectives not to involve him further in their investigation as news of the affair may end his marriage just as he and his wife are expecting a baby.

One night, Chris sees apparitions of Nola and Mrs. Eastby, who tell him to be ready for the consequences of his actions. He replies that his crimes, though wrong, were committed for a ""grander scheme"", and that he can suppress his guilt. The same night, Banner dreams that Chris committed the murders. The next morning, however, Banner's theory is discredited by his partner, Dowd, who reveals a drug addict found murdered on the streets had Eastby's ring in his pocket. The detectives consider the case closed and abandon any further investigation. Chloe gives birth to a baby boy named Terence, and his uncle Tom blesses him not with greatness but with luck.","Drama, Romance, Thriller","starring = {{Plainlist|<!-- in the order of the poster -->

'''''Match Point''''' is a 2005 [[psychological thriller]] film written and directed by [[Woody Allen]], and starring [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Emily Mortimer]], [[Matthew Goode]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], and [[Penelope Wilton]]. In the film, Rhys Meyers' character, a former professional tennis player, marries into a wealthy family, but his social position is threatened by his affair with his brother-in-law's girlfriend, played by Scarlett Johansson. The film deals with themes of morality and greed, and explores the roles of lust, money, and luck in life, leading many to compare it to Allen's earlier film ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'' (1989). It was produced and filmed in London after Allen had difficulty finding financial support for the film in New York. The agreement obliged him to make it there using a cast and crew mostly from the United Kingdom. Allen quickly re-wrote the script, which was originally set in New York, for an English setting.

Critics in the United States praised the film and its English setting and welcomed it as a return to form for Allen. In contrast, reviewers from the United Kingdom treated ''Match Point'' less favorably, finding fault with the locations and especially the British idiom in the dialogues. Allen was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]].

932,Lord of War,"==Plot==
Yuri Orlov, the eldest son of a family of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] refugees is visiting a restaurant in [[Brighton Beach, Brooklyn|Brighton Beach]] where he witnesses a Russian mobster kill two assassins holding [[Kalashnikov rifle]]s. The incident inspires him to go into the arms trade. After meeting a contact at his temple and completing his first sale of an [[Uzi]] sub-machine gun to a local mobster, Yuri convinces his younger brother Vitaly to become his partner.

The two brothers get their first break during the [[1982 Lebanon War]], where they sell weapons to both [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli]] and [[Lebanese Armed Forces|Lebanese]] troops despite seeing the weapons used to commit atrocities. As Yuri prospers, he eventually catches the attention of [[Interpol]] agent Jack Valentine. Valentine represents a unique threat to Yuri because he is after recognition, not money, and cannot be bribed. Vitaly becomes addicted to cocaine after a [[Colombia]]n drug lord forces the brothers to accept several kilos of cocaine as payment. Yuri checks Vitaly into a drug rehabilitation clinic and continues alone. He uses his profits to seduce and marry his favorite model, Ava Fontaine.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yuri flies to [[Ukraine]] and illegally buys Soviet military hardware through his uncle, a former Soviet general who is overseeing the distribution of weapons to the newly formed [[Ukrainian Ground Forces|Ukrainian Army]]. His uncle dies in a car bombing by Yuri's rival, arms dealer Simeon Weisz. Yuri expands his business to Africa, where he supplies Andre Baptiste, a bloody [[Liberia]]n dictator. After a successful arms deal, Baptiste captures Weisz and offers Yuri a chance to execute him. Yuri refuses, but Baptiste places the gun into his hand and pulls the trigger.

Valentine tells Ava that her husband is an arms dealer, prompting her to confront him. In response, Yuri starts trading timber and oil, but becomes frustrated with the lower profits of honest work. When Baptiste visits him in person and offers him the largest payday of his career, a stash of valuable [[blood diamond]]s, Yuri returns to crime. Ava follows him one day, unaware that Interpol is following her, and she discovers the shipping container that holds his arms-dealing office.

Yuri picks up Vitaly to assist him with a deal in [[Sierra Leone]], where a militia force allied with Baptiste is preparing to destroy a refugee camp. Vitaly pleads with Yuri to abandon the deal after witnessing Baptiste's men kill a woman and child with machetes, but Yuri refuses, knowing that Baptiste's men would kill them. In response, Vitaly steals a pair of grenades and destroys a truck full of weapons, also killing Baptiste's son, before he is gunned down. Yuri is spared and receives half his payment for the remaining truckload. He pays a doctor to forge Vitaly's death certificate and remove the bullets from his body, but a missed bullet is found by customs officials, and Yuri is arrested. Ava divorces Yuri, and his parents disown him.

Valentine detains Yuri in anticipation of his trial and conviction, but Yuri is unfazed, telling Valentine that a high-ranking officer will shortly knock on the door and insist on his release. He explains that while he is a criminal, his crime sometimes serves the interests of the U.S. government by arming the political rivals of their enemies, who the government cannot be publicly affiliated with. A disillusioned Valentine hears a knock at the door as Yuri predicted, looks at Yuri for a moment, and rebukes him.

Yuri is released and soon returns to the arms trade. The film concludes with a statement that the five largest arms producers in the world—the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Russia]], [[China]], and [[France]]—are also the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]].","Action, Crime, Drama","starring       = {{plainlist|

Theater director Caden [[Cotard's syndrome|Cotard]] finds his life unraveling. He suffers from numerous physical ailments and has been growing increasingly alienated from his artist wife, Adele. He hits bottom when Adele leaves him for a new life in [[Berlin]], taking their four-year-old daughter, Olive, with her.

After the success of his production of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', Caden unexpectedly receives a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]], giving him the financial means to pursue his artistic interests. He determines to use it to create an artistic piece of brutal realism and honesty, into which he can pour his whole self. Gathering an [[ensemble cast]] into an enormous warehouse in Manhattan's [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]], he directs a celebration of the mundane, instructing the cast to live out their constructed lives. As the mockup inside the warehouse grows increasingly [[Mimesis|mimetic]] of the city outside, Caden continues to seek solutions to his personal crises. He is traumatized as he discovers Adele has become a celebrated painter in Berlin and Olive is growing up under the questionable guidance of Adele's friend Maria. After a failed attempt at a fling with Hazel (the woman who works in the box office), he marries Claire, an actress in his cast, and has a daughter with her. Their relationship fails, and he continues his awkward relationship with Hazel, who is now married with children and working as his assistant. Meanwhile, an unknown condition is systematically shutting down his [[autonomic nervous system]].

As the years rapidly pass, the continually expanding warehouse is isolated from the deterioration of the city outside. Caden buries himself ever deeper into his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], blurring the line between reality and the world of the play by populating the cast and crew with [[doppelgänger]]s. For instance, Sammy Barnathan is cast in the role of Caden in the play after Sammy reveals that he has been obsessively following Caden for 20 years, while Sammy's lookalike is cast as Sammy. Sammy's interest in Hazel sparks a revival of Caden's relationship with her, leading Sammy to commit suicide. Shortly after Caden and Hazel finally get together, Hazel dies of smoke inhalation in her constantly burning house.

As he pushes against the limits of his personal and professional relationships, Caden lets an actress take over his role as director and takes on her previous role as Ellen, Adele's custodian. He lives out his days in the model of Adele's apartment under the replacement director's instruction while some unexplained calamity occurs in the warehouse leaving ruins and bodies in its wake. Finally, he prepares for death as he rests his head on the shoulder of an actress who had previously played Ellen's mother, seemingly the only person in the warehouse still alive. As the scene fades to gray, Caden begins to say that now he has an idea of how to do the play, when the director's voice in his ear cuts him off with his final cue: ""Die.""",Drama,"starring       = {{Plain list |

Two eight-year-old [[Little League]] teammates, Neil McCormick and Brian Lackey, both experience life-altering events during the summer of 1981 in [[Hutchinson, Kansas|Hutchinson]], [[Kansas]]. Neil, the son of an irresponsible single mother and already discovering his own homosexuality, is [[Child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] by the Little League coach, who leaves town after that summer. Brian, whose parents are often neglectful or busy working, only remembers that it started to rain during a game. The next thing he remembers is being in the crawl space of his house with a bloody nose, having no memory of the intervening five hours.

Neil views the coach's abuse as love, and develops an attraction to older men. He begins working as a prostitute at the age of 15, and continues doing so three years later when he moves to New York City, where his best friend, Wendy Peterson, now lives. In New York, Neil has an emotional encounter with a client, Zeke, who is dying from AIDS and only wants to have gay sex one last time. Afterward, Neil begins withdrawing from protitution and takes a job at a sandwich shop with assistance and encouragement from Wendy.

Brian suffers from chronic nosebleeds, blackouts, and bedwetting for years after being in the crawl space. He also has [[recurring dream]]s about being touched by a strange, bluish hand, which eventually leads Brian to suspect he may have been [[Abduction phenomenon|abducted by aliens]]. Another boy wearing the same Little League uniform begins to appear in these dreams later on. At 18, Brian meets a woman named Avalyn Friesen, who also believes she was abducted by aliens. They start to form a friendship, but when she makes sexual advances toward him, he panics and refuses to speak to her again due to his homossexuality.

Brian sees a photo of his Little League team as he tries to untangle his confused memories, recognizing a young Neil as the other boy from his dreams. Meanwhile, after a client brutally rapes and beats him, he returns to Hutchinson to spend Christmas with his mother. There, Neil and Brian meet for the first time in over a decade. After breaking into the house that was previously rented by the Little League coach, Neil tells Brian what happened that night: the coach offered to drive Brian home with Neil after a baseball game was rained out, as Brian did not have a ride. Instead, they all went to the coach's house, where the coach performed sex acts on the boys and made them perform sex acts on each other. At one point, Brian collapsed face-first onto the floor, giving him a bloody nose, while a porch light caused the atmosphere to have an eerie blue color.

Finbar McBride, a quiet, unmarried man with [[dwarfism]], deeply loves railroads and leads a solitary existence. He works in a [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], [[Rail transport modeling|model train]] hobby shop owned by his elderly and similarly taciturn friend Henry. He keeps to himself and is uncomfortable when people react to his size.

When Henry dies, Fin learns that the hobby shop is to be closed and that Henry has bequeathed him a rural property with an abandoned train depot on it. He moves into the old building hoping for a life of solitude but becomes reluctantly enmeshed in the lives of his neighbors. [[Cuban American]] Joe Oramas operates his father's roadside snack truck while the elder man recovers from an illness, and artist Olivia Harris is trying to cope with the sudden death of her young son two years earlier and its ramifications on her marriage to David, from whom she is separated.

Joe, relentlessly upbeat and talkative, cracks Fin's reserve. The two take daily walks along the tracks, and after Olivia gives Fin a movie camera, Joe drives alongside a passing train so that Fin can film it. Joe and Fin sleep at Olivia's house after watching the footage and the next morning, meet a flustered, unannounced David. The trio's tentative friendship is threatened when Olivia descends into a deep [[major depressive disorder|depression]] and disappears. Emily seeks solace in Fin, who realizes human interaction may not be wholly unpleasant. When Fin tries to protect Emily from her boyfriend at a bar he pushes Fin aside, causing Fin to lapse back into his [[asocial]] behavior. He gets frustrated with Joe and tells him he just wants to be left alone, which hurts Joe's feelings. Emily comes to apologize for the trouble earlier, and after she and Fin share a kiss, she spends the night with Fin after asking if she can ""just sleep"" there. Cleo asks Fin if Olivia is coming back; he replies that he doesn't know. Keeping an eye on Olivia's house, he sees her arguing on the phone with David and goes onto her porch.

The story is told in a [[Nonlinear narrative|nonlinear]] manner. The following is a chronological summary of the plot:

Jack Jordan is a former convict who is using his new-found religious faith to recover from drug addiction and alcoholism. Paul Rivers is a [[mathematics]] professor with a dedicated wife, Mary, and has a  fatal heart condition. Unless he receives a new heart from an organ donor, he will not live longer than a month. Mary wants him to donate his sperm so she can have his baby even if he dies. Cristina Peck is a recovering drug addict and now lives a normal suburban life with a supportive husband and two children. She is a loving mother and active swimmer who has left behind her days of drugs and alcohol. These three separate stories/characters become tied together one evening when Jack kills Cristina's husband and children in a [[hit-and-run]] accident. Cristina's husband's heart is donated to Paul, who begins his recovery.

Cristina is devastated by the loss and returns to drugs and alcohol. Paul is eager to begin normal life again, but he hesitantly agrees to his wife's idea of artificial insemination as a last-ditch effort to get pregnant. During consultations with a doctor before the procedure, Paul learns about an [[abortion]] that Mary had undergone after they had separated in the past. Angered, Paul ends the relationship. He becomes very inquisitive about whose heart he has. He learns from a private detective that the heart belonged to Cristina's husband and begins to follow the widowed Cristina around town.

Jack is stricken with guilt following the accident and starts using drugs again. Despite his wife's protests to keep quiet and conceal his guilt, Jack tells her that his ""duty is to God"" and turns himself in. While incarcerated, he clashes verbally with a pastor who had helped him after his last incarceration, claims that God had betrayed him, loses his will to live, and attempts suicide. He is released after Cristina declines to press charges against him, as she realizes that incarcerating Jack will not bring her family back. When Jack is released, he is unable to reincorporate himself into normal family life, and instead leaves home to live as a transient, working as a manual laborer.

Paul finds an opportunity to meet Cristina and eventually reveals how the two of them are connected. She is initially furious and forces him out, but soon reconsiders. Desperately needing each other, they continue their relationship. Though Paul has a new heart, his body is [[Transplant rejection|rejecting the transplant]] and his outlook is grim. As Cristina begins to dwell more on her changed life and the death of her family, she becomes obsessed with taking revenge against Jack. She goads Paul into agreeing to murder him.

Paul meets with the private detective who had found Cristina for him. The detective tells Paul that Jack is living in a motel and sells Paul a gun. Paul and Cristina check into the motel where Jack is staying. When Jack is walking alone, Paul grabs him and leads him out into a clearing at gunpoint intending to kill him. However, Paul is unable to kill Jack, who himself is confused, shaking and pleading during the event. Paul fires three shots into the ground and tells Jack to ""just disappear,"" then returns to the motel and lies to Cristina about Jack's death. Later that night, while they are sleeping, Paul and Cristina are awakened by a noise outside their door. It's Jack, who, still consumed by guilt, orders Paul to actually kill him and end his misery. A struggle ensues, during which Cristina blind-sides Jack and starts beating him with a wooden lamp. Paul collapses, gets hold of the gun, and accidentally shoots himself.

Jack and Cristina rush Paul to the hospital. Still believing he deserves to be punished for his hit-and-run, Jack tells the police that he was the one who shot Paul, but is released when his story cannot be confirmed. Paul dies, and the conflict between Cristina and Jack remains unresolved (they meet in the waiting room after Paul's death; if they have a conversation, it is not shown). When Cristina offers to donate blood for Paul in the hospital, she learns that she is pregnant; the doctor urges Cristina to quit using drugs. After Paul's death, Cristina is seen tentatively preparing for the new child in one of her daughter's bedrooms, which she had previously been unable to enter after her daughter's death. Jack is shown returning to his family.","Crime, Drama, Thriller","starring       = [[Sean Penn]]<br />[[Naomi Watts]]<br />[[Benicio del Toro]]<br /> [[Melissa Leo]]<br />[[Charlotte Gainsbourg]]

The film opens with multiple shots of the [[Tribute in Light]] floodlights reaching into the sky from the site of the [[World_Trade_Center_(1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], which was destroyed in the 9/11 attacks. 

A car pulls up at night on a [[New York City]] street. Two men get out, Monty Brogan and his friend Kostya, to look at an injured dog lying in the road. Monty intends to perform a [[Coup de grâce|mercy kill]] and shoot the dog but changes his mind after looking it in the eye; instead he takes the dog to a nearby clinic for treatment.

A few years later, Monty is about to begin serving a seven-year prison sentence for dealing drugs. He sits in a park with Doyle, the dog he rescued, after walking all over the city on his last day of freedom. He has passed American flags, fire station memorials, and tattered posters, reminders of those lost in the 9/11 attack. He plans to meet childhood friends later at a club with his girlfriend Naturelle. These are Frank, a boorish [[Wall Street]] trader, and Jacob, an introverted high school teacher with a crush on one of his students, named Mary.

Monty visits his father, James, a former firefighter and recovering alcoholic at his bar, to confirm their plans to drive to the prison the following morning. Monty gave drug money to his father to open the bar; James remorsefully sneaks a drink when Monty goes to the restroom. Facing himself in the mirror, Monty lashes out in his mind against everyone in New York before finally turning on himself, angry for becoming greedy and not giving up drug dealing before he was caught.

In a flashback, Monty remembers the night he was arrested: [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents raided Monty's apartment and quickly found the drugs he was selling for Uncle Nikolai, a Russian mobster. Kostya tries to persuade Monty it was Naturelle who betrayed him, since she knew where he hid his drugs and money. Monty refused to [[turn state's evidence]] against Nikolai, but is unsure about Nikolai’s actions. Monty remembers how he met Naturelle when he was hanging around his old school, and how happy they were. He asks Frank to find out if it was Naturelle who betrayed him.

Jacob sees Mary outside the club, and Monty invites her inside with them, although she is underage. Discussing what kind of a future Monty can have after prison, Frank says they can open a bar together. (He had told Jacob that he believes Monty deserves his sentence for dealing drugs.) Frank accuses Naturelle of living high on Monty's money despite knowing its origins, but she retorts that Frank also knew but said nothing. The argument culminates with Frank insulting Naturelle's Puerto Rican ethnicity; she slaps him and leaves. Jacob, meanwhile, finds the courage to kiss Mary, but both are shocked afterward and go their separate ways.

Monty and Kostya go to see Nikolai, who gives Monty advice on surviving in prison. Nikolai says that it was Kostya who betrayed Monty, and offers him a chance to kill Kostya in exchange for protecting his father's bar. Monty refuses, reminding Nikolai that the mobster was the one who told Monty to trust Kostya in the first place. Monty walks out, leaving Kostya to be killed by the Russian mobsters.

Monty returns to his apartment and apologizes to Naturelle for mistrusting her. He hands Doyle over to Jacob in the park. He admits that he is terrified of being raped in prison, whereupon he asks Frank to beat him, believing that he might have a chance at survival if he enters the prison ugly.

<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. -->
 <!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 to 700 words. -->
Growing up, Evan Treborn, his friends Lenny Kagan and Kayleigh Miller, and Kayleigh's brother Tommy suffered many severe [[psychological trauma]]s that caused Evan to experience frequent [[amnesia]]. These traumas include being forced to create [[child pornography]] by Kayleigh and Tommy's father George, Evan nearly being strangled to death by his institutionalized father Jason before Jason is killed in front of him by guards, accidentally killing a mother and her infant daughter while playing with [[dynamite]], and Tommy burning Evan's dog Crockett alive. Evan keeps meticulous journals of his day to day life as a coping mechanism.

Some time later, while entertaining a girl in his college dorm room, Evan discovers that he can time travel and redo parts of his past by reading his journals; his time-traveling episodes account for the frequent blackouts he experienced, since those are the moments when his older self occupied his consciousness.

After a traumatized Kayleigh commits suicide, Evan travels back in time and prevents George from molesting her. He comes back to a reality where he and Kayleigh are a happy couple in college, but discovers George ended up taking out all of his abusive tendencies on Tommy, who grew up to become even more violent and dangerous. When Evan is attacked by Tommy, he kills Tommy in self defense and is imprisoned. There, he manages to time travel once more after his mother brings him a journal during a visit.

Upon returning, Evan stops Tommy from killing Crockett, but Lenny, relentlessly bullied by Tommy and mentally unstable following the dynamite incident, kills Tommy with a metal shard. Following Tommy’s death, Evan wakes up in a new reality where Lenny has been institutionalized and Kayleigh is a drug-addicted prostitute. Evan travels back to prevent the dynamite accident; while Tommy shields the mother and baby from the blast, Evan is caught directly in the explosion.

In the new reality, Lenny and Kayleigh are happily in a relationship and Tommy has become religious, but Evan is a double amputee. His mother, stricken with grief over her son's injuries, began smoking obsessively and developed lung cancer. To save his mother and himself from this fate, Evan goes back to his childhood and prepares to discard the lit dynamite, but Kayleigh picks it up when it is smacked out of his hand by her father, and it explodes, killing her.

Evan awakens in a mental hospital and finds that his journals no longer exist and he has suffered irreversible brain damage due to the rigors of time travel. He discovers that his father had the same ability before losing the photographs that allowed him to time travel. Evan ultimately reasons that he and his friends will never have good futures as long as he keeps altering the past.

After escaping the hospital staff and barricading himself in an office, Evan uses an old home movie to travel back to the day he first met Kayleigh. He intentionally upsets her so that she and Tommy choose to live with their mother rather than their father in the wake of their parents' divorce. As a result, the siblings are not subjected to a destructive upbringing, and Lenny is never bullied.

Evan awakens in a college dorm room, where Lenny is his roommate. To ensure that his plan worked, he asks where Kayleigh is; Lenny does not know who Evan is referring to. Satisfied that his friends' futures are secure, Evan burns his journals and videos to avoid altering the past ever again.

Eight years later, in [[New York City]], Evan and Kayleigh pass each other on the street, briefly look at each other, and continue walking.

===Director's cut===
The [[director's cut]] features a different ending. With his brain terribly damaged and aware that he is committed to a psychiatric facility where he will lose access to his time travel ability, Evan makes a desperate attempt to change the timeline by watching a family video, which shows his mother just before she was about to give birth to Evan. Evan travels back to that moment and strangles himself in the womb with his [[umbilical cord]] so as to prevent the multi-[[generational curse]] from continuing, consistent with an added scene where a psychic palm reader tells Evan ""you have no lifeline"" and that he does ""not belong to this world"". Kayleigh is then seen as a child in the new timeline having chosen to live with her mother instead of her father, and a montage suggests that the lives of the other childhood characters have become loving and less tragic.","Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist|

946,The Royal Tenenbaums,"== Plot ==
Royal Tenenbaum explains to his three adolescent children, Chas, Margot, and Richie, that he and his wife, Etheline, are separating. Each of the children achieved great success at a young age. Chas is a math and business genius, from whom Royal steals money. Margot, who was adopted, was awarded a grant for a play that she wrote in the ninth grade. Richie is a [[tennis]] [[child prodigy|prodigy]] and artist who expresses his love for Margot. Eli Cash is the Tenenbaums' neighbor and Richie's best friend. Also part of the Tenenbaum household is Pagoda, the trusted valet.

Twenty-two years later, Royal is kicked out of the hotel where he has been living. The children are in a post-success slump, with Richie traveling the world on a [[cruise ship]], following a breakdown. He writes to Eli revealing his romantic love for Margot. Chas has become overprotective of his sons, Ari and Uzi, following his wife Rachael's death in a plane crash. Margot is married to [[neurologist]] Raleigh St. Clair, from whom she hides her smoking and her checkered past. Raleigh is conducting research on a subject named Dudley Heinsbergen, and diagnoses Dudley with Heinsbergen Syndrome. 

Etheline's longtime accountant, Henry Sherman, proposes to her. Learning of Henry's proposal via Pagoda, Royal claims that he has [[stomach cancer]] to win back his wife's and children's affections. Etheline calls her children home, and Royal moves back in and sets up medical equipment in Richie's room. Royal learns of Chas' overprotective nature and takes his grandsons on an adventure involving [[shoplifting]] and [[dog fighting]]. On their return, Chas berates him for endangering his boys while Royal accuses Chas of having a [[nervous breakdown]].

Eli, with whom Margot has been having an affair, tells her that Richie told him he loves her. Royal discovers the affair and objects to Margot's treatment of Raleigh, who confides to Richie his suspicions of Margot having an affair. He and Richie hire a [[private investigator]] to surveil her. Meanwhile, Henry investigates Royal's cancer claim and discovers his hospital had closed, his doctor does not exist, and that his cancer medication is only [[Tic Tac|Tic Tacs]]. He confronts Pagoda, Royal's partner in the scheme, and gathers the family to tell them that Royal has been lying about his illness. Afterwards, Royal and Pagoda are kicked out from the family home and into a gypsy cab.

Richie and Raleigh get the private eye's report on Margot, which reveals her history of smoking and sexual promiscuity, including a previous marriage to a [[Jamaican people|Jamaican]] recording artist. Both men take the news hard, with Richie going into a bathroom, shaving off his hair and beard, and slashing his wrists in an attempt at suicide. Dudley finds Richie and Raleigh rushes him to hospital. As the Tenenbaums sit in the waiting room, Raleigh confronts Margot about her past, reveals that he knows she smokes, and then leaves. Richie checks himself out of the hospital and meets with Margot in his childhood tent to confess his love. They quietly cherish their mutual, secret love and they kiss.

Royal decides that he wants Etheline to be happy, and finally files for a divorce. Before Henry and Etheline's wedding, Eli, high on [[mescaline]], crashes his car into the side of the house. Royal rescues Ari and Uzi just in time, but the boys' dog, Buckley, is killed in the collision. Enraged, Chas chases Eli through the house and tosses him into the neighbor's yard. Eli and Chas agree that they both need help. Chas thanks Royal for saving his sons and for buying them a [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] named Sparkplug from the responding firemen as a replacement for Buckley. Forty-eight hours later, Etheline and Henry are married in a [[judge's chambers]].

Some time later, Margot releases a new play inspired by her family and past events, Raleigh publishes a book about Dudley's condition, Eli checks himself into a drug rehabilitation facility in [[North Dakota]], and Richie begins teaching a junior tennis program. Chas becomes less overprotective of his sons, and Royal seems to have improved his relationship with all his children, and looks to be on better terms with Etheline. He has a [[heart attack]] and dies at the age of 68. Chas accompanies him in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, and is the only witness to his death. The family attends his funeral, where the [[epitaph]] (which he wrote beforehand) reads that he ""Died tragically rescuing his family from the wreckage of a destroyed sinking battleship.""","Comedy, Drama","starring       = {{ubl|[[Danny Glover]]|[[Gene Hackman]]|[[Anjelica Huston]]|[[Bill Murray]]|[[Gwyneth Paltrow]]|[[Ben Stiller]]|[[Luke Wilson]]|Owen Wilson}} <!-- per the poster -->

951,Enemy at the Gates,"== Plot ==
[[Vasily Zaitsev (sniper)|Vassili Zaitsev]], a soldier in the [[Red Army]], is sent to the frontline of the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1942. Forced into a suicidal charge without a rifle but with ammunition, he hides among a pile of corpses, while a tank shell incapacitates a car. The occupant, [[Political commissar in the Soviet Union|Commissar]] Danilov, takes cover in the same heap of corpses and finds a rifle. Vassili reveals himself, advising the commissar not to fire until an explosion covers the noise. Danilov gives the rifle to Vassili, who, to the former's astonishment, is able to kill five German soldiers in less than a minute.

[[Nikita Khrushchev]] demands ideas from his subordinates to improve morale. While the other commissars suggest more severe discipline and terror, Danilov, now a senior lieutenant, recommends giving the troops inspiration. He suggests they should ""make examples, but examples to follow,"" and recommends Zaitsev for that role. Soon after, Danilov begins publishing heroic tales of Vassili's exploits in the army's newspaper. Vassili is transferred to the [[sniper]] division and becomes friends with Danilov. Both also become romantically interested in [[Tania Chernova]], a private in the local militia. In fear for her safety, Danilov has her transferred to an intelligence unit, ostensibly to make use of her [[German language|German]] skills in translating radio intercepts.

With the Soviet snipers taking an increasing toll on the German forces, German Major [[Erwin König]] is deployed to kill Vassili and crush Soviet morale. When the Red Army command learns of König's mission after he wipes out Vassili's sniper unit, they dispatch König's former student Koulikov to help Vassili kill him. König, however, outmaneuvers Koulikov and kills him, shaking Vassili's spirits. Danilov finds a boy, [[Sasha Filippov|Sacha Filipov]], who volunteers to act as a [[double agent]] by passing König false information about Vassili's whereabouts in exchange for food. Vassili sets a trap for König and manages to wound him with the help of Tania. During a second attempt, Vassili falls asleep, and his sniper log is stolen by a looting German soldier. The German command takes the log as evidence of Vassili's death and plans to send König home, but König does not believe that Vassili is dead.

General [[Friedrich Paulus]] confiscates König's dog tags to prevent Soviet propaganda from profiting if König is killed and identified. In turn, König gives the general a [[War Merit Cross]] that was posthumously awarded to his son, a lieutenant in the [[116th Infantry Division (Germany)|116th Infantry Division]] who was killed in the early days of the battle. König tells Sacha where he will be next after deducing that the boy is responsible for his being wounded. Tania and Vassili have meanwhile fallen in love. That night, Tania secretly goes to the Soviet barracks and makes love with Vassili. The jealous Danilov disparages Vassili in a letter to his superiors.

König spots Tania and Vassili waiting for him at his next ambush spot, confirming his suspicions about Sacha. He then kills the boy and hangs his body to bait Vassili. Vassili vows to kill König and asks Tania and Danilov to evacuate Sacha's mother. Tania is wounded by shrapnel en route to the boats. Thinking she is dead, Danilov regrets his jealousy of Vassili and even his ardor for [[Communism|communist]] ideals begins to falter. Finding Vassili waiting to ambush König, Danilov puts on a helmet and exposes himself to provoke König into shooting him and revealing his own position. Thinking that he has killed Vassili, König goes to inspect the body only to find himself in the Russian's sights. Accepting his fate, König grimly turns to look Vassili in the face before being shot. Two months later, after Stalingrad has been liberated and German forces have surrendered, Vassili finds Tania recovering in a [[field hospital]].","Drama, History, War","starring       = {{plainlist |

965,Dead Man,"==Plot==
William Blake, an accountant from [[Cleveland]], Ohio, rides by train to the frontier [[company town]] of Machine to take up a promised accounting job in the town's metal works. During the trip, the train [[Fireman (steam engine)|fireman]] warns Blake against the enterprise. Arriving in town, Blake notes the hostility of the townsfolk towards him. He then discovers that the position has already been filled, and John Dickinson, the ferocious owner of the company, drives Blake from the workplace at gunpoint.

Jobless and without money or prospects, Blake meets Thel Russell, a former prostitute who sells paper flowers. He lets her take him home. Thel's ex-boyfriend Charlie surprises them in bed, shoots at Blake, and accidentally kills Thel when she shields Blake with her body. The bullet passes through Thel and wounds Blake, who kills Charlie with Thel's gun before climbing out the window and fleeing the town on Charlie's horse. Company owner Dickinson is Charlie's father and hires three killers — Cole Wilson, Conway Twill, and Johnny ""The Kid"" Pickett — to bring Blake back ""dead or alive"".

Blake awakens to find a large [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] man trying to dislodge the bullet from his chest. The man, calling himself Nobody, reveals that the bullet is too close to Blake's heart to remove, rendering Blake effectively a walking dead man. When he learns Blake's full name, Nobody decides Blake is a reincarnation of William Blake, a poet whom he idolizes but of whom Blake is ignorant.<ref>In [//www.nytrash.com/deadman/deadjj.html an interview] Jarmusch states ""For Nobody, the journey is a continuing ceremony whose purpose is to deliver Blake back to the spirit-level of the world. To him, Blake's spirit has been misplaced and somehow returned to the physical realm.""</ref> He decides to care for Blake and to use Native methods to help ease him into death.

Blake learns of Nobody's past, marked by prejudice from Euro-Americans who objected to his Indigenous ancestry, and equally from Native Americans who objected that his mother and father were from two opposing tribes, [[Piikáni]] and [[Apsáalooke]], respectively.<ref name=""taubin"">{{cite web |last1=Taubin |first1=Amy |date=May 4, 2018 |title=Dead Man: Blake in America |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/5619-dead-man-blake-in-america |access-date=May 9, 2022 |website=The Criterion Collection }}</ref> As a child, English soldiers abducted and brought him to Europe as a model savage. He was briefly educated before returning home, where his stories of the white man and his culture were laughed off by fellow Native Americans. They thus dub him Xebeche: ""He who talks loud, saying nothing"". Nobody resolves to escort Blake to the Pacific Ocean to return him to his proper place in the spirit world.

Blake and Nobody travel west, leaving a trail of dead and encountering [[wanted posters]] announcing growing bounties for Blake's death or capture. Nobody leaves Blake alone in the wild when he decides Blake must undergo a [[vision quest]]. On his quest, Blake kills two [[U.S. Marshal]]s, experiences visions of nature spirits, and grieves over the remains of a dead fawn his pursuers accidentally kill. He paints his face with the fawn's blood and rejoins Nobody. Meanwhile, the most ferocious member of the bounty hunter posse, Cole Wilson, has killed his comrades (eating one of them) and continued his hunt alone.

At a trading post, a bigoted missionary identifies Blake and attempts to kill him but instead dies at Blake's hands. Shortly after, Blake is shot again, and his condition rapidly deteriorates. Nobody hurries to take him by the river to a [[Makah]] village and persuades the tribe to give him a canoe for Blake's [[ship burial]]. Delirious, Blake trudges through the village, where the people pity him, before he collapses from his injuries.

He awakens in a canoe on a beach wearing a Native American funeral dress. Nobody bids Blake farewell and then pushes the canoe out to sea. As he floats away, Blake sees Cole approaching Nobody. Too weak to cry out, he can only watch as the two shoot and kill each other.

969,Falling Down,"==Plot==
William Foster is stuck in [[Los Angeles]] traffic on a hot day. After his air conditioning fails, he abandons his car and begins walking, carrying his briefcase.

At a convenience store, the Korean owner refuses to give change for a telephone call. Foster becomes agitated over the high prices. The owner grabs a baseball bat and demands Foster leave. Foster takes the bat and destroys several merchandise displays before leaving. Later, while resting on a hill, he is harassed by two Mexican gang members, who threaten him with a knife and demand his briefcase. Foster attacks them with the bat and takes their knife.

The gang members, now in a car with two associates, find Foster using a [[payphone]]. They open fire, killing four surrounding bystanders, but not Foster. The driver crashes. Foster picks up an [[UZI]] they had, shoots the one surviving gang member and then leaves with their bag of weapons. Foster encounters a [[panhandler]] who harasses him for change. Foster finally gives him the briefcase, which only contains his lunch.

At a fast food restaurant, Foster attempts to order breakfast, but is told they have switched to the lunch menu. After an argument with the manager, Foster pulls a gun and fires into the ceiling accidentally. After trying to reassure the frightened employees and customers, he orders lunch, but is annoyed when the burger looks nothing like the one on the menu. After Foster calls ""home"" again and states his intention to attend his daughter Adele's birthday party, his ex-wife Beth notifies the police because she has a [[restraining order]] against him.

Sergeant Martin Prendergast, who is on his last day of duty before being coaxed into retirement by his  wife, insists on investigating the events. Interviews with witnesses lead Prendergast to suspect that the same person is responsible for all of them. Foster's vanity license plate proves to be an important lead, because Prendergast remembers being in the same traffic jam as Foster earlier that day. Prendergast and his partner, Detective Sandra Torres, visit Foster's mother, who is surprised to learn that he lost his job. They realize Foster is heading toward his former family's home in [[Venice, California|Venice]] and rush to intercept him.

Foster passes a bank where a black man is protesting after being rejected for a loan. The man exchanges a glance with Foster and says, ""Don't forget me,"" as he is escorted away by police. Foster stops at a military [[surplus store]] to buy boots. The owner, a homophobic [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]], diverts Torres when she comes in. After Torres leaves, the owner offers Foster a [[rocket launcher]] and congratulates him for the shooting incident at the restaurant. When Foster expresses distaste for the store owner's bigotry, the man becomes violent and attempts to turn him over to the police, but Foster stabs him then shoots him dead. Foster changes into army clothes, takes the rocket launcher and leaves.

Foster encounters a road repair crew who are not working and accuses them of doing unnecessary repairs to justify their budget. He pulls out the rocket launcher but struggles to use it, until a boy explains how it works. Foster accidentally fires the launcher, blowing up the construction site. By the time Foster reaches Beth's house, she has already fled with their daughter. He realizes that they may have gone to nearby Venice Pier, but Prendergast and Torres arrive before he can pursue them. Foster shoots Torres, injuring her, and flees with Prendergast in pursuit.

At the pier, Foster confronts his ex-wife and daughter. Adele is happy to see him, but Beth wants him to leave. Prendergast arrives and distracts Foster long enough for Beth to throw his gun into the ocean. Prendergast holds Foster at gunpoint and urges him to surrender. With nothing left for him, Foster [[Suicide by cop|tricks Prendergast into shooting him dead]].

971,My Cousin Vinny,"==Plot==
<!-- NOTICE: Plot summaries should be 400-700 words. See WP:FILMPLOT. Do not add unnecessary details to this section. -->

While driving through Alabama, New York college students who are transferring and got scholarships to UCLA Bill Gambini and Stan Rothenstein stop at a convenience store, during which Bill accidentally shoplifts a can of tuna. After they leave, the boys are pulled over and arrested as the shopkeeper has been found robbed and murdered. At the police station, Bill assumes he has been arrested for shoplifting and confesses to being responsible, resulting in him being charged with [[first-degree murder]] and Stan as an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]]. Unable to afford a private lawyer, Bill asks for help from his cousin Vinny Gambini, a [[personal injury lawyer]] from Brooklyn, who agrees to help the boys. However, they are unaware that Vinny has only just [[Bar examination in the United States|passed the bar]] to become a lawyer, after multiple failed attempts, and has no trial experience. Vinny promptly arrives in Alabama with his fiancée Mona Lisa Vito.

Vinny fools the trial judge, Chamberlain Haller, into believing he is an experienced New York lawyer who works under the alias Jerry Callo. Haller repeatedly holds Vinny in [[Contempt of court|contempt]] for his unprofessional attire, attitude, and ignorance of courtroom decorum, resulting in brief stints in jail. The prosecuting district attorney, Jim Trotter III, presents a strong—although circumstantial—case against the boys, offering multiple witnesses to their involvement in the murder. Bill and Stan become concerned when Vinny declines to [[Cross-examination|cross-examine]] the witnesses during the [[preliminary hearing]], resulting in Stan firing Vinny and hiring the [[Public defender (United States)|public defender]], John Gibbons.

Vinny's inexperience with the legal system leads him to try to trick Trotter into sharing his evidence until Lisa tells Vinny that he legally can access the prosecution's evidence and prompts him to interview the witnesses, which he does. She grows frustrated with Vinny as he promised several years earlier that they would get married when he wins his first case and is worried he never will. Vinny is also eager to prove himself to his mentor Judge Malloy, who convinced him to go into law.

During the trial, Gibbons's nerves and severe stutter only further damage Stan's defense. Meanwhile, Vinny uses an aggressive but perceptive questioning style to discredit Trotter's witnesses, using his knowledge of the cooking time of [[grits]] to force one to admit that his perception of when the crime occurred is inaccurate, and the others by questioning their ability to positively identify the suspects due to obstructions in their sightline and impaired vision. Stan promptly rehires Vinny to defend him.

The next day, Trotter produces a surprise witness, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] analyst George Wilbur, who testifies that tire markings at the crime scene match those on the boys' 1964 [[Buick Skylark#First generation (1964–1967)|Buick Skylark]], although Vinny makes him admit that the tires are the most used in America. Haller orders a lunch recess and denies Vinny's request for a full day's continuance to properly counter Wilbur's testimony. Stressed by lack of sleep, Haller's hostility, low funds, and the prospect of losing the case, Vinny lashes out at Lisa's efforts to help, but realizes that one of the photos she has taken during their stay, showing the tire marks at the scene, may help the case.

After asking the local sheriff for a favor, Vinny drags an angry Lisa into court to testify as an expert witness as she and her family have worked as mechanics and she has an encyclopedic knowledge of cars. Looking at the photo, Lisa realizes that only the 1963 [[Pontiac Tempest]], which resembles a Buick Skylark, could have made the tire tracks, thanks to its [[independent rear suspension]] and [[Limited-slip differential|Positraction]]. Vinny recalls Wilbur who confirms this information, discrediting his own testimony. The sheriff arrives and testifies that, following Vinny's request, he identified two men fitting Bill's and Stan's descriptions who have been arrested in Georgia for driving a stolen Pontiac Tempest and were in possession of a gun matching the murder weapon. His case dismantled, Trotter requests that Haller dismiss all charges. Bill, Stan, the Sheriff, Trotter, and Haller congratulate Vinny on his success. Driving away, Lisa admits that she had Judge Malloy help convince Haller of Jerry Callo's ""successful"" legal career, before she and Vinny bicker about their wedding plans.","Comedy, Crime","starring       = {{Plainlist|

The McCallister family is preparing to spend [[Christmas]] in [[Paris]], gathering at Kate and Peter's home in a Chicago [[Chicago metropolitan area|suburb]] on the night before their departure. Kate and Peter's youngest son, Kevin, is ridiculed by his siblings and cousins due to his immaturity. Kevin inadvertently ruins the family dinner after a scuffle with his oldest brother Buzz, resulting in Kate sending him up to the attic. Kevin berates his mother for allowing the rest of the family to pick on him and wishes that his family would disappear. During the night, heavy winds create a power outage, disabling the alarm clocks and causing the family to oversleep. In the confusion and rush to get to the airport, Kevin is accidentally left behind.

Kevin wakes to find the house empty and the family cars still in the garage, unaware that they had rented vans to take them to the airport. Thinking that his wish came true, he is overjoyed with his newfound freedom. Later, Kevin becomes frightened by his next-door neighbor, ""Old Man"" Marley, rumored to be a serial killer who murdered his own family with a snow shovel. The McCallister home is soon [[Stalking|stalked]] by the ""Wet Bandits"", Harry and Marv, a pair of burglars who have been breaking into other vacant houses in the neighborhood. Kevin tricks them into thinking that his family is still home, forcing them to postpone their plans to rob the McCallister house.

Kate realizes mid-flight that Kevin was left behind. Upon arrival in Paris, the family discovers that all flights for the next two days are booked, and that the phone lines are still down back home in Chicago. Peter and the rest of the family stay at his brother Rob's apartment in Paris, while Kate stays at the airport. She cannot obtain a flight to Chicago and meets with Gus Polinski after arriving in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. He is the lead member of a traveling polka band, and offers to let her travel with them from to Chicago in a [[moving van]] on the way to [[Milwaukee]].

On [[Christmas Eve]], Harry and Marv finally realize that only Kevin is in the McCallister home, and Kevin overhears them discussing plans to break into the house that night. Kevin starts to miss his family and asks the local [[Santa Claus]] impersonator if he could bring them back for Christmas. He goes to church and watches a choir perform, eventually re-encountering Marley, who disproves the rumors about him. Marley points out his granddaughter in the choir and mentions he can only see her there since she is the daughter of his estranged son. Kevin suggests Marley should reconcile with his son.

Kevin returns home and rigs the house with handmade [[booby traps]]. Harry and Marv break in, spring the traps, and suffer various injuries. Kevin calls the police and lures the duo into a vacant neighboring house that they had previously broken into. Harry and Marv ambush Kevin, but Marley intervenes and knocks them out with his shovel. The police arrive and arrest Harry and Marv, having identified all the houses that they broke into due to Marv's habit of flooding them.

On Christmas Day, Kevin is initially disappointed to find that his family is still gone. However, Kate arrives home, and they reconcile. The rest of the family shortly arrive after waiting in Paris for a direct flight to Chicago. Kevin keeps silent about his encounter with Harry and Marv, although Peter finds Harry's knocked-out gold tooth. Kevin happily watches Marley reuniting with his son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter, while Buzz notices the damage Kevin has done to his bedroom.","Comedy, Family","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--Per poster billing-->

They stop at a diner, and when Harry tells Sally she is very attractive, she angrily accuses him of making a pass. They part company in New York, never intending to see each other again.

Five years later in 1982, Harry and Sally find themselves on the same flight. Sally is dating Harry's neighbor Joe, and Harry is engaged to Helen, which surprises Sally, as it seems uncharacteristically optimistic of him. Harry suggests they become friends, forcing him to qualify his previous position about the impossibility of male-female friendships. They separate, concluding that they will not be friends.

Five years later in 1987, Harry and Sally run into each other at a bookstore. They have coffee and talk about their previous relationships; Sally and Joe have broken up and Helen has left Harry for another man. They agree to pursue a friendship and have late-night phone conversations, go to dinner, and spend time together discussing their love-lives.

During a New Year's Eve party, Harry and Sally find themselves growing attracted to each other and share an awkward midnight kiss. They remain friends and set each other up with their respective best friends, Marie and Jess. When the four go out, neither Marie nor Jess is attracted to Harry or Sally and instead immediately fall for each other. Soon after, the two are engaged.

One night, Sally tearfully calls Harry to say that her ex, Joe, is getting married. Harry goes to Sally's apartment to comfort her but they end up having sex. Harry leaves the next morning, feeling awkward and filled with regret. Their friendship cools until they have a heated argument at Jess and Marie's wedding reception. Harry attempts to mend their relationship, but Sally feels that they can no longer be friends.

At a 1988 New Year's Eve party with Jess and Marie, Sally misses Harry. He is spending New Year's Eve at home, watching [[Dick Clark]]'s 16th annual New Year's Rockin' Eve. Before midnight, Harry walks around the city. As Sally is about to leave the party, Harry appears and declares his love for her. She claims he is only there because he is lonely, but he lists the many reasons he loves her. Harry and Sally marry three months later, exactly 12 years and three months after their first meeting.

The film contains several interspersed segments of older couples discussing how they met. The true stories, gathered by Nora Ephron, are reenacted by actors. The final couple interviewed, before the closing credits, is Harry and Sally.","Comedy, Drama, Romance","starring       = {{Plainlist|<!-- per poster -->

Police Squad Lieutenant Frank Drebin is on vacation in [[Beirut]] when he disrupts a conference of America's greatest enemies ([[Idi Amin]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]], [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]], [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Fidel Castro]], and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/lists/5-movies-about-assassination-attempts-on-real-leaders-20141222/the-naked-gun-1988-20141219|title=Before Interviewgate: 5 Movies on Real-Leader Assassinations|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=December 22, 2014|access-date=September 16, 2017|archive-date=July 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707190752/http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/lists/5-movies-about-assassination-attempts-on-real-leaders-20141222/the-naked-gun-1988-20141219|url-status=dead}}</ref>) who are trying to conceive a terrorist plan to humiliate the U.S. In [[Los Angeles]], Officer Nordberg attempts to bust a [[heroin]] operation run by businessman Vincent Ludwig but is shot by Ludwig's henchmen. Drebin returns to L.A. and is briefed on the case before visiting Nordberg in the hospital. Nordberg provides cryptic clues, including a picture of Ludwig's ship on which the deal had been organized. Frank also learns that Nordberg's jacket tested positive for heroin.

Police Squad is put in charge of security for the visit of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] to Los Angeles, and Captain Ed Hocken tells Drebin that he has 24 hours to clear Nordberg before word gets out and detracts from the Queen's visit. Drebin visits Ludwig to inquire about the ship and Ludwig learns that Nordberg is still alive. Ludwig asks his assistant Jane, who is unaware of Ludwig's criminal activities, to get close to Drebin and see what he knows.  Jane provides Drebin with information he requested and the two begin falling in love.  Ludwig meets with Pahpshmir, from the Beirut meeting, to discuss an assassination plot against the Queen. Ludwig agrees to do it for $20&nbsp;million and explains that he will use a [[pager|beeper]] that uses [[post-hypnotic suggestion]] to make anyone an unwitting assassin. Ludwig attempts to have Nordberg killed at the hospital by hypnotizing his doctor, but Drebin successfully protects Nordberg.  The doctor is killed in a comical fashion before Drebin can interrogate him.

Drebin then breaks into Ludwig's office to search for evidence. He finds a note from Pahpshmir to Ludwig which confirms his suspicions, but accidentally starts a fire that destroys the note and the office. Drebin later confronts Ludwig with his allegations at a reception for the Queen's arrival. He misinterprets Ludwig's presentation of a musket to the Queen as an attack and tries to protect her, but only causes more of a problem and is fired from Police Squad. Jane finds out the plan will be executed at a baseball game at [[Angel Stadium|Anaheim Stadium]] and that one of the players will perform the act.  She tells Drebin of the plan but he is forced to sneak into the game in disguise.

Police Squad arrives at the stadium and Drebin tells them about the plot. Drebin knocks the home plate umpire out and takes his place in order to frisk the players for weapons while they are at bat.  Ludwig eventually activates his unwitting assassin, [[Reggie Jackson]] using the hypnotic beeper. Jane alerts Drebin, who chases after Jackson and tackles him, causing a [[bench-clearing brawl]] that allows Jackson to escape. Ludwig holds Jane at gunpoint and begins to leave the stadium while the hypnotized Jackson takes aim at the Queen. Drebin tries to tranquilize Jackson, but misses and hits a large woman on the upper deck. She falls over the railing and lands on Jackson, crushing him and saving the Queen's life.

Drebin follows Ludwig to the top of the stadium and shoots him with another dart. Ludwig fatally plummets over the side of the stadium and is struck by a passing bus, run over by a steamroller, and finally trampled by the [[Spirit of Troy|USC marching band]]. Some of the band members inadvertently step on Ludwig's beeper, triggering Jane to attempt to kill Drebin.  He breaks Jane's hypnosis by openly professing his feelings for her and giving her an engagement ring. Drebin is reinstated to Police Squad and a recovered Nordberg congratulates him. Unfortunately, Drebin accidentally pushes Nordberg's wheelchair down the stadium stairs and launches him onto the field.","Comedy, Crime","starring       = [[Leslie Nielsen]]

<!-- [[WP:FILMPLOT]] recommends that film plots be between 400 and 700 words -->
Following the recent death of his wife, [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) narcotics Sergeant [[Martin Riggs]], a former [[United States Army Special Forces|Special Forces]] soldier, has become suicidal and erratic. Despite the protests of the police therapist, the captain believes Riggs is faking his psychosis to be forcibly retired with a generous pension, and partners him with fellow war veteran and seasoned Homicide Sergeant [[Roger Murtaugh]]. Riggs and Murtaugh do not get along well at first as Murtaugh is equally dismissive of Riggs's mental state, but is eventually convinced Riggs is truly suicidal.

Murtaugh is contacted by a former [[Vietnam War]] friend, Michael Hunsaker, ostensibly to help his daughter Amanda escape her life of prostitution and pornography, but Amanda kills herself by jumping from an apartment balcony before she and Murtaugh meet. Her autopsy shows she was fatally poisoned with tainted drugs, indicating she was potentially murdered. Riggs and Murtaugh attempt to question her pimp, but are assaulted after finding drugs on the premises, forcing Riggs to kill the pimp to save Murtaugh's life. Their final lead is Dixie, a prostitute who witnessed Amanda's death, and whom the pair believe may have poisoned her. Dixie's home explodes as they arrive and her corpse is later recovered. Riggs locates components of a [[mercury switch]] explosive among the debris, a specialty explosive he recalls being used by [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) mercenaries in Vietnam. The suspect is detailed by neighborhood children, who noticed he had an elite special forces tattoo similar to Riggs's.

Suspecting Hunsaker is withholding information, Riggs and Murtaugh visit him at Amanda's funeral. He reveals that during the Vietnam War he worked for ""Shadow Company"", a defunct CIA paramilitary unit tasked with destabilizing the local heroin trade. Following the war, the ex-CIA agents, mercenaries, and soldiers involved reformed Shadow Company as a criminal organization and began shipping large quantities of heroin from Asia to the United States, under the leadership of retired General Peter McAllister and his right-hand man Mr. Joshua. Hunsaker's role as a banker allowed him to make the illicit funds seem legitimate. He initially called Murtaugh to confess and turn witness against Shadow Company, but McAllister had Amanda killed in retaliation. Joshua arrives in a helicopter and kills Hunsaker before escaping. He later attempts to kill Riggs in a drive-by shooting, but the latter is saved by his bulletproof vest; Riggs's death is faked to give the pair an advantage.

Concerned Murtaugh knows too much, Shadow Company kidnaps his daughter Rianne and forces Murtaugh to meet them at [[El Mirage Lake]]. Riggs provides sniper support to help Murtaugh and Rianne escape, but all three are captured and recovered to a nightclub basement, a Shadow Company front. Riggs and Murtaugh are tortured for information until Riggs escapes, kills several Shadow Company members, and frees Murtaugh and Rianne. Although Joshua escapes, Murtaugh kills McAllister. Deducing Joshua will seek revenge at Murtaugh's home, Riggs and Murtaugh ambush him. Riggs defeats Joshua in a brawl, but chooses not to kill him. Police officers take Joshua into custody, but he breaks free, takes an officer's gun, and attempts to shoot Riggs and Murtaugh; the pair return fire and kill Joshua.

A short time later, after visiting his wife's grave, Riggs shares [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] dinner with Murtaugh and his family. He gifts Murtaugh a [[hollow-point bullet]] he has been saving to commit suicide, as he no longer needs it.","Action, Crime, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist |

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->Texas bartender Ray and housewife Abby drive through a downpour at night, discussing Abby's bad marriage to Ray's boss Julian Marty. They have sex at a motel. Private detective Loren Visser takes photos of the tryst and delivers them to Marty. When a caller informs the couple they are being watched, Abby grabs some belongings, including a pistol Marty gave her. Ray goes to the bar to demand his back pay from Marty, who tells Ray that Abby will betray him as she did Marty, and when confronted will say, ""I haven't done anything funny.""

After a botched attempt to kidnap Abby, Marty offers Visser $10,000 to kill Abby and Ray. Visser tells Marty to go fishing and he will call him when it is done. Visser breaks into Ray's home and steals Abby's gun. Visser shows Marty photos of the murdered couple, one of which Marty secretes in the safe while retrieving the $10,000. Visser shoots Marty with Abby's gun, drops the gun and grabs the money but forgets his cigarette lighter as he leaves.

It is revealed that Visser doctored photos of the sleeping couple to appear that they had been shot. Ray discovers Marty's body, accidentally discharging Abby's gun when he steps on it. He puts the gun in Marty's pocket and the body in his car. Marty is still alive, albeit barely. Ray begins to bury Marty in a shallow grave when Marty aims the gun and pulls the trigger three times, falling on an empty chamber each time. Marty screams as Ray takes the gun and finishes burying him.

Ray tries to explain to Abby that he ""cleaned it all up."" Abby says, ""I haven't done anything funny,"" which leads to an argument. Visser telephones but does not speak when Abby picks up. She assumes and tells Ray that it was Marty. Ray places her gun on a table as he leaves. Bartender Meurice tells Ray about a phone message Marty left regarding money stolen from the safe - Marty's cover for the $10,000 he paid Visser.

While burning the doctored photos, Visser realizes that Marty kept one, and that he left his lighter. His attempt to break into the safe is thwarted by Abby, who thinks Ray damaged the safe and realizes Marty might be dead. She has a nightmare of Marty warning her that Ray will kill her as well. She confronts Ray, who tells her Marty was still alive when he buried him.

Ray opens the safe and discovers the doctored photo. He goes to Abby's apartment to warn her. Visser kills Ray with a rifle shot from a rooftop across the street. Abby smashes the lightbulb and hides in the bathroom.

Visser enters the apartment and searches Ray for the lighter, and finds Abby has climbed out of the window into the next apartment. She stabs him with Ray's knife, pinning his hand to the sill. As she backs away, Visser empties his gun into the wall, then punches through it to remove the knife. Returning to her apartment, Abby picks up her gun and shoots Visser through the bathroom door. She says, ""I'm not afraid of you, Marty,"" and Visser, lying wounded, laughs and responds, ""Well, ma'am, if I see him, I'll sure give him the message.""","Crime, Drama, Thriller","starring       = {{Plain list|

He outmaneuvers a group of marauders led by biker Wez using his driving skills and a shotgun. He steals gasoline from the wrecked vehicles of one of his pursuers and inspects a wrecked semi-trailer and [[Tractor unit|prime mover]].

Later, Max tries collecting an apparently abandoned [[gyrocopter]]'s fuel, but is ambushed by the pilot. Max overpowers the man with his dog's help, sparing his life in return for being led to a working oil refinery the pilot has discovered. They arrive during the daily attack on the facility by a motorised gang, of which Wez is a member.

The next day, Max witnesses cars leave the besieged compound and get chased down by marauders. He rescues Nathan, the sole survivor of one car, and strikes a deal to return him to the complex in exchange for fuel, but the man dies after Max gets him back, and the leader of the settlers, Pappagallo, says the deal died with Nathan. The settlers are about to confiscate Max's car and cast him out of their compound when the marauders return to negotiate. A feral child who lives in the refinery compound kills Wez's partner with a metal boomerang and Wez wants revenge, but the gang's leader, a masked man called ""Lord Humungus"", offers to spare the settlers' lives in exchange for their fuel supply and leaves for the day. However, the settlers are divided over whether or not they can trust Humungus.

Max offers his own deal: he will bring them the semi-truck he saw earlier so they can try to haul away their [[Tank truck|tanker]] full of oil, if they return his car and give him as much fuel as he can carry. The settlers agree, and that night Max sneaks past the marauders on foot carrying fuel for the truck. He encounters the Gyro Captain and forces him to fly him to the truck, which he gets started. It is somewhat damaged as Max passes through the marauders' encampment en route to the refinery, but he makes it, followed by the gyrocopter.

Max refuses Pappagallo's entreaty to accompany the settlers to a fabled northern paradise,{{efn|Revealed by a set of postcards to be the [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]].}} opting instead to collect his fuel and leave. Wez catches him using Humungus's [[Nitrous oxide engine|nitrous oxide]]-equipped vehicle and causes him to crash. A Marauder kills Max's dog and is about to kill the seriously-injured Max when Marauder Toadie attempts to siphon the fuel from the tanks of Max's car, triggering the vehicle to self-destruct. Left for dead, Max is rescued by the Gyro Captain and returned to the compound.

Despite his injuries, Max insists on driving the repaired truck during the escape. His support consists of the Gyro Captain, Pappagallo in a separate vehicle, three of the settlers on the outside of the armoured tanker, and the Feral Kid, who jumps on the truck as it is leaving. The marauders pursue the tanker, allowing the remaining settlers to flee their compound in a caravan of smaller vehicles after rigging the refinery to explode.

Pappagallo and the three settlers are killed and the Gyro Captain is shot down. Max turns the truck around and, as he is fighting with Wez, Humungus collides with the truck head on, killing Wez and himself. The truck rolls off the road and the surviving marauders survey the scene, only to abandon their chase when they see the tanker leaking sand and not gas. As Max carries the Feral Kid from the wrecked tanker, he inspects the sand pouring out. The Gyro Captain drives up and the two share a grin as Max realizes the tanker was a diversion the whole time. They rendezvous with the settlers, who transported the fuel in oil drums inside their vehicles.

The Gyro Captain succeeds Pappagallo as leader of the settlers and takes them north. The grown Feral Kid, ""Chief of the Great Northern Tribe,"" reveals in [[voice-over]] that he never saw ""the Road Warrior"" again.","Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","starring = [[Mel Gibson]]

The story opens with [[the Muppets]] sitting down for a private screening of a movie that acts as a [[pastiche]] of how they all met.

[[Kermit the Frog]] lives a simple life in a Florida swamp. After he plays [[American Banjo Museum#Jim Henson|his banjo]] and sings ""[[Rainbow Connection]]"", he is approached by Bernie, a [[talent agent]] who encourages Kermit to pursue a career in show business before being chased away by a nearby [[alligator]] named Arnie. Inspired by the idea of ""making millions of people happy"", Kermit sets off on a cross-country trip to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]].

Kermit meets [[Fozzie Bear]], who is working as a hapless stand-up comedian, and Kermit invites Fozzie on his journey. The two set out in Fozzie's 1951 [[Studebaker Champion|Studebaker]], but are soon pursued by entrepreneur Doc Hopper and his assistant Max in an attempt by Hopper to convince Kermit to be the new spokesfrog of Hopper's struggling [[Deep frying|French-fried]] [[frog legs]] restaurant franchise. Horrified, Kermit refuses and he and Fozzie drive away. Unwilling to accept Kermit's refusal, Hopper resorts to increasingly forceful means of persuasion. In an old church, Kermit and Fozzie meet the rock band [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem]], and the band's manager [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]], who help them disguise their car. Driving on, they meet and are joined by [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] and his girlfriend [[List of Muppets#Camilla the Chicken|Camilla the Chicken]], who are also interested in becoming movie stars. They trade in their failing vehicle at a used car lot, where they meet [[List of Muppets#Sweetums|Sweetums]]. They invite Sweetums to come with them, but he runs away. The others drive away, only for Sweetums to emerge and reveal that he had only gone to pack his things.

The group meets [[Miss Piggy]] at a county fair, and she and Kermit immediately become love-stricken with each other. When Kermit and Miss Piggy meet for dinner that night, Hopper and Max sneak up on Miss Piggy and abduct her as bait to lure Kermit. When Kermit arrives at the designated location, mad scientist Professor Krassman tries to brainwash Kermit into performing in Hopper's advertisements, but Miss Piggy furiously knocks out Hopper's henchmen and causes Krassman to be brainwashed by his own device. However, immediately after the fight and saving Kermit, Miss Piggy receives a job offer and promptly abandons a devastated Kermit.

Joined by [[Rowlf the Dog]] and reunited with Miss Piggy along the way, the Muppets continue their journey to Hollywood, but their car breaks down in the desert. Sitting at a campfire, the group sadly realizes that they will likely miss the audition the next day. Kermit wanders off, ashamed for bringing his friends on a fruitless journey, but some [[Internal monologue|personal reflection]] restores his commitment. He returns to camp, where he discovers that the Electric Mayhem have come to their rescue, [[fourth wall|having learned of their plight by reading ahead in the film's script]]. The Mayhem offer to drive the entire group the rest of the way in their bus.

The group is warned by a reformed Max that Hopper has hired an assassin, Snake Walker, to kill Kermit.  Kermit decides to face his aggressor and proposes a Western-style showdown in a nearby [[ghost town]]. There, they find inventor [[Bunsen Honeydew|Dr. Bunsen Honeydew]] and his assistant [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]]. Kermit confronts Hopper with an appeal to Hopper's own hopes and dreams, but Hopper is unmoved and orders his henchmen to kill Kermit and his friends. They are saved when one of Dr. Honeydew's inventions, ""insta-grow"" pills, temporarily enlarges Mayhem drummer [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]], who frightens away Hopper and his henchmen for good, Max cheering for the Muppets before he leaves.

Once the Muppets reach the Hollywood studio, they finally meet studio executive Lew Lord, who signs the Muppets to a ""standard 'rich and famous' contract"". The first take in their attempt to perform the script goes awry when Gonzo crashes into the prop rainbow, and an explosion blows a hole in the roof of the studio; a rainbow shines through the hole and illuminates the Muppets. Joined by Muppet characters from other Henson productions, including ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas]]'', and ''[[The Land of Gorch]]'', the Muppets all sing the final verse in a reprise of ""Rainbow Connection"" together as the film ends; just as Sweetums tears through the screen, elated that he finally caught up with them.","Adventure, Comedy, Family","starring       = {{Plainlist|

In the [[Sonoran Desert]], French scientist Claude Lacombe, his American interpreter, cartographer David Laughlin, and other researchers discover [[Flight 19]], a group of  [[United States Navy]] [[Grumman TBM Avenger]] [[torpedo bombers]] that went missing over the [[Bermuda Triangle]] on December 5, 1945. The planes are in perfect condition, but without any occupants. An elderly witness nearby claims ""the sun came out at night, and sang to him"".  Near [[Indianapolis]], [[air traffic control]]lers watch two airline flights narrowly avoid a mid-air collision with an [[unidentified flying object]].

At a rural home outside [[Muncie, Indiana]], three-year-old Barry Guiler wakes to find his toys operating on their own. He starts to follow something outside, forcing his mother, Jillian, to chase after him. Large-scale power outages begin rolling through the area, forcing electric utility lineman Roy Neary  to investigate. While he gets his bearings, Roy experiences a close encounter with a UFO, and when it flies over his truck, it lightly burns the side of his face with its lights. The UFO takes off with three others in the sky, as Roy and three police cars give chase. The spacecraft fly off into the night sky but the metaphysical experience leaves Roy mesmerized.

The researchers are similarly baffled to find the {{ship|SS|Cotopaxi}} in the middle of the [[Gobi Desert]], intact and completely empty.

Roy becomes fascinated by UFOs to the dismay of his wife, Ronnie. He obsesses over subliminal images of a mountain shape, often making models of it. Jillian, meanwhile, also becomes obsessed, sketching the unique mountain image. Soon after, she is terrorized in her home by a UFO which descends from the clouds. She fights off violent attempts by the UFO and unseen beings to enter the home, but in the chaos, Barry is abducted.

Lacombe, Laughlin, and a group of [[United Nations]] experts continue to investigate increasing UFO activity and strange, related occurrences. Witnesses in [[Dharamsala]], [[Northern India]] report that the UFOs make distinctive sounds: a five-tone musical phrase in a pentatonic scale. Scientists broadcast the phrase to outer space, but are mystified by the response, a seemingly meaningless series of numbers (104 44 30 40 36 10) repeated until Laughlin, with his background in [[cartography]], recognizes it as a set of geographical coordinates, which point to [[Devils Tower]] near [[Moorcroft, Wyoming]]. Lacombe and the U.S. military converge on Wyoming. The United States Army evacuates the area, planting false reports in the media that a train wreck has spilled a toxic nerve gas, while actually preparing a secret landing zone for the UFOs and their occupants.

Meanwhile, Roy's increasingly eccentric behavior causes Ronnie to abandon him, taking their three children with her. When a news program about a supposed train wreck near Devils Tower airs on television, Roy and Jillian recognize the same mountain they have been visualizing. They, along with other travelers experiencing similar visions, set out for Devils Tower in spite of the public warnings about toxic gas.

Most of the travelers are apprehended by the Army, but Roy and Jillian reach the site just as UFOs appear in the night sky. The government specialists at the site begin to communicate with the UFOs, which gradually appear by the dozens, by using light and sound on a large electrical billboard. An enormous mothership eventually lands to release many abductees from different eras: World War II pilots, ''Cotopaxi'' sailors, adults, children, and animals. Barry also returns and reunites with Jillian. The government officials hastily prepare Roy for inclusion in its select group of potential visitors to the mothership.

The [[Grey alien|extraterrestrials]] finally emerge from the mothership and select Roy to join their travels. As Roy enters the mothership, one of the extraterrestrials pauses for a few moments with the humans. Lacombe uses [[Kodály method#Hand signs|Curwen hand signs]] that correspond to the five-note extraterrestrial tonal phrase. The extraterrestrial replies with the same gestures, smiles, and returns to its ship, which takes to the sky.","Drama, Sci-Fi","starring       = {{Plainlist|

During a thunderstorm in early September 1944, units of the [[35th Infantry Division (United States)|35th Infantry Division]] are nearing the French town of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]. One of the division's mechanized reconnaissance platoons is ordered to hold their position when the Germans counterattack. The outnumbered platoon is also hit by [[friendly fire]] from their own mortars.

Private Kelly, a former lieutenant scapegoated for a failed infantry assault, captures Colonel Dankhopf of [[Wehrmacht]] [[Abwehr|Intelligence]]. Interrogating his prisoner, Kelly notices the officer's briefcase has several gold bars disguised under lead plating. Curious, he gets the colonel drunk and learns that there is a cache of 14,000 gold bars, worth $16 million (about ${{Inflation|US|16|1944|r=-1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), stored in a bank vault {{convert|30|mi|km|round=5}} behind German lines in the French town of Clermont. When their position is overrun and the Americans pull back, a [[Tiger I]] tank kills Dankhopf.

Kelly decides to steal the gold. He recruits Supply Sergeant ""Crapgame"" in order to obtain the supplies and the weapons needed. A spaced-out tank commander known as ""Oddball"" overhears the heist plan and suggests that his three unattached [[M4 Sherman]] tanks join the caper. With their commanding officer, Captain Maitland, preoccupied with visiting his uncle ""The General"" (and stealing a yacht), the members of Kelly's platoon are all eager to join Kelly in the heist. After much argument, Kelly finally persuades cynical Master Sergeant ""Big Joe"" to go along.

Kelly decides that his infantrymen and Oddball's tanks and crew will proceed separately and meet near Clermont. The Shermans fight their way through the German lines, destroying a railway depot in the process, but the bridge that they must cross is blown up by Allied fighter-bombers. Oddball contacts an engineering unit to build a [[Bailey bridge|bridge]] for the crossing, and the engineers in turn bring in even more men to supply support.

After losing their jeeps and [[half-track]]s to friendly fire from an American fighter aircraft that mistakes them for German soldiers, Kelly and his men proceed on foot. They walk into a minefield, and Private Grace is blown up when he steps on a mine. Forced to engage a German patrol that arrives to investigate the explosion, the last two men still trapped in the minefield, PFC Mitchell and Corporal Job, are killed before Kelly's team can eliminate the German soldiers.

Oddball links up with Kelly two nights later, bringing with him the extra troops that he has acquired, and they battle their way across the river to Clermont. By this time, intercepted radio messages attract the notice of Major General Colt, who misinterprets them as efforts by an aggressive Army unit pushing forward on their own initiative and immediately rushes to the new front to exploit this ""breakthrough.""

Clermont is defended by three [[Tiger I]] tanks of the [[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|1st SS Panzer Division]] and its infantry support. The Americans are able to eliminate the German infantry and two of the Tigers, but the final tank parks itself right in front of the bank after Oddball's last Sherman breaks down, leaving them stalemated. At Crapgame’s suggestion, Kelly, Big Joe, and Oddball approach the Tiger and offer the commander and his crew ""a deal-deal"": equal shares of the gold if the Tiger will shoot the armored doors off the bank.

After the Tiger blows the bank doors open, the German and American soldiers divide the spoils, each gold share amounting to $875,000 (about ${{Inflation|US|0.875|1944}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}). They go their separate ways, just barely ahead of the still-oblivious General Colt. Colt's way into Clermont has been blocked by the joyous crowd of relieved French residents, who have been deceived by Big Joe into thinking that Colt is French Gen.

994,Blowup,"== Plot ==
After spending the night at a [[flophouse|doss house]], where he has taken pictures for a book of art photographs, photographer Thomas is late for a [[photo shoot]] with model [[Veruschka von Lehndorff|Veruschka]] at his studio, which in turn makes him late for a shoot with other models later in the morning. He grows bored and frustrated with the models and walks off, leaving them and the production staff in the lurch. As he leaves the studio, two teenage aspiring models ask to speak to him, but he brushes them off and drives off to visit an antique shop near [[Maryon Park]].

Wandering into the park, Thomas furtively takes photographs of two lovers. The woman, Jane, is furious at being photographed and pursues Thomas, demanding his film and attempting to take his camera. He refuses, and continues to photograph her as she runs away. Thomas then meets his agent Ron for lunch and notices a man following him and looking into his car. Thomas returns to his studio to find Jane, who asks desperately for the film. They have a conversation and flirt, but he deliberately hands her a different roll of film. She, in turn, gives him a false telephone number.

Thomas makes several [[Enlarger|blow-ups]] of the film of Jane and her lover, which reveal Jane appearing to look worriedly at a person lurking in the trees with a pistol. Thomas excitedly calls Ron, claiming that his impromptu photo session may have saved a man's life. He is then disturbed by a knock on the door from the teenage girls. They have a sexual encounter in the studio before he falls asleep. After awakening, he learns that the girls hope he will photograph them, but is distracted by a detail in one of his blow-ups. He tells them to leave, saying, ""Tomorrow! Tomorrow!""

Thomas examines a blurred figure on the ground under a bush in the blow-up, which he suspects is the dead body of a man shot by the gunman. As evening falls, he goes back to the park without his camera and finds the body, but is scared off by the sound of a twig breaking. He returns to his studio to find it ransacked, with all of the negatives and prints gone except for one very grainy blow-up of what is possibly the body.

After driving into town, he sees Jane and follows her into the [[Ricky-Tick]] club, where [[the Yardbirds]] are performing the song ""Stroll On"". A buzzing noise in guitarist [[Jeff Beck]]'s amplifier angers him so much that he smashes his guitar and throws its neck into the crowd. The crowd, previously disengaged, fights over the guitar neck. Thomas grabs the neck and runs out of the club, with much of the crowd chasing after him; once he is away from the crowd, he tosses the neck away and walks on. A passer-by picks up the neck and examines it, but also discards it.

At a drug-drenched party in a house on the Thames, Thomas asks a [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-addled Ron to come to the park as a witness, but cannot convince him of what has happened. Instead, Thomas joins the party at Ron's insistence and wakes up in the house at sunrise. He then returns to the park alone, only to find that the body is gone.

Thomas watches a [[Mime artist|mime]] troupe perform a mock-tennis match at the park, and picks up the imaginary ball and throws it back to the two players when asked. As he watches the mimes continue to play, the sound of the ball being played is heard. His image then fades away, leaving only the grass.","Drama, Mystery, Thriller","starring       = {{Plainlist|

998,From Here to Eternity,"==Plot==
In 1941, bugler and career soldier Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, who was once a professional boxer, transfers from [[Fort Shafter]] to a rifle company at [[Schofield Barracks]] on the island of [[Oahu]]. Captain Dana ""Dynamite"" Holmes wants him on his regimental boxing team, but Prewitt refuses absolutely, with no further explanation. Consequently, Holmes makes Prewitt's life miserable and ultimately orders [[First Sergeant]] Milton Warden to prepare a [[court-martial]]. Warden suggests doubling Prewitt's company punishment as an alternative. Prewitt is hazed by the other [[non-commissioned officer|NCO]]s and is supported only by his close friend, Private Angelo Maggio.

Prewitt and Maggio join a social club where Prewitt becomes attracted to Lorene. Prewitt confides to her he quit boxing after blinding his sparring partner. At the club, Maggio argues with [[Military prison|stockade]] Sergeant ""Fatso"" Judson. Later, at a local bar, Judson provokes Maggio and the two nearly come to blows before Warden intervenes.

Despite being warned, Warden risks prison when he starts fraternizing with Holmes' wife, Karen. Her marriage to Holmes is unhappy and distant, made worse after Holmes' drinking and infidelity resulted in the stillbirth of her only child and consequent infertility. Karen encourages Warden to become an officer, which would enable her to divorce Holmes and marry him.

Maggio is sentenced to the stockade after walking off guard duty and getting drunk, subjecting him to Judson's unqualified (and unauthorized) wrath. Prewitt discovers Lorene's name is really Alma, and her goal is to make enough money at the club to go back to the mainland and marry. Prewitt tells her his career is in the military, and the two wonder whether they have a future together.

A member of Holmes' boxing team, Sergeant Galovitch, picks a fight with Prewitt. Holmes observes without intervening, as does the regimental commander. Holmes is about to punish Prewitt again but does nothing after learning Galovitch started the fight.

Maggio escapes from the stockade after a brutal beating from Judson and dies in Prewitt's arms. Seeking revenge, Prewitt engages Judson in a back alley knife fight. Prewitt kills Judson but is badly wounded and stays with Lorene. Warden covers for Prewitt's [[AWOL|absence]].

After initiating a review into Holmes' conduct, the regimental commander orders his resignation in lieu of a court martial. Holmes' replacement, Captain Ross, reprimands the other NCOs, demotes Galovitch to private, and affirms there will be no more promotions through boxing. Karen tells Warden that Holmes' resignation is forcing them back to the mainland, but Warden reveals he has no interest in becoming an officer, effectively ending their relationship. Warden promises her that they will meet somewhere someday.

On December 7, the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack Pearl Harbor]]. Despite Lorene's pleas to stay with her, Prewitt attempts to rejoin his company but is shot dead by [[military police]] when he refuses to halt. Warden identifies him as a hardhead but a good soldier.

Days later, Karen and Lorene coincidentally stand next to each other on a ship going to the mainland. Karen tosses her [[Lei (garland)|leis]] into the sea, wondering if she will ever return to Hawaii. Lorene tells Karen she is not returning as her ""fiancé"", whom she identifies as Prewitt, was a bomber pilot who died during the attack and was awarded a [[Silver Star]]. Karen recognizes the name but says nothing.","Drama, Romance, War","starring       = {{ubl|[[Burt Lancaster]]|[[Montgomery Clift]]|[[Deborah Kerr]]|[[Donna Reed]]|[[Frank Sinatra]]|}}
