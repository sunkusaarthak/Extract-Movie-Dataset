            "plot": "In 1947, Portland, Maine banker Andy Dufresne arrives at Shawshank State Prison to serve two consecutive life sentences for murdering his wife and her lover. He is befriended by Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, a contraband smuggler serving a life sentence, who procures a rock hammer and a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Assigned to work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequently raped by \"the Sisters\" prison gang and their leader, Bogs Diamond. In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After the Sisters beat Andy to near-death, Hadley beats and cripples Bogs, who is subsequently transferred to a minimum security hospital; Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the decrepit prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen, a front to use Andy\\'s financial expertise to manage financial matters for other prison staff and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature requesting funds to improve the library. Brooks is paroled in 1954 after serving 50 years, but cannot adjust to the outside world and eventually hangs himself. The legislature sends a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro; Andy plays an excerpt over the public address system and is punished with solitary confinement. After his release from solitary, Andy explains to a dismissive Red that hope is what gets him through his sentence. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. Andy launders the money using the alias \"Randall Stephens.\" In 1965, Andy and Red befriend Tommy Williams, a young prisoner incarcerated for burglary. A year later, Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (GED) exam. Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that his cellmate at another prison had claimed responsibility for the murders for which Andy was convicted. Andy brings the information to Norton, who does not want to know. When Andy mentions the money laundering, Norton sends him to solitary confinement and has Hadley fatally shoot Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. After Andy refuses to continue the money laundering, Norton threatens to destroy the library, remove Andy\\'s protection by the guards, and move him to worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months and tells a skeptical Red that he dreams of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican town on the Pacific coast. He asks Red to promise, once he is released, to travel to a specific hayfield near Buxton, Maine and recover a package that Andy buried there. Red worries about Andy\\'s mental well-being, especially when he learns he had asked a fellow inmate for a rope. At the next day\\'s roll call, the guards find Andy\\'s cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at the poster hanging on the cell wall, and finds behind it a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over nearly two decades. The previous night, he had used the rope to escape through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, taking Norton\\'s suit, shoes, and ledger, containing evidence of the money laundering and corruption at Shawshank. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens and withdraws over $370,000 of the laundered money from several banks, and mails the ledger to a local newspaper. State police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest. The following year, Red is paroled after serving 40 years but struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter inviting him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole by traveling to Fort Hancock, Texas and crossing the border into Mexico, admitting that he finally feels hope. He finds Andy on a Zihuatanejo beach, and the reunited friends happily embrace.",

            "plot": "In 1945, the New York City Corleone family don, Vito Corleone, listens to requests during his daughter Connie\\'s wedding to Carlo Rizzi. Vito\\'s youngest son Michael, a Marine who has thus far stayed out of the family business, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and Vito\\'s godson, seeks Vito\\'s help in securing a movie role. Vito sends his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to persuade studio president Jack Woltz to offer Johnny the part. Woltz refuses Hagen\\'s request at first, but soon complies after finding the severed head of his prized stud horse in his bed. As Christmas approaches, drug baron Virgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo asks Vito to invest in his narcotics business and for police protection. Vito declines, citing that involvement in narcotics would alienate his political connections. Suspicious of Sollozzo\\'s partnership with the Tattaglia crime family, Vito sends his enforcer Luca Brasi to the Tattaglias on an espionage mission. Brasi is garroted to death during the initial meeting. Later, enforcers gun down Vito and coerce Hagen into a meeting. With Vito\\'s first-born Sonny now in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept the narcotics deal. Vito survives the shooting and is visited in the hospital by Michael, who finds him unprotected after NYPD officers on Sollozzo\\'s payroll clear out Vito\\'s guards. Michael thwarts the attempt on his father\\'s life but is beaten by corrupt police captain Mark McCluskey. After the attempted hit at the hospital, Sonny retaliates with a hit on Bruno Tattaglia. Sollozzo and McCluskey request to meet with Michael and settle the dispute. Michael feigns interest and agrees to meet, but hatches a plan with Sonny and Corleone capo Clemenza to kill them and go into hiding. Michael meets Sollozzo and McCluskey at a Bronx restaurant; after retrieving a handgun planted in the bathroom by Clemenza, he shoots both men dead. Despite a clampdown by the authorities for the killing of a police captain, the Five Families erupt in open warfare. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo, Vito\\'s second son, is sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. In Sicily, Michael meets and marries a local woman, Apollonia. Sonny publicly attacks and threatens Carlo for physically abusing Connie. When he abuses her again, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed and murdered by gangsters at a highway toll booth. Apollonia is killed shortly thereafter by a car bomb intended for Michael. Devastated by Sonny\\'s death and tired of war, Vito sets a meeting with the Five Families. He assures them that he will withdraw his opposition to their narcotics business and forgo avenging Sonny\\'s murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay. Kay gives birth to two children in the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo not suited to lead, Michael assumes the position of head of the Corleone family. Vito reveals to Michael that it was Don Barzini who ordered the hit on Sonny and warns him that Barzini would try to kill him at a meeting organized by a traitorous Corleone capo. With Vito\\'s support, Michael relegates Hagen to managing operations in Las Vegas as he is not a \"wartime consigliere\". Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene\\'s stake in the family\\'s casinos and is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family. In 1955, Vito dies of a heart attack while playing with Michael\\'s son Anthony. At Vito\\'s funeral, Tessio asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling his betrayal. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie\\'s baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child\\'s godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the dons of the Five Families, in addition to Greene for not selling his hotel and Tessio for betraying Michael. Michael extracts Carlo\\'s confession for his involvement in Sonny\\'s murder. He assures Carlo that he is being exiled, not murdered. However, Clemenza strangles Carlo in a car moments after his confession. Connie confronts Michael about his involvement in Carlo\\'s death while Kay is in the room. Kay asks Michael if he ordered Carlo\\'s death and is relieved when he denies responsibility. As she leaves, capos enter the office and pay reverence to Michael as \"Don Corleone\".",

            "plot": "A gang of masked criminals rob a mafia-owned bank in Gotham City, betraying and killing each other until the sole survivor, the Joker, reveals himself as the mastermind and escapes with the money. The vigilante Batman, district attorney Harvey Dent, and police lieutenant Jim Gordon ally to eliminate Gotham\\'s organized crime. Batman\\'s true identity, the billionaire Bruce Wayne, publicly supports Dent as Gotham\\'s legitimate protector, as Wayne believes Dent\\'s success will allow Batman to retire, allowing him to romantically pursue his childhood friend Rachel Dawes, despite her relationship with Dent. Gotham\\'s mafia bosses gather to discuss protecting their organizations from the Joker, the police, and Batman. The Joker interrupts the meeting and offers to kill Batman for half of the fortune their accountant, Lau, concealed before fleeing to Hong Kong to avoid extradition. With the help of Wayne Enterprises CEO Lucius Fox, Batman finds Lau in Hong Kong and returns him to the custody of Gotham police. His testimony enables Dent to apprehend the crime families. The bosses accept the Joker\\'s offer, and he kills high-profile targets involved in the trial, including the judge and police commissioner. Although Gordon saves the mayor, the Joker threatens that his attacks will continue until Batman reveals his identity. He targets Dent at a fundraising dinner and throws Rachel out of a window, but Batman rescues her. Wayne struggles to understand the Joker\\'s motives, but his butler Alfred Pennyworth says \"some men just want to watch the world burn.\" Dent claims he is Batman to lure out the Joker, who attacks the police convoy transporting him. Batman and Gordon apprehend the Joker, and Gordon is promoted to commissioner. At the police station, Batman interrogates the Joker, who says he finds Batman entertaining and has no intention of killing him. Having deduced Batman\\'s feelings for Rachel, the Joker reveals she and Dent are being held separately in buildings rigged to explode. Batman races to rescue Rachel while Gordon and the other officers go after Dent, but they discover the Joker gave their positions in reverse. The explosives detonate, killing Rachel and severely burning Dent\\'s face on one side. The Joker escapes custody, extracts the fortune\\'s location from Lau, and burns it, killing Lau in the process. Wayne Enterprises accountant Coleman Reese deduces and tries to expose Batman\\'s identity, but the Joker threatens to blow up a hospital unless Reese is killed. While the police evacuate hospitals and Gordon struggles to keep Reese alive, the Joker meets with a disillusioned Dent, persuading him to take the law into his own hands and avenge Rachel. Dent defers his decision-making to his now half-scarred, two-headed coin, killing the corrupt officers and the mafia involved in Rachel\\'s death. As panic grips the city, the Joker reveals two evacuation ferries, one carrying civilians and the other prisoners, are rigged to explode at midnight unless one group sacrifices the other. To the Joker\\'s disbelief, the passengers refuse to kill one another. Batman subdues the Joker but refuses to kill him. Before the police arrest the Joker, he says although Batman proved incorruptible, his plan to corrupt Dent has succeeded. Dent takes Gordon\\'s family hostage, blaming his negligence for Rachel\\'s death. He flips his coin to decide their fates, but Batman tackles him to save Gordon\\'s son, and Dent falls to his death. Believing Dent is the hero the city needs and the truth of his corruption will harm Gotham, Batman takes the blame for his death and actions and persuades Gordon to conceal the truth. Pennyworth burns an undelivered letter from Rachel to Wayne that says she chose Dent, and Fox destroys the invasive surveillance network that helped Batman find the Joker. The city mourns Dent as a hero, and the police launch a manhunt for Batman.",

            "plot": "The hobbit D\u00e9agol discovers the One Ring in a river while fishing with his cousin Sm\u00e9agol. The Ring immediately ensnares Sm\u00e9agol\\'s mind, and he kills his cousin for it. Increasingly corrupted physically and mentally, he retreats into the Misty Mountains and becomes known as Gollum. Centuries later, during the War of the Ring, Gandalf leads Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and King Th\u00e9oden of Rohan to Isengard, where they reunite with Merry and Pippin. Gandalf retrieves Saruman\\'s palant\u00edr, and the group returns to Edoras to celebrate their victory at Helm\\'s Deep. Pippin looks into the palant\u00edr, seeing Sauron and a burning tree. Gandalf deduces that the enemy plans to attack Gondor\\'s capital Minas Tirith; he rides there to warn Gondor\\'s corrupt steward Denethor. Pippin, who accompanies him, swears fealty to Denethor, whose now-dead heir Boromir had saved his life; on Gandalf\\'s instruction, Pippin triggers the lighting of the beacons, which call for help from Rohan. Frodo, who carries the Ring, and Sam continue their journey towards Mordor, unaware that Gollum, now their guide, plans to betray them and take the Ring for himself. The trio witness the Witch-king of Angmar, lord of the nine Nazg\u00fbl, setting off towards Gondor with his army of Orcs. Gollum frames Sam for eating food supplies and desiring the Ring; Frodo is deceived and orders Sam to go home. As King Th\u00e9oden gathers his army, Elrond tells Aragorn that Arwen is dying, having refused to leave Middle-earth. Elrond gives Aragorn And\u00faril, reforged from the shards of King Elendil\\'s sword Narsil, and urges him to claim Gondor\\'s throne, to which he is heir. Aragorn travels the Paths of the Dead with Legolas and Gimli and pledges to release the ghosts there from their curse should they come to Gondor\\'s aid. Gollum tricks Frodo into venturing alone into the giant spider Shelob\\'s lair. Frodo narrowly escapes and confronts Gollum, who falls down a chasm after a scuffle. Shelob discovers, paralyses, and binds Frodo, but is wounded and driven away by a returning Sam. Sam mourns Frodo\\'s apparent death and takes the Ring, but then realizes his mistake when Orcs take Frodo captive. He rescues Frodo within Mordor and the two continue towards Mount Doom. Denethor sends his younger son, Faramir, on a suicide charge. Faramir returns gravely wounded; believing him dead, Denethor falls into madness. Gandalf marshals the defenders, but the enormous Orc army breaks into the city. Denethor attempts to burn himself and Faramir on a pyre, but Pippin alerts Gandalf and they rescue Faramir. Denethor, set ablaze, jumps to his death. Th\u00e9oden arrives and leads his army against the Orcs. Despite initial success in the ensuing battle, they are decimated by the Oliphaunt-riding Haradrim and the Witch-king mortally wounds Th\u00e9oden; however, his niece \u00c9owyn slays the Witch-king with Merry\\'s help before Th\u00e9oden dies in his niece\\'s arms. Aragorn arrives with his Army of the Dead, who overcome Sauron\\'s forces. Their oath fulfilled, the Dead are released from their curse. Aragorn decides to march on Mordor to distract Sauron from Frodo and Sam; all of Sauron\\'s remaining forces march to meet Aragorn\\'s diversion, allowing the hobbits to reach Mount Doom. Gollum, having survived his fall, attacks, but Frodo enters the mountain. There, he succumbs to the Ring\\'s power, putting it on his finger. Gollum bites Frodo\\'s finger off and reclaims the Ring, leading to a scuffle before they stumble off the ledge. Frodo clings to the ledge and Sam pulls him up while Gollum falls into the lava with the Ring, destroying it and vanquishing Sauron once and for all. The lands of Mordor collapse into the earth, destroying the Orc army. Frodo and Sam narrowly escape the erupting Mount Doom and are saved by Gandalf with the help of eagles. The surviving Fellowship is happily reunited in Minas Tirith. Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor and marries Arwen; they and everyone else present bow to the hobbits. The hobbits return home to the Shire, where Sam marries Rosie Cotton. Four years later, Frodo, still plagued by trauma and the pain of his wound inflicted by the Witch-king, departs Middle-earth for the Undying Lands with his uncle Bilbo, Gandalf, and the Elves. He leaves Sam the Red Book of Westmarch, which details their adventures.",

            "plot": "Pulp Fiction's narrative is told out of chronological order and follows three main interrelated stories that each have a different protagonist: Vincent Vega, a hitman; Butch Coolidge, a prizefighter; and Jules Winnfield, Vincent's partner in crime. The film begins with a diner robbery staged by a couple, then begins to shift from one story line to another before returning to the diner for the conclusion. A pair of thieves, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, reminisce on their past robbery attempts as they eat breakfast in a diner. Pumpkin proposes they rob the diner at that moment because he believes the patrons and employees will be unprepared to stop them. Honey Bunny agrees. Two hitmen, Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega, arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, influential local gangster Marsellus Wallace, from a business partner, Brett, and his friends. After Vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, Jules shoots one of Brett's friends. Jules rebukes Brett over his attempt to double-cross Marsellus and recites a passage from the Bible, before he and Vincent kill Brett. Jules and Vincent give the briefcase to Marsellus, who bribes boxer Butch Coolidge to take a dive in his upcoming match. Vincent purchases heroin from his drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up and drives to meet Marsellus's wife, Mia Wallace, having agreed to escort her while Marsellus is out of town for the night. They eat at a 1950s-themed restaurant and participate in a twist contest, then return home. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin, mistakes it for cocaine, and snorts it, resulting in an overdose. Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, where Lance helps revive her by injecting adrenaline into her heart. Vincent takes Mia home, and they agree never to tell Marsellus about the incident. Butch double-crosses Marsellus by winning the bout, but he accidentally kills his opponent in the process. He plans to flee with his girlfriend, Fabienne, but discovers she has forgotten to pack an heirloom: a gold watch which belonged to Butch's father. Returning to his apartment to retrieve it, he notices a gun on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. When Vincent exits the bathroom, Butch shoots him dead and departs. When Marsellus spots Butch stopped at a traffic light, Butch rams his car into him. Marsellus chases him into a pawnshop. Maynard, the shop owner, captures them at gunpoint and binds and gags them in the basement. Maynard and his accomplice, Zed, take Marsellus into another room and begin to rape him. Butch breaks free and is about to escape, but decides to save Marsellus and arms himself with a katana from the pawnshop. He kills Maynard and frees Marsellus, who shoots Zed in the crotch with Maynard's shotgun. Marsellus tells Butch that they are even, and instructs him to tell no one about the incident and depart Los Angeles forever. Butch picks up Fabienne on Zed's chopper and they drive away. In the apartment, after Jules and Vincent kill Brett, another man bursts out of the bathroom and fires at them. Every shot misses and they shoot him dead. Jules says that their survival was a miracle, which Vincent disputes, believing the man was just a lousy shot. While driving away with another one of Brett's friends, Marvin, Vincent accidentally shoots him in the head after Jules drives over an unidentified inconsistency in the roadbed, covering Vincent, Jules, and the car interior in blood. They hide the car at the home of Jules's old friend and former business partner Jimmie, who demands they deal with the problem before his wife Bonnie comes home. Marsellus sends a cleaner, Winston Wolfe, who directs Jules and Vincent to hide the body in the trunk, clean the car, dispose of their bloody clothes and take the car to a junkyard. At the diner from the film's prologue, Jules tells Vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their survival at the apartment was divine intervention. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny hold up the restaurant and demand Marsellus's briefcase. Pumpkin initially holds Jules at gunpoint, but Jules soon overpowers Pumpkin and holds him at gunpoint. Honey Bunny becomes hysterical and points her gun at Jules. Vincent returns with his gun aimed at her, but Jules defuses the situation. He recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave. Jules and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase.",

            "plot": "Dom Cobb and Arthur are \"extractors\" who perform corporate espionage using experimental dream-sharing technology to infiltrate their targets subconscious and extract information. Their latest target, Saito, is impressed with Cobb\\'s ability to layer multiple dreams within each other. He offers to hire Cobb for the ostensibly impossible job of implanting an idea into a person\\'s subconscious; performing \"inception\" on Robert Fischer, the son of Saito\\'s competitor Maurice Fischer, with the idea to dissolve his father\\'s company. In return, Saito promises to clear Cobb\\'s criminal status, allowing him to return home to his children. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: a forger named Eames, a chemist named Yusuf, and a college student named Ariadne. Ariadne is tasked with designing the dream\\'s architecture, something Cobb himself cannot do for fear of being sabotaged by his mind\\'s projection of his late wife, Mal. Maurice Fischer dies, and the team sedates Robert Fischer into a three-layer shared dream on an airplane to America bought by Saito. Time on each layer runs slower than the layer above, with one member staying behind on each to perform a music-synchronized \"kick\" to awaken dreamers on all three levels simultaneously. The team abducts Robert in a city on the first level, but his trained subconscious projections attack them. After Saito is wounded, Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would usually awaken dreamers, Yusuf\\'s sedatives will instead send them into \"Limbo\": a world of infinite subconscious. Eames impersonates Robert\\'s godfather, Peter Browning, to introduce the idea of an alternate will to dissolve the company. Cobb tells Ariadne that he and Mal entered Limbo while experimenting with dream-sharing, experiencing fifty years in one night due to the time dilation with reality. After waking up, Mal still believed she was dreaming. Attempting to \"wake up,\" she committed suicide and framed Cobb for her murder to force him to do the same. Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children behind. Yusuf drives the team around the first level as they are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur. Cobb persuades Robert that Browning has kidnapped him to stop the dissolution and that Cobb is a defensive projection, leading Robert to another third level deeper as part of a ruse to enter Robert\\'s subconscious. In the third level, the team infiltrates an alpine fortress with a projection of Maurice inside, where the inception itself can be performed. However, Yusuf performs his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, forcing Arthur and Eames to improvise a new set of kicks synchronized with them hitting the water by rigging an elevator and the fortress, respectively, with explosives. Mal then appears and kills Robert before he can be subjected to the inception, and he and Saito are lost in Limbo, forcing Cobb and Ariadne to rescue them in time for Robert\\'s inception and Eames\\'s kick. Cobb reveals that during their time in Limbo, Mal refused to return to reality; Cobb had to convince her it was only a dream, accidentally incepting in her the belief that the real world was still a dream. Cobb makes peace with his part in Mal\\'s death. Ariadne kills Mal\\'s projection and wakes Robert up with a kick. Revived into the third level, he discovers the planted idea: his dying father telling him to create something for himself. While Cobb searches for Saito in Limbo, the others ride the synced kicks back to reality. Cobb finds an aged Saito and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awaken on the plane, and Saito makes a phone call. Arriving in Los Angeles, Cobb passes the immigration checkpoint, and his father-in-law accompanies him to his home. Cobb uses Mal\\'s \"totem\" \u2013 a top that spins indefinitely in a dream \u2013 to test if he is indeed in the real world, but he chooses not to observe the result and instead joins his children.",

As his insomnia worsens, he discovers that expressions of emotional vulnerability help him sleep, leading him to join multiple groups for people facing emotionally distressing problems, despite his expressions being fraudulent. His efforts are thwarted when Marla Singer, another impostor, joins the same groups. The Narrator cannot present his fabricated struggles as genuine, or divert his attention from her presence as an impostor, causing his sleeplessness to return. He arranges for them to attend different sessions to regain his ability to sleep and, under certain circumstances, to exchange contact information, to which she reluctantly agrees. On a return flight from work, the Narrator meets a soap salesman, Tyler Durden. After an explosion destroys the Narrator\\'s apartment, he moves into Tyler\\'s decrepit house. They become friends and start an underground fight club in a bar basement. Tyler also saves Marla from an overdose, initiating a sexual relationship between them, while the Narrator remains cold to her. The Narrator quits his job, blackmails his boss for funds, and grows Fight Club, attracting new members, including his cancer support group friend, Bob. Tyler morphs the club into Project Mayhem, committing vandalism to disrupt the social order. Feeling sidelined, the Narrator confronts Tyler, who admits to orchestrating the explosion in the Narrator\\'s apartment and then goes missing. The police kill Bob during a mission, after which the Narrator looks for Tyler. Discovering the project\\'s nationwide reach and being called Tyler Durden by Marla and other people, he realizes he and Tyler are split personalities. Learning that Project Mayhem plans to erase debt records by blowing up the headquarters of credit-card companies, the Narrator unsuccessfully warns Marla and goes to the police, some of whom are also Project Mayhem members. He attempts to disarm the explosives, but Tyler attacks him. Accepting that he is Tyler, he shoots himself in the mouth, \"killing\" Tyler, while the bullet non-fatally passes through the Narrator\\'s cheek. Marla arrives, and the two hold hands as they watch the targeted buildings collapse.",

            "plot": "In the Second Age of Middle-earth, the lords of Elves, Dwarves, and Men are given Rings of Power. Unbeknownst to them, the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring in Mount Doom, instilling into it a great part of his power to dominate the other Rings and conquer Middle-earth. A final alliance of Men and Elves battles Sauron\\'s forces in Mordor. Isildur of Gondor severs Sauron\\'s finger and the Ring with it, thereby vanquishing Sauron and returning him to spirit form. With Sauron\\'s first defeat, the Third Age of Middle-earth begins. The Ring\\'s influence corrupts Isildur, who takes it for himself and is later killed by Orcs. The Ring is lost in a river for 2,500 years until it is found by Gollum, who owns it for over four and a half centuries. The Ring abandons Gollum and is subsequently found by a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who is unaware of its history.Sixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the Shire, reuniting with his old friend, the wizard Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo departs the Shire for one last adventure and leaves his inheritance, including the Ring, to his nephew Frodo Baggins. Gandalf investigates the Ring, discovers its true nature, and learns that Gollum was captured and tortured by Sauron\\'s Orcs, revealing two words during his interrogation: \"Shire\" and \"Baggins.\" Gandalf returns and warns Frodo to leave the Shire. As Frodo departs with his friend, gardener Samwise Gamgee, Gandalf rides to Isengard to meet with the wizard Saruman but discovers his betrayal and alliance with Sauron, who has dispatched his nine undead Nazg\u00fbl servants to find Frodo.Frodo and Sam are joined by fellow hobbits Merry and Pippin, and they evade the Nazg\u00fbl before arriving in Bree, where they are meant to meet Gandalf at the Inn of The Prancing Pony. However, Gandalf never arrives, having been taken prisoner by Saruman. The hobbits are then aided by a Ranger named Strider, who promises to escort them to Rivendell; however, they are ambushed by the Nazg\u00fbl on Weathertop, and their leader, the Witch-King, stabs Frodo with a Morgul blade. Arwen, an Elf and Strider\\'s beloved, locates Strider and rescues Frodo, summoning flood-waters that sweep the Nazg\u00fbl away. She takes him to Rivendell, where he is healed by the Elves. Frodo meets with Gandalf, who escaped Isengard on a Great Eagle. That night, Strider reunites with Arwen, and they affirm their love for each other.Learning of Saruman\\'s betrayal from Gandalf and now realising that they are facing threats from both Sauron and Saruman, Arwen\\'s father, Lord Elrond, decides against keeping the Ring in Rivendell. He holds a council of Elves, Men, and Dwarves, also attended by Frodo and Gandalf, that decides the Ring must be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom. Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, the Elf Legolas, the Dwarf Gimli, Boromir of Gondor, and Strider\u2014who is actually Aragorn, Isildur\\'s heir and the rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo, now living in Rivendell, gives Frodo his sword Sting, and a chainmail shirt made of mithril.The Company of the Ring makes for the Gap of Rohan, but discover it is being watched by Saruman\\'s spies. They instead set off over the mountain pass of Caradhras, but Saruman summons a storm that forces them to travel through the Mines of Moria, where a tentacled water beast blocks off the entrance with the Company inside, giving them no choice but to journey to the exit on the other end. After finding the Dwarves of Moria dead, the Company is attacked by Orcs and a cave troll. They hold them off but are confronted by Durin\\'s Bane: a Balrog residing within the mines. While the others escape, Gandalf fends off the Balrog and casts it into a vast chasm, but the Balrog drags Gandalf down into the darkness with him. The devastated Company reaches Lothl\u00f3rien, ruled by the Elf-queen Galadriel, who privately informs Frodo that only he can complete the quest and that one of the Company will try to take the Ring. She also shows him a vision of the future in which Sauron succeeds in enslaving Middle-earth, including the Shire. Meanwhile, Saruman creates an army of Uruk-hai in Isengard to find and destroy the Company.The Company travels by river to Parth Galen. Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who, as Lady Galadriel had warned, tries to take the Ring. Uruk-hai scouts then ambush the Company, attempting to abduct the Hobbits. Boromir breaks free of the Ring\\'s power and protects Merry and Pippin, but the Uruk-Hai leader, Lurtz, mortally wounds Boromir as they abduct the Hobbits. Aragorn arrives and kills Lurtz before comforting Boromir as he dies, promising to help the people of Gondor in the coming conflict. Fearing the Ring will corrupt his friends, Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone, but allows Sam to come along, recalling his promise to Gandalf to look after him. As Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli set out to rescue Merry and Pippin, Frodo and Sam make their way down the  pass of Emyn Muil, journeying on to Mordor.",

            "plot": "In 1981, at a bus stop in Savannah, Georgia, a man named Forrest Gump recounts his life story to strangers who sit next to him on a bench. In 1951, in Greenbow, Alabama, young Forrest is fitted with leg braces to correct a curved spine, and cannot walk properly. He lives alone with his mother, who runs a boarding house out of their home that attracts many tenants, including a young Elvis Presley, who plays the guitar for Forrest and incorporates Forrest\\'s jerky dance movements into his performances. On his first day of school, Forrest meets a girl named Jenny Curran, and the two become best friends. Forrest is often bullied because of his physical disability and low intelligence. While fleeing from several bullies, his leg braces break off, revealing Forrest to be a very fast runner. This talent eventually allows him to receive a football scholarship at the University of Alabama in 1963, where he is coached by Bear Bryant, and witnesses Governor George Wallace\\'s Stand in the Schoolhouse Door, during which he returns a dropped book to Vivian Malone Jones. Forrest becomes a top kick returner, is named on the All-American team, and meets President John F. Kennedy at the White House. After graduating college in 1966, Forrest enlists in the U.S. Army. During basic training, he befriends a fellow soldier named Benjamin Buford \"Bubba\" Blue, who convinces Forrest to go into the shrimping business with him after their service. In 1967, they are sent to Vietnam, serving with the 9th Infantry Division in the Mekong Delta region. After months of routine operations, their platoon is ambushed while on patrol, and Bubba is killed in action. Forrest saves several wounded platoon mates including his lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both his legs and is awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism by President Lyndon B. Johnson. At the anti-war March on the Pentagon rally, Forrest meets Abbie Hoffman and briefly reunites with Jenny, who has been living a hippie lifestyle. He also develops a talent for ping-pong, and becomes a sports celebrity as he competes against Chinese teams in ping-pong diplomacy, earning him an interview alongside John Lennon on The Dick Cavett Show, influencing the song \"Imagine\". He spends the 1971 New Year\\'s Eve in New York City with Dan, who has become deeply embittered. Forrest soon meets President Richard Nixon and is put up in the Watergate complex, where he unwittingly exposes the Watergate scandal. Discharged from the army, Forrest returns to Greenbow and endorses a company that makes ping-pong paddles. He uses the earnings to buy a shrimping boat in Bayou La Batre, fulfilling his promise to Bubba. Dan joins Forrest in 1974, and they initially have little success. After their boat becomes the only one to survive Hurricane Carmen, they pull in huge amounts of shrimp and create the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, after which Dan finally thanks Forrest for saving his life. Forrest returns home to his mother as she dies of cancer. Dan invests in Apple Inc. and the two become millionaires, but Forrest also shares their earnings with the community and Bubba\\'s family. In 1976, Jenny returns to stay with Forrest, recovering from years of child abuse, drugs, and prostitution. After a while, Forrest proposes to her. She tells Forrest she loves him and the two have sex, but she leaves the next morning. Heartbroken, Forrest goes running and spends the next three years in a relentless cross-country marathon, becoming famous again before returning to Greenbow. In 1981, Forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from Jenny, who asked him to visit her. Forrest is finally reunited with Jenny, who introduces him to their son, Forrest Gump Jr. Jenny tells Forrest she is sick with an unknown incurable virus, and the three move back to Greenbow. Jenny and Forrest finally marry, but she dies a year later. The film ends with Forrest sending his son off on his first day of school.",

They discover that they are being tracked by Gollum, a former bearer of the One Ring. Capturing Gollum, Frodo takes pity and allows him to guide them, reminding Sam that they need Gollums help to infiltrate Mordor. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue a band of Uruk-hai to save their companions, Merry and Pippin, entering the kingdom of Rohan. The Uruk-hai are ambushed by a group of Rohirrim, allowing Merry and Pippin to escape into Fangorn Forest. Meeting Aragorns group, the Rohirrims leader \u00c3\u2030omer explains that he and his men have been exiled by Rohans king, Th\u00c3\u00a9oden, who is under the control of Saruman and his servant Gr\u00c3\u00adma Wormtongue. \u00c3\u2030omer believes Merry and Pippin were killed during the raid but leaves the group with two horses. In Fangorn, Aragorns group encounters Gandalf, who, after dying in battle fighting the Balrog, was resurrected as Gandalf the White to help save Middle-earth. Gandalf leads the trio to Rohans capital, Edoras, where Gandalf frees Th\u00c3\u00a9oden from Sarumans control. Aragorn stops Th\u00c3\u00a9oden from executing Wormtongue, who flees. Learning of Sarumans plans to destroy Rohan with his Uruk-hai army, Th\u00c3\u00a9oden evacuates his citizens to the fortress of the Hornburg at Helms Deep. Gandalf departs to find \u00c3\u2030omer and his followers, hoping they will fight for their restored king. Aragorn befriends Th\u00c3\u00a9odens niece, \u00c3\u2030owyn, who becomes infatuated with him. When the refugees travelling to Helms Deep are attacked by Sarumans Warg-riding Orcs, Aragorn falls from a cliff and is presumed dead. He is found by Th\u00c3\u00a9odreds horse Brego and rides to Helms Deep, witnessing Sarumans army marching toward the fortress. In Rivendell, Arwen is told by her father Elrond that Aragorn will not return. He reminds her that if she remains in Middle-earth, she will outlive Aragorn by thousands of years, and she reluctantly departs for Valinor. Elrond is contacted by Galadriel of Lothl\u00c3\u00b3rien, who convinces him that the Elves should honour their alliance to men, and they dispatch a company of Elves to Helms Deep. In Fangorn, Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard, an Ent. Convincing Treebeard that they are allies, they are brought to an Ent Council, where the Ents decide not to take part in the coming war. Pippin asks Treebeard to take them in the direction of Isengard, where they witness the deforestation caused by Sarumans war effort. Enraged, Treebeard and the Ents storm Isengard, trapping Saruman in his tower. Aragorn arrives at Helms Deep, warning Th\u00c3\u00a9oden of Sarumans army approaching. Th\u00c3\u00a9oden prepares for battle despite being vastly outnumbered. A company of Lothlorien Elves arrives to aid the people of Rohan, shortly before Sarumans army attacks the fortress. The Uruk-hai breach the outer wall with explosives and during the ensuing charge, kill the Elves commander, Haldir. The defenders retreat into the keep, where Aragorn convinces Th\u00c3\u00a9oden to meet the Uruk-hai in one last charge. At dawn, as the defenders are overwhelmed, Gandalf and \u00c3\u2030omer arrive with the Rohirrim, turning the tide of the battle. The surviving Uruk-hai flee into Fangorn Forest and are killed by the trees. Gandalf warns that Sauron will retaliate. Gollum leads Frodo and Sam through the Dead Marshes to the Black Gate, but recommends they enter Mordor by another route. Frodo and Sam are captured by Rangers of Ithilien led by Faramir, younger brother of the late Boromir. Frodo helps Faramir catch Gollum to save him from being killed by the Rangers. Learning of the One Ring, Faramir takes his captives to Gondor to bring the Ring to his father Denethor. Passing through the besieged city of Osgiliath, Frodo tries to explain to Faramir the true nature of the Ring, and Sam explains that Boromir was driven mad by its power. A Nazg\u00c3\u00bbl nearly captures Frodo, who falls under the Rings power, but Sam saves him and reminds a disheartened Frodo that they are fighting for the good still left in Middle-earth. Impressed by Frodos resolve, Faramir releases them. Feeling betrayed by his capture, Gollum decides he will reclaim the Ring by leading Frodo and Sam to Shelob upon arriving at Cirith Ungol.",

            "plot": "At an abandoned hotel, a police squad corners Trinity, who overpowers them with superhuman abilities. She flees, pursued by the police and a group of suited Agents capable of similar superhuman feats. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes. Computer programmer Thomas Anderson, known by his hacking alias \"Neo\", is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase \"the Matrix\". Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named Morpheus has the answers Neo seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by Agent Smith, arrives at Neo\\'s workplace in search of Neo. Though Morpheus attempts to guide Neo to safety, Neo surrenders rather than risk a dangerous escape. The Agents offer to erase Neo\\'s criminal record in exchange for his help with locating Morpheus, who they claim is a terrorist. When Neo refuses to cooperate, they fuse his mouth shut, pin him down, and implant a robotic \"bug\" in his abdomen. Neo wakes up from what he believes to be a nightmare. Soon after, Trinity takes Neo to meet Morpheus, and she removes the bug from Neo. Morpheus offers Neo a choice between two pills: red to reveal the truth about the Matrix or blue to make Neo forget everything and return to his former life. Neo takes the red pill, and his reality begins to distort until he awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless other pods, containing other humans. He is then brought aboard Morpheus\\'s flying ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. As Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the history: in the early 21st century, humanity had developed intelligent machines before war broke out between the two sides. After humans blocked the machines\\' access to solar energy, the machines responded by enslaving humankind and harvesting their bioelectric power while keeping their minds pacified in the Matrix, a shared simulated reality modeled on the world as it was in 1999. In the years following, the remaining free humans took refuge in the underground city of Zion. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix\\'s simulated nature allows them to bend its physical laws. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix kills the physical body too and explains that the Agents are sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels eliminate rebels in the real world. Neo\\'s prowess during virtual training cements Morpheus\\'s belief that Neo is \"the One\", a human prophesied to free humankind. The group enters the Matrix to visit the Oracle, a prophet-like program who predicted that the One would emerge. She implies to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus\\'s life and his own. Before they can leave the Matrix, Agents and police ambush the group, tipped off by Cypher, a disgruntled crew member who has betrayed Morpheus in exchange for a deal to be plugged back into the Matrix to live a comfortable life. To buy time for the others, Morpheus fights Smith and is captured. Cypher exits the Matrix, murders three crew members, and severely wounds a fourth, Tank. Before he can kill Neo and Trinity, Tank regains consciousness and kills him before pulling Neo and Trinity from the Matrix. The Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion, which would allow them to destroy it. Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as the Oracle prophesied; Trinity insists on accompanying him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to those of the Agents. After Morpheus and Trinity safely exit the Matrix, Smith ambushes and appears to kill Neo. While a group of Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar, Trinity confesses her love for Neo and says the Oracle told her she would fall in love with the One. Neo is revived, with newfound abilities to perceive and control the Matrix; he easily defeats Smith, prompting the other Agents to flee, and he leaves the Matrix just as the ship\\'s electromagnetic pulse disables the Sentinels. Back in the Matrix, Neo makes a telephone call, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners \"a world where anything is possible\", before he hangs up and flies away.",

            "plot": "In 1955, Henry Hill becomes enamored by the criminal life and Mafia presence in his working-class Italian-American neighborhood in Brooklyn. He begins working for local caporegime Paulie Cicero and his associates Jimmy \"the Gent\" Conway, an Irish-American truck hijacker and gangster, and Tommy DeVito, a fellow juvenile delinquent. Henry begins as a fence for Jimmy, gradually working his way up to more serious crimes. Through the 1960s, the three men get into carjacking, stealing cargo trucks out of John F. Kennedy International Airport, and eventually commit the Air France Robbery. They spend most of their nights at the Copacabana nightclub carousing with women. Henry starts dating Karen Friedman, a Jewish woman who is initially troubled by Henry\\'s criminal activities. She is then seduced by Henry\\'s glamorous lifestyle, and marries him despite her parents\\' disapproval. In 1970, Billy Batts, a made man in the Gambino crime family recently released from prison, insults Tommy at a nightclub owned by Henry. In response, Tommy and Jimmy beat, stab, and fatally shoot Billy. Realizing that the unsanctioned murder of a made man would invite retribution, Jimmy, Henry, and Tommy bury the body in Upstate New York. Six months later, Jimmy learns that the burial site is slated for development, prompting them to exhume and relocate the decomposing corpse. In 1974, Karen harasses Henry\\'s mistress, Janice, and threatens Henry at gunpoint. Henry moves in with Janice, but Paulie insists that he should return to Karen after collecting a debt from a gambler in Tampa with Jimmy. Upon returning, Jimmy and Henry are arrested after being turned in by the gambler\\'s sister, an FBI typist, and receive ten-year prison sentences. Henry lives a privileged life, but must support his family on the outside by having Karen smuggle in drugs from Pittsburgh, which he sells to fellow inmates. Four years later, Henry is paroled and expands his cocaine business with Jimmy and Tommy against Paulie\\'s orders. Jimmy organizes a crew to raid the Lufthansa vault at JFK Airport, stealing six million dollars in cash and jewelry. After some members purchase expensive items against Jimmy\\'s orders and the getaway truck is found by police, he has most of the crew murdered. Only Henry and Tommy are spared, as Henry is making money through his Pittsburgh connection, and Tommy is to become a made man. However, in 1979, Tommy is murdered when he arrives at the ceremony, partly as retribution for murdering Batts. By 1980, Henry develops a cocaine habit and becomes a paranoid wreck. He sets up another drug deal with his Pittsburgh associates, but is arrested by narcotics agents and incarcerated. After bailing him out, Karen explains that she flushed $60,000 worth of cocaine down the toilet to prevent FBI agents from finding it during their raid, leaving them penniless. Feeling betrayed by Henry\\'s drug dealing, Paulie gives him $3,200 and ends their association. Karen goes to Jimmy for help, but flees when she suspects Jimmy has set a trap to murder her. Henry meets Jimmy at a diner and is asked to travel on a hit assignment, but the novelty of such a request makes him suspicious. Realizing that Jimmy also plans to have him killed, Henry finally decides to become an informant and enroll, with his family, into the witness protection program. Henry gives sufficient testimony and evidence in court to have Paulie and Jimmy convicted, and the protection program moves the Hills to a nondescript suburban neighborhood. Henry describes his unhappiness in leaving his gangster lifestyle, now condemned to live the rest of his life as a \"schnook\". The epilogue captions reveal that in 1987, Henry (while still in Witness Protection) was arrested for narcotics conspiracy and sentenced to 5 years\\' probation, but has been clean since. He and Karen separated in 1989. Paulie died in prison in 1988 while Jimmy remains in prison, ineligible for parole until 2004.",

            "plot": "Nedumaaran Rajangam, nicknamed \"Maara,\" is a former Indian Air Force Pilot Officer who dreams of starting a low-cost carrier airline. He idolises Paresh Goswami, the owner of Jaz Airlines. One day, Maara is visited by Sundari \"Bommi,\" whose family is looking for a groom for her. Bommi is a fiery young woman who wants to open her own bakery. Maara is impressed by Bommis nature and agrees to marry her. He tells her that he grew up as a rebellious boy and had a difficult and contentious relationship with his father. Maara joined the Indian Air Force, where he excelled but was often reprimanded by his superior, M. Naidu, due to his rebellious nature. When his father was on his deathbed, Maara tried to book a flight home, but he did not have enough money. He asks several people at the airport to help him out financially, but to no avail. When he reaches his house after a long journey by road and train, he discovers that his father has died and his last rites have occurred. This event sparked Maaras ambition to start a low-cost carrier airline. Bommi, however, rejects him, saying that she and Maara are already married to their respective ambitions. Maara visits Naidu to ask for the ex-serviceman loan so he can start his airline but Naidu refuses. With no other option, Maara travels on the same flight as Paresh. He proposes that they work together to start a low-cost carrier. Paresh, however, believes the poor should not travel with the rich and humiliates Maara. Prakash Babu, the head of a venture capital firm overhears Maaras conversation with Paresh and asks him to explain his business plan to the firms board. Meanwhile, Maara and Bommi start meeting each other frequently and eventually get married. He plans to lease Boeing aircraft from PlaneAm, who have agreed to lease it to them at low prices. After his funds get sanctioned, Maara tries to meet with Directorate General of Civil Aviation (India)Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) officials to acquire the license, but they disregard him. Maara then meets the President of India and requests his help in getting the license. Irked by his progress, Paresh uses his power to pass a law that requires Boeing to submit its airline blueprints to fly in Indian airspace. PlaneAm cancels the lease and demands a penalty fee. Maara requests Prakash to loan him money to pay the penalty but he refuses. Prakash reveals he was working with Paresh, with whom he conspired to bring Maara down, and that Jaz Airlines has acquired the aircraft instead. Infuriated, Maara storms into Pareshs office but is tackled by the guards. He becomes short-tempered and often quarrels with Bommi but later apologises. He realises that he can fly smaller aircraft and strikes a deal with a Turboprop aircraft manufacturer. Paresh, fearing Maara may affect his business, decides to take matters into his own hands. Meanwhile, Maaras entire village helps him by donating as much money as they can. He plans to commence flight operations from airstrips that have been abandoned since the major airports came under Pareshs control. He names his airline Simplifly DeccanDeccan Air, and sells tickets at railway stations and petrol pumps. Retired Air Force pilots are hired to fly the aircraft and Bommi wins the bid for in-flight catering. On the day of the delivery of the aircraft, Paresh uses his influence to restrict the flights landing at Chennai, forcing the flight to crash-land at Tambaram Air Force Station due to the lack of fuel. Naidu summons Maara to explain the emergency landing and lets him off with a fine. The airlines maiden flight catches fire and is forced to abort its takeoff. It is revealed that Paresh bribed the captain to sabotage the flight. The captain admits his mistakes in front of the inquiry panel. Vimal Balaiyya, a prominent businessman, offers to buy Deccan Air but Maara refuses, citing differences in their vision. Paresh starts a smear campaign against Deccan Air in the hopes of ending Maaras dreams but Maara assures everyone that his flights are safe and cost-effective. On the day of the start of operations, however, no passengers checked in for one of the flights. Maara is about to give up when he is informed that a technical error resulted in no tickets for that particular flight being booked, whereas all other flights are fully booked. With tears of happiness in his eyes, Maara watches the other flights touch down. Paresh later calls Maara and offers to work with him but Maara rejects the offer, saying farmers have flown and will continue to fly, and that Paresh does not own the sky. Paresh accepts defeat as Deccan Air becomes a success. In a mid-credits scene, the Civil Aviation Minister of India summons Paresh to Delhi, reprimands him for sabotaging Deccan Airs inaugural flight and threatens to shut down Jaz Airlines. In a restroom, Paresh has an anxiety attack and tries to take his pill but it falls to the floor. A janitor picks up the pill for Paresh, inducing in him a sense of respect for lower-income groups.",

            "plot": "On June 6, 1944, the U.S. Army lands at Omaha Beach as part of the Normandy invasion, incurring major losses against the artillery and machine gun fire of the heavily fortified German forces. Initially dazed by the chaotic battle, 2nd Ranger Battalion Captain John H. Miller takes command of a surviving group and leads a successful infiltration behind German lines to secure victory. The United States Department of War receives communication that three of four Ryan brothers have been killed in action; the last, James Francis Ryan of the 101st Airborne Division, is listed as missing. General George C. Marshall orders that Ryan be found and sent home, to spare his family the loss of all its sons. Miller is tasked with recovering Ryan and assembles a detachment of soldiers to accompany him: Mike Horvath, Richard Reiben, Adrian Caparzo, Stanley Mellish, Daniel Jackson, Irwin Wade, and interpreter Timothy Upham, who lacks any combat experience. The group tracks Ryan to the town of Neuville-au-Plain, where Caparzo is killed by a German sniper while trying to rescue a young girl. Mourning their friend, the men grow resentful at being forced to risk their lives for one man. They later find James Frederick Ryan, but realize he is the wrong man with a similar name. That evening, the men rest in a chapel, where Miller tells Horvath that his hands began uncontrollably shaking after he joined the war. The men travel to a rallying point where the 101st Airborne might be after landing off course, where they find scores of wounded and displaced soldiers. Wade admonishes Reiben, Mellish, and Jackson for callously searching through a pile of deceased soldiers dog tags in front of passing troops, hoping to find Ryans among them and conclude their mission. Remorseful for ignoring their behavior, Miller shouts for anyone who knows Ryan; one deafened soldier tells him that Ryan was reassigned to defend a vital bridge in the town of Ramelle. On the way, Miller decides to neutralize a German gun nest they discover, against the advice of his men, and although they are successful, Wade is killed. The men prepare to execute a surrendered German soldier in revenge, but Upham intervenes, arguing that they should follow the rules of war. Miller releases the soldier, nicknamed \"Steamboat Willie\", ordering that he surrender to the next Allied patrol. Discontented with the mission, Reiben threatens to desert, leading to a standoff between the men that Miller defuses by revealing his civilian background as a teacher and baseball coach, which he had always refused to disclose. Miller muses that people often guessed his career before he became a soldier, while his men could not, implying that war has changed him, and worries whether he is still the man he was and whether his wife will recognize him. In Ramelle, Millers detachment finds Ryan and informs him of their mission, but Ryan refuses to abandon his post or his fellow soldiers, believing he does not deserve to go home more than anyone else. Horvath convinces Miller that saving Ryan might be the only truly decent thing they can accomplish during the war. Miller takes command of Ryans group as the only officer present and prepares the soldiers for a German assault. Jackson and Horvath are killed, and Upham stands paralyzed with fear as Mellish is stabbed to death. Steamboat Willie returns and shoots Miller before reinforcements arrive to defeat the Germans. Upham confronts Willie, who attempts to surrender again, and kills him, before sending the other surrendering Germans away. Upham and Reiben observe as the mortally wounded Miller tells Ryan to earn the sacrifices made to send him home. Decades later, an elderly Ryan and his family visit Millers grave at the Normandy Cemetery. Ryan expresses that he remembers Millers words every day, lived his life the best he could, and hopes he has earned their sacrifices.",

            "plot": "On Christmas Eve 1945, in Bedford Falls, New York, George Bailey contemplates suicide. The prayers of his family and friends reach Heaven, where guardian angel second class Clarence Odbody is assigned to save George in order to earn his wings. Clarence is shown flashbacks of George\\'s life. He watches 12-year-old George rescue his younger brother Harry from drowning, leaving George deaf in his left ear. George later saves the pharmacist, Mr. Gower, from accidentally poisoning a customer.In 1928, George plans a world grand tour before college. He is reintroduced to Mary Hatch, who has loved him since childhood. When his father dies from a sudden stroke, George postpones his travel to settle the family business, Bailey Brothers Building and Loan. Avaricious board member Henry Potter, who owns the bank and most of the town, seeks to dissolve the company, but the board of directors votes to keep it open on condition that George run it. George acquiesces and works alongside his uncle Billy, giving his tuition savings to his younger brother Harry with the understanding that Harry will take over when he graduates.However, Harry returns from college married and with a job offer from his father-in-law, and George resigns himself to running the building and loan. George and Mary rekindle their relationship and marry, and use their honeymoon savings to keep the company solvent during a run on the bank. Under George, the company establishes Bailey Park, a housing development surpassing Potter\\'s overpriced slums. Potter entices George with a high-paying job, but George rebuffs him when he realizes that Potter\\'s true intention is to close the building and loan.On Christmas Eve, the town prepares a hero\\'s welcome for Harry, a Navy fighter pilot awarded the Medal of Honor for preventing a kamikaze attack on a troopship. Billy goes to Potter\\'s bank to deposit 8000 of the building and loan\\'s money. He taunts Potter with a newspaper headline about Harry, then absentmindedly wraps the cash in Potter\\'s newspaper. Potter finds and keeps the money, while Billy cannot recall how he misplaced it. With a bank examiner reviewing the company\\'s records, George fruitlessly retraces Billy\\'s steps. Frustrated and angered by Billy\\'s blunder, which may lead to scandal and jail, George resents the sacrifices he has made and the family that has kept him trapped in Bedford Falls. He appeals to Potter for a loan, offering his meager life insurance policy as collateral. Potter scoffs that George is worth more dead than alive, refuses to help, and phones the police.George flees Potter\\'s office, gets drunk at a bar, and prays for help. Contemplating suicide, he goes to a nearby bridge. Before George can jump, Clarence dives into the freezing river and George rescues him. When George wishes he had never been born, Clarence shows George a timeline in which he never existed. Bedford Falls is now Pottersville, an unsavory town occupied by sleazy entertainment venues and callous people. Mr. Gower was jailed for manslaughter because George was not there to stop him from poisoning the customer. George\\'s mother does not know him. Uncle Billy was institutionalized after the building and loan failed. Bailey Park is a cemetery, where George discovers Harry\\'s grave: Without George, Harry had drowned as a child, and without Harry to save them, the troops aboard the transport ship were killed. George finds that Mary is an old maid librarian. When he grabs her and claims to be her husband, she screams and runs away.George flees back to the bridge and begs for his life back. His wish granted, he rushes home to await his arrest. Meanwhile, Mary and Billy have rallied the townspeople, who donate more than enough to replace the missing money. Harry arrives and toasts George as the richest man in town. Among the donations George finds a copy of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, a gift from Clarence inscribed, Remember, no man is a failure who has friends. Thanks for the wings! When a bell on the Christmas tree rings, George\\'s youngest daughter, Zuzu, explains that every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings, while the people are singing Auld Lang Syne.",

            "plot": "In the 1980s in Boston, Irish Mob boss Frank Costello introduces himself to a young Colin Sullivan. Many years later, Sullivan has been groomed as a spy inside the Massachusetts State Police (MSP) and joins the Special Investigation Unit (SIU). Another police academy recruit, Billy Costigan, is selected by Captain Queenan and Sergeant Dignam to go undercover as a criminal. Costigan serves a term in prison for his cover and further commits several crimes. Sullivan begins dating police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden. Costigan manages to get Costello to recruit him into his organization. Over the next year, Costigan becomes increasingly involved. His mental state declines but Queenan and Dignam convince him to continue. Costigan begins seeing Madden professionally. The MSP and Costello both realize they have moles in their respective organizations and task Costigan and Sullivan to find them. Meanwhile, Costigan learns that Costello is a protected FBI informant, sharing his discovery with Queenan. He and Madden have an affair. One night, Costigan follows Costello into an adult theater and witnesses him giving Sullivan an envelope containing information of his crew. Costigan is instructed to get a visual ID of Sullivan but is unsuccessful. When Sullivan realizes he is being followed, he stabs a man, mistaking him for Costigan, and flees. Queenan suggests he follow Costello to find the MSP mole. Costigan calls Queenan and sets up a meeting to end the undercover operation, but Sullivan has Queenan followed, lying to the other officers that Queenan may be the spy. Sullivan also calls in Costello\\'s gang to the meeting. When Costello\\'s men arrive, Queenan helps Costigan escape before being thrown from the building to his death. This causes a firefight between police and Costello\\'s men. Angered by Queenan\\'s murder, Dignam attacks Sullivan and is suspended. Timothy Delahunt, one of Costello\\'s henchmen wounded in the gunfight, tells Costigan that he knows he is the mole before succumbing to his wounds. Looking through Queenan\\'s belongings, Sullivan discovers Costello is an FBI informant. A news report reveals that Delahunt was a Boston Police Department undercover officer, but Costello suspects it is a false claim so he would stop looking for the mole. Deciding to turn on him, Sullivan directs the MSP to tail Costello, and a gunfight erupts, killing most of Costello\\'s crew. Sullivan confronts a wounded Costello, who admits to being an FBI informant. They exchange gunfire, and Sullivan kills him. His assignment finished, Costigan goes to Sullivan to reveal his undercover status, unaware he is another mole. After Sullivan leaves the room, Costigan recognises the envelope from the theater on his desk. Realizing Sullivan was Costello\\'s mole, Costigan escapes. When Sullivan finds Costigan gone, he realizes he now knows his true identity so deletes Costigan\\'s records from police computers. Costigan visits Madden, who has told Sullivan but not Costigan she\\'s pregnant, knowing that Sullivan may not be the father, and hands her an envelope, instructing her to open it if something happens to him. Madden finds an envelope in the mail from Costigan to Sullivan containing a CD of Costello\\'s recorded conversations with Sullivan. Fearing Costigan has revealed their affair, she listens to it and leaves Sullivan. Costigan arranges to meet Sullivan on the same rooftop where Queenan was killed, then arrests him. Costigan calls Trooper Brown, an acquaintance from the police academy, but Brown pulls a gun on him when he arrives, unsure who to believe. Saying he has evidence tying Sullivan to Costello, Brown lets Costigan take the elevator. Upon reaching the lobby, Costigan is shot dead by Trooper Barrigan, a friend of Sullivan\\'s who is another of Costello\\'s spies. Brown reaches the lobby but is also killed by Barrigan. Sullivan shoots Barrigan dead, so that he can frame him as the mole. At Costigan\\'s funeral, as Sullivan and Madden stand by his grave, she silently cries. He realizes they were involved, but when he attempts to talk to her, she ignores him. Later, when Sullivan arrives home, Dignam is waiting for him and, after Sullivan indifferently accepts his fate, Dignam shoots him in the head, avenging both Queenan and Costigan. The final shot shows a rat crawling on the rail of the patio with the Massachusetts State House in the distance.",

            "plot": "While lying badly wounded on a ship docked in San Pedro Bay, career criminal Dean Keaton is approached by a shadowy figure whom he calls Keyser, who shoots him dead and sets fire to the ship. The next day, the police recover 27 bodies and only two survivors: Arkosh Kovash (\u00c1kos Kov\u00e1cs), a Hungarian mobster hospitalized with severe burns; and Roger Verbal Kint, a physically disabled con artist. US Customs agent Dave Kujan flies to Los Angeles from New York City to interrogate Verbal. The men are left alone in a borrowed office belonging to LAPD police sergeant Jeff Rabin while FBI agent Jack Baer visits a hospitalized Kov\u00e1cs. In an extended flashback, Verbal relates the events that led him, Keaton, and their associates onto the ship. Six weeks earlier in New York City, Keaton and Verbal are arrested alongside fellow criminals Michael McManus, Fred Fenster, and Todd Hockney and placed in a police lineup as suspects in a truck hijacking that none of them admits to participating in. As the five bond in the police station\\'s holding cell, McManus proposes that they pull a heist to get revenge on the NYPD. Trying to go straight, Keaton initially refuses but eventually agrees to help rob a jewel smuggler being escorted by corrupt cops, netting millions in emeralds, and getting over fifty cops arrested after leaking their activities to the press. They then go to California to fence the jewels through a man named Redfoot, who connects them with another jewel heist. The heist goes badly, and they\\'re forced to kill their target, who is revealed to be carrying synthetic heroin. Shortly after, the men learn that the job was arranged by a lawyer named Kobayashi, who claims to be a representative of Keyser S\u00f6ze\u2014a mysterious Turkish crime lord who passed into legend after murdering his own family while they were held hostage by his Hungarian rivals. Having vanished after killing his family and massacring his rivals, S\u00f6ze supposedly only conducts business from the shadows via his underlings, most of whom are unaware that they work for him. To most of the criminal underworld, he is a fearsome urban legend, with most unsure whether he truly exists. Kobayashi tells the men that S\u00f6ze arranged for their arrests in New York after they attracted his attention by unwittingly stealing from him, but he\\'s willing to spare their lives in exchange for them destroying a shipment of 91 million worth of cocaine being brought to San Pedro Bay by Argentinian drug dealers to be sold to a Hungarian gang. Though initially reluctant to take the job, they relent after Fenster is killed while attempting to flee, and after Kobayashi threatens their loved ones when they attempt to ambush him in his office. During Kujan\\'s interrogation, he learns that there was no cocaine on the ship, and S\u00f6ze was seen on board. At the hospital, Baer learns that Kov\u00e1cs has seen S\u00f6ze, and has a sketch artist begin making a picture of him. At the conclusion of Verbal\\'s flashback, he and his companions attack the ship and kill numerous Argentinian and Hungarian gangsters before discovering that there is no cocaine onboard. An unseen assailant kills Hockney, McManus, Keaton, and a prisoner in one of the ship\\'s cabins. The mysterious figure then sets fire to the ship as Verbal looks on from a hiding place on the dock. Kujan learns that the prisoner killed on the ship was Arturo Marquez, a smuggler who escaped prosecution by claiming that he could identify S\u00f6ze. Rather than dealing cocaine, the Argentinians were actually planning to sell Marquez\u2014the only man who could identify S\u00f6ze\u2014to his rivals. He also learns that Marquez was represented by lawyer Edie Finneran, Keaton\\'s girlfriend, who was recently murdered. Armed with this information, Kujan deduces that Keaton was actually Keyser S\u00f6ze: he organized the assault on the boat as a pretext for assassinating Marquez and faking his death. Verbal finally confesses that Keaton was behind everything, but refuses to testify in court. Verbal\\'s bail is posted, and he is released. Moments later, Kujan realizes that Verbal fabricated his entire story, improvising on the spot by piecing together details from random items in Rabin\\'s cluttered office. Verbal walks outside, gradually losing his limp and flexing his supposedly disabled hand. As Kujan pursues Verbal, a fax arrives at the police station with the sketch artist\\'s facial composite of S\u00f6ze, which resembles Verbal. Moments before Kujan arrives on the scene, Verbal enters a car driven by Kobayashi and leaves.",

            "plot": "In 2029, Earth has been ravaged by the war between the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet and the human resistance. Skynet sends the T1000an advanced, shape-shifting prototype Terminator made of virtually indestructible liquid metalback in time to kill resistance leader John Connor when he is a child. To protect Connor, the resistance sends back a reprogrammed T800 Terminator, a less advanced metal endoskeleton covered in living tissue. In 1995 Los Angeles, Johns mother Sarah is incarcerated in Pescadero State Hospital for her violent efforts to prevent Judgment Daythe prophesied events of August 29, 1997, when Skynet will gain sentience and, in response to its creators attempts to deactivate it, incite a nuclear holocaust. John, living with foster parents, also considers Sarah delusional and resents her efforts to prepare him for his future role. The T1000 locates John in a shopping mall, but the T800 intervenes, coming to Johns aid and enabling his escape. John calls to warn his foster parents, but the T800 deduces that the T1000 has already killed them. Realizing the T800 is programmed to obey him, John forbids it to kill people and orders it to save Sarah from the T1000. The T800 and John intercept Sarah as she is making an escape attempt, but Sarah flees in horror upon seeing that the T800 looks identical to the Terminator sent to kill her in 1984. John and the T800 persuade her to join them, and they escape the pursuing T1000. Although distrustful of the T800, Sarah uses its knowledge of the future to learn that a revolutionary microprocessor, being developed by Cyberdyne engineer Miles Dyson, will be crucial to Skynets creation. Over the course of their journey, Sarah sees the T800 serving as a friend and father figure to John, who teaches it catchphrases and hand signs while encouraging it to become more human-like. Sarah plans to escape to Mexico with John, but a nightmare about Judgment Day convinces her to kill Dyson. She attacks Dyson in his home but realizes she cannot bring herself to kill a person and relents. John arrives and reconciles with Sarah while the T800 convinces Dyson of the future consequences of his work. Dyson reveals that his research has been reverse engineered from the CPU and severed arm of the 1984 Terminator. Believing that his work must be destroyed, Dyson helps Sarah, John, and the T800 break into Cyberdyne, retrieve the CPU and the arm, and set explosives to destroy the lab. The police assault the building and fatally shoot Dyson, but he detonates the explosives as he dies. The T1000 pursues the surviving trio, cornering them in a steel mill. Sarah and John split up to escape while the T1000 mangles the T800 and briefly deactivates it by destroying its power source. The T1000 assumes Sarahs appearance and voice to lure out John, but Sarah intervenes and, along with the reactivated T800, pushes it into a vat of molten steel, where it disintegrates. John also throws the 1984 Terminators arm and CPU into the vat. The T800 explains that it must also be destroyed to prevent it from serving as a foundation for Skynet. Despite Johns tearful protests, the T800 persuades him that its destruction is the only way to protect their future. Sarah, having come to respect the T800, shakes its hand and lowers it into the vat. The T800 gives John a thumbs-up as it is incinerated. As Sarah drives down a highway with John, she reflects on her renewed hope for an unknown future, musing that if the T800 could learn the value of life, so can humanity",

            "plot": "In 1985, teenager Marty McFly lives in Hill Valley, California, with his depressed alcoholic mother, Lorraine; his older siblings, who are professional and social failures; and his meek father, George, who is bullied by his supervisor, Biff Tannen. After Martys band fails a music audition, he confides in his girlfriend, Jennifer Parker, that he fears becoming like his parents despite his ambitions. That night, Marty meets his eccentric scientist friend, Emmett Doc Brown, in the Twin Pines mall parking lot. Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified DeLorean, powered by plutonium he swindled from Libyan terrorists. After Doc inputs a destination time of November 5, 1955 the day he first conceived his time travel invention, the terrorists arrive unexpectedly and gun him down. Marty flees in the DeLorean, inadvertently activating time travel when he reaches 88 mph. Arriving in 1955, Marty discovers he has no plutonium, so he cannot return to 1985. While exploring a burgeoning Hill Valley, Marty encounters his teenage father and discovers Biff was bullying George even then. George falls into the path of an oncoming car while spying on the teenage Lorraine changing clothes, and Marty is knocked unconscious while saving him. He wakes to find himself tended to by Lorraine, who becomes infatuated with him. Marty tracks down and convinces a younger Doc that he is from the future, but Doc explains the only source available in 1955 capable of generating the 1.21 gigawatts of power required for time travel is a lightning bolt. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that documents an upcoming lightning strike at the towns courthouse. As Martys siblings begin to fade from a photo he carries with him, Doc realizes Martys actions are altering the future and jeopardizing his existence; Lorraine was supposed to tend to George instead of Marty after the car accident. Early attempts to get his parents acquainted fail, and Lorraines infatuation with Marty deepens. Lorraine asks Marty to the school dance, and he plots to feign inappropriate advances on her, allowing George to intervene and rescue her, but the plan goes awry when Biffs gang locks Marty in the trunk of the performing bands car, while Biff forces himself onto Lorraine. George arrives expecting to find Marty but is assaulted by Biff. After Biff hurts Lorraine, an enraged George knocks him unconscious and escorts the grateful Lorraine to the dance. The band frees Marty from their car, but the lead guitarist injures his hand in the process, so Marty takes his place, performing while George and Lorraine share their first kiss. With his future no longer in jeopardy, Marty hurries to the courthouse to meet Doc. Doc discovers a letter from Marty warning him about his future and rips it, worried about the consequences. To save Doc, Marty recalibrates the DeLorean to return ten minutes before he had left the future. The lightning strikes, sending Marty back to 1985, but the DeLorean breaks down, forcing Marty to run back to the mall. He arrives as Doc is being shot. While Marty grieves at his side, Doc sits up, revealing he had pieced Martys note back together and wore a bulletproof vest. He takes Marty home and departs to 2015 in the DeLorean. Marty wakes the next morning to discover his father is now a confident and successful science fiction author, his mother is fit and happy, his siblings are successful, and Biff is a servile valet in Georges employ. As Marty reunites with Jennifer, Doc suddenly reappears in the DeLorean, insisting they return with him to the future to save their children from terrible fates.",

However if the station was incomplete by the time the railroad reached Sweetwater the property would revert to the railroad. McBains murder puts Morton at odds with Frank who desires the land for himself. Jills unexpected appearance makes her the owner of Sweetwater as McBains surviving widow. Harmonica encounters Cheyenne now a fugitive who denies his men were sent to ambush him. Harmonica saves Jill from two of Franks men and spies out the railway carriage where Morton is confined on crutches owing to his spinal tuberculosis. Harmonica discovers the connection between Frank and Morton but is seen and captured. Frank is called away and Cheyenne rescues Harmonica. The two collaborate to help Jill save Sweetwater using stockpiled materials to start building a station. After a threatening sexual encounter with Frank Jill is forced to auction the land but Franks henchmen intimidate the bidders in order to purchase it for Frank at a low price. Harmonica appears with Cheyenne in tow and bids 5000 which is the price on Cheyenne\\'s head as a wanted fugitive. Frank is unsuccessful in buying Harmonica out and wonders why Harmonica is pursuing him. Morton bribes Franks own men to kill him but Harmonica intervenes to save Frank because of his unfinished business with him. Cheyenne escapes custody and he and his gang engage Franks remaining men in a gunfight on Morton\\'s train. Except for Cheyenne who heads to Sweetwater everyone is killed including Morton. When Frank sees the aftermath of the fight he rides to Sweetwater too where he finds Harmonica waiting. Cheyenne has arrived earlier but he remains in the ranch house with Jill. Outside Harmonica and Frank engage in a showdown. Through a flashback it is revealed that Frank had once shoved a harmonica into the mouth of a boy as he supported his older brother on his shoulders whom Frank was hanging. The boy collapsed hanging his brother. Harmonica beats Frank to the draw. As Frank lays dying Harmonica shoves the harmonica into Franks mouth triggering Franks memory of him before he dies. As Harmonica and Cheyenne leave Sweetwater together Cheyenne collapses and dies from a gut wound he received in the gunfight with Morton. Harmonica puts the body on Cheyenne\\'s horse and rides off as Jill serves water to the railroad workers.",

            "plot": "Citizens and dignitaries are assembled for the unveiling of a new monument to Peace and Prosperity. After droning speeches, the veil is lifted to reveal the Little Tramp asleep in the lap of one of the sculpted figures. After several minutes of slapstick, he manages to escape the assemblys wrath to perambulate the city. He rebukes two newsboys who taunt him for his shabbiness, and while coyly admiring a nude statue has a nearfatal encounter with a sidewalk elevator. The Tramp encounters the beautiful flower girl on a street corner and in the course of buying a flower realizes she is blind; he is instantly smitten. The girl mistakes the Tramp for a wealthy man when the door of a chauffeured automobile slams shut as he departs. That evening the Tramp saves a drunken millionaire from suicide. The millionaire takes the Tramphis new best friendback to his mansion for champagne, then after another abortive suicide attempt out for a night on the town. After helping the millionaire home the next morning, he sees the flower girl en route to her streetcorner. He gets some money from the millionaire and catches up to the girl; he buys all her flowers and drives her home in the millionaires car. The millionaires car is a right hand drive RollsRoyce 4050 hp from 1924. After the Tramp leaves, the flower girl tells her grandmother about her kind and wealthy friend. Meanwhile, the Tramp returns to the mansion, where the millionairennow soberdoes not remember him and throws him out. Later that day, the millionaire is once again intoxicated and, seeing the Tramp on the street, invites him home for a lavish party. But the next morning history repeats itself: the millionaire is again sober and the Tramp is again out on his ear. Finding that the girl is not at her usual streetcorner, the Tramp goes to her apartment, where he overhears a doctor tell the grandmother that the girl is very ill: She has a fever and needs careful attention. Determined to help, the Tramp takes a job as a street sweeper. On his lunch break, he brings the girl groceries while her grandmother is out selling flowers. To entertain her he reads a newspaper aloud; in it is a story about a Viennese doctors blindness cure. Wonderful, then Ill be able to see you, says the girl and the Tramp is struck by what may happen should she gain her sight and discover that he is not the wealthy man she imagines. He also finds an eviction notice the girls grandmother has hidden. As he leaves, he promises the girl that he will pay the rent. The Tramp returns to work to find himself firedhe has been late once too often. A boxer convinces him to fight in a fake bout; they will go easy on each other and split the prize money. But the boxer flees on learning he is about to be arrested and is replaced by a no nonsense fighter who knocks the Tramp out despite the Tramps creative and nimble efforts to keep out of reach. The Tramp encounters the drunken millionaire a third time and is again invited to the mansion. The Tramp relates the girls plight and the millionaire gives him money for her operation. Burglars knock the millionaire out and take the rest of his money. The police find the Tramp with the money given to him by the millionaire, who because of the knock on the head does not remember giving it. The Tramp evades the police long enough to get the money to the girl, telling her he will be going away for a time; in due course he is apprehended and imprisoned. Months later the Tramp is released. He goes to the girls customary street corner but she is not there. We learn that the girlher sight restorednow runs a busy flower shop with her grandmother. But she has not forgotten her mysterious benefactor, whom she imagines to be rich and handsome: when an elegant young man enters the shop she wonders for a moment whether he has returned. The Tramp happens by the shop, where the girl is arranging flowers in the window. He stoops to retrieve a flower discarded in the gutter. After a brief skirmish with his old nemeses, the newsboys, he turns to the shops window through which he suddenly sees the girl, who has been watching him without of course knowing who he is. At the sight of her he is frozen for a few seconds, then breaks into a broad smile. The girl is flattered and giggles to her employee, Ive made a conquest Via pantomime through the glass she offers him a fresh flower to replace the crushed one he took from the gutter and a coin. Suddenly embarrassed, the Tramp begins to shuffle away, but the girl steps to the shop door and again offers the flower, which he shyly accepts. She takes his hand and presses the coin into it, then abruptly stops; her smile turns to a look of puzzlement as she recognizes the touch of his hand. She runs her fingers along his arm, his shoulder, his lapels, then gasps, You The Tramp nods and asks, You can see now The girl replies, Yes, I can see now, and presses his hand to her heart with a tearful smile. Relieved and elated, the Tramp smiles back.",

            "plot": "Vikram is an honest police inspector who has a blackandwhite sense of good and evil. Vedha is a dreaded gangster who understands the nuances in between. Vikrams best friend Simon leads an encounter unit formed to eliminate Vedha. In one encounter, the squad kills some of Vedhas henchmen, framing an unarmed criminal killed by Vikram to avoid further inquiry. As the unit plans another encounter, Vedha enters the police station and voluntarily surrenders. When Vikram interrogates Vedha, he offers to narrate a story to him. The first act relates about Vedha becoming a drug smuggler, who warns his younger brother Vignesh, nicknamed Pulli skilled due to his exceptional mathematical skills, to stay away from crime, but Pulli is forced by a rival gangster Ravi, to carry drugs. When Pulli and his friend Chandra are caught by the police, Pulli confesses and Ravi is arrested immediately. On his boss Sangu\\'s orders, Ravi assaults Pulli, leaving a permanent scar on his hand. Vedha asks Vikram if he should kill Ravi or Sangu. Vikram replies that Sangu was the real culprit and that Ravi is just a weapon, to which Vedha wholeheartedly agrees and implies that he killed Sangu. Vedhas lawyer, who turns out to be Vikrams wife, Priya, intervenes and bails him out. Vikram realises that the unarmed criminal framed by them, for avoiding inquiry, was actually Pulli, based on the mark in his hand. Worried that Vedha might try to kill Simon, Vikram rushes to save Simon, but finds him and Chandra shot dead. SP Surendhar dismisses it as a botched encounter. Priya refuses to divulge Vedhas whereabouts to Vikram. Enraged by this, Vikram raids Vedhas tenements and manages to capture him. Vedha requests Vikram to listen to another story. The second story relates with Pulli, now grownup, offering to launder Vedhas income by investing it in shares. Vedhas boss Cheta invests in this venture. However, Chandra is supposedly kidnapped and the money is missing. Chandra returns and reveals that she stole the money to start a new life, but came back because she loves Pulli. Vedha returns the money to Cheta, who orders him to kill Chandra. Vedha asks Vikram if he should respect Cheta and carry out the order or disobey him and support Pulli and Chandra, thus inciting a gang war. Vikram replies that he should support Pulli, to which Vedha agrees. Realising Pullis innocence causes Vikram to stumble momentarily, Vedha attacks and subdues him, telling him to investigate Simon and Pullis deaths. Vikram begins his investigation with Simons informant, Kaattai, who led them to Pullis hideout, but finds that Kaattai has been killed. Vikram and his unit try to find the killer, where he takes a moment to recollect and finds one of the members of the Kerala Quotation Gang from Vedhas story. Vikram apprehends and fights him, only for the gang member to almost kill Vikram before getting shot and killed by his unit member Santhanam. Vikram searches his room, but finds a cigar and learns that the cigarette is filled with marijuana instead of tobacco. Vikram deduces that Ravi is behind the encounter and informs Vedha at his restaurant, who brings Ravi to an abandoned factory. Vikram arrives and meets Vedha, who tells Vikram the third and final act. Vedha had sent Pulli and Chandra to Mumbai. He noticed that only his men, except Chetas, were being targeted and eliminated by the police. On Ravis confession, Vedha says that Simon was bribed by Ravi to kill his men. Vedha asks Vikram if Simon was right, since he became corrupt to pay for his sons medical procedure. Vedha kills Ravi, leaving Vikram frustrated on finding out who had killed Simon. Surendhar and the unit arrive, where he castigates Vikram for letting Vedha escape again. Vikram slowly realises that the entire unit had also been bribed by Ravi. Surendhar reveals that Ravi paid them to kill Vedha and Chandras abduction was intended to get Pulli out of Mumbai, which would lure Vedha out of hiding. However, a guiltridden Simon had gone to save Chandra, but the unit had killed them both. As the unit prepares to kill Vikram, Vedha reappears and saves him. A gunfight ensues, and Vikram disables all his colleagues with Vedhas help, but kills Surendhar. Vikram asks Vedha if he should let him go for saving his life or kill him since he is a criminal. The film ends with a standoff between them.",

            "plot": "In 2018, 23 days after Thanos erased half of all life in the universe, Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space. They reunite with the remaining Avengers\u2014Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes\u2014and Rocket on Earth. Locating Thanos on an uninhabited planet, they plan to use the Infinity Stones to reverse his actions but find that Thanos has destroyed them. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos. Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm. Reaching the Avengers Compound, he explains that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing that the Quantum Realm allows time travel, they ask a reluctant Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse Thanoss present actions. Stark, Rocket, and Banner, who has merged his intelligence with the Hulks strength, build a time machine. Banner notes that altering the past does not affect the present; any changes create alternate realities. Banner and Rocket travel to Norway, where they visit the Asgardian refugee settlement of New Asgard and recruit an overweight, despondent Thor. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, who became a vigilante after the erasure of his family. Banner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark time-travel to New York City during Lokis attack in 2012. At the Sanctum Sanctorum, Banner convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone after promising to return the Infinity Stones to their proper points in time. At Stark Tower, Rogers retrieves the Mind Stone from Hydra sleeper agents; Stark and Langs attempt to steal the Space Stone fails, allowing 2012-Loki to escape with it. Rogers and Stark travel to Camp Lehigh in 1970, where Stark obtains an earlier version of the Space Stone and encounters his father, Howard. Rogers steals Pym Particles from Hank Pym to return to the present and sees his lost love, Peggy Carter. Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013; Rocket extracts the Reality Stone from Jane Foster. Thor is encouraged by his mother, Frigga, and retrieves his old hammer, Mjolnir. Barton, Romanoff, Nebula, and Rhodes travel to 2014; Nebula and Rhodes go to Morag and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill can, while Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir. The Soul Stones keeper, Red Skull, says that it can only be acquired by sacrificing a loved one. Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to get the Stone. Rhodes and Nebula attempt to return to their own time, but Nebula is incapacitated when her cybernetic implants link with her past self; this allows 2014-Thanos to learn about his future selfs success and the Avengers attempt to undo it. 2014-Thanos sends 2014-Nebula forward in time to prepare for his arrival. Reuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet that Stark, Banner, and Rocket have built. Banner, who has the most resistance to their radiation, uses the gauntlet to undo Thanos disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula impersonating her future self uses the time machine to transport 2014-Thanos and his warship to the present and destroys the Avengers Compound. Present-day Nebula convinces 2014-Gamora to betray Thanos, but is unable to convince 2014-Nebula and kills her. Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers; he summons his army to retrieve the Stones, intent on using them to destroy the universe and create a new one. A restored Stephen Strange arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos army. Danvers also arrives and destroys Thanos warship, but Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Stark steals the Stones and uses them to disintegrate Thanos and his army, sacrificing himself. After Starks funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new king of New Asgard and joins the Guardians. Rogers returns the Stones and Mjolnir to their proper timelines and remains in the past to live with Carter. In the present, an elderly Rogers passes his shield to Sam Wilson.",

            "plot": "In 1858 Texas, brothers Ace and Dicky Speck drive a group of shackled black slaves. Among them is Django, sold off and separated from his wife Broomhilda von Shaft, a house slave who speaks German and English. They are stopped by Dr. King Schultz, a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter seeking to buy Django for his knowledge of the three outlaw Brittle brothers. They were overseers at the plantation of Django\\'s previous owner and Schultz has a warrant for their arrests. Ace refuses to sell Django to Schultz and threatens him. Schultz kills Ace and shoots Dicky\\'s horse to pin him to the ground. He encourages the freed slaves to take revenge, and they shoot Dicky to death. Schultz offers Django his freedom and $75 in exchange for help tracking down the Brittles. Django and Schultz kill the Brittle brothers at Spencer Big Daddy Bennett\\'s Tennessee plantation. In turn, Bennett pursues them with an armed posse. Schultz ambushes the posse with explosives, and Django kills Bennett. Feeling responsible for Django, Schultz agrees to help him find and rescue Broomhilda, and Schultz trains Django to become a bounty hunter. They return to Texas, where Django collects his first bounty, keeping the handbill as a memento and for good luck. He and Schultz rack up several bounties before spring when they travel to Mississippi and learn that Broomhilda\\'s new owner is Calvin J. Candie, owner of the Candyland plantation. There, he forces male slaves to wrestle to the death in brutal Mandingo fights. Schultz and Django hatch a plan: deciding that Candie will refuse to sell Broomhilda if they try to buy her upfront, they will instead offer 12000 for one of his best fighters as a pretext to acquire Broomhilda for a nominal sum. They intend to leave the plantation with Broomhilda under the pretense of returning with the purchase money for a fighter. They meet Candie at his gentlemen\\'s club and make the offer. Intrigued, Candie invites them to Candyland. En route, the group encounters Candie\\'s slave trackers, who have cornered D\\'Artagnan, an escaped Mandingo fighter. Django is forced to intervene when Schultz attempts to buy D\\'Artagnan to save him. Candie has the trackers\\' guard dogs maul D\\'Artagnan to death, visibly upsetting Schultz. Having told Broomhilda of their plan, Schultz offers to buy her as his escort while negotiating the initial Mandingo deal during dinner. Candie\\'s loyal house slave Stephen is suspicious after realizing that Broomhilda and Django know each other. He deduces their plan and alerts Candie. Enraged, Candie tells Schultz at gunpoint that he won\\'t sell Broomhilda for less than $12,000; Schultz reluctantly agrees. Candie threatens to kill Broomhilda if Schultz does not shake his hand to seal the deal. Having had enough of Candie\\'s arrogance, Schultz shoots and kills Candie. Butch Pooch, Candie\\'s bodyguard, kills Schultz, and Django kills Pooch, Candie\\'s lawyer Leonide Moguy, and many of Candie\\'s henchmen in a prolonged gunfight. He is forced to surrender when Broomhilda is taken hostage. The next morning, the chained Django is tortured and about to be castrated by overseer Billy Crash when Stephen arrives, informing him that Candie\\'s sister Lara, who has taken charge of the plantation, has ordered him to be sold to a mining company and worked to death. En route to the mines along with other slaves, Django devises an escape plan. He uses his first handbill to prove to his escorts that he is a bounty hunter. He claims that the men on the handbill are at Candyland, and promises the escorts a share of the reward money. Once released and handed a gun, Django immediately kills his escorts, retrieves his clothes and weapons, and returns to Candyland with dynamite. Recovering Broomhilda\\'s freedom papers from Schultz\\'s corpse, Django bids his deceased mentor goodbye and avenges him and D\\'Artagnan by killing the trackers. He frees Broomhilda just as Candie\\'s mourners return from his burial. At the mansion, Django kills Lara, Crash, and the remaining henchmen, releases the two remaining house slaves, and kneecaps Stephen before igniting the dynamite he had planted throughout the mansion, leaving him for dead. Django and Broomhilda watch from a distance as the mansion explodes before riding off together.",

            "plot": "Bane, a former member of the League of Shadows, leads an attack on a CIA plane over Uzbekistan to abduct nuclear physicist Dr. Leonid Pavel and fake Pavel's death in the crash. Meanwhile, eight years after the death of Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent and the arrest of the Joker, organized crime has been eradicated in Gotham by the Dent Act, legislation that gives expanded powers to the police. Police commissioner James Gordon has kept Dent's killing spree a secret and allowed the blame for his crimes to fall on Batman. Bruce Wayne, still mourning the death of Rachel Dawes, has become a recluse, and Wayne Enterprises has stagnated. Bane conspires to help Wayne Enterprises board member John Daggett take over the company, and they begin by trying to buy Bruce's fingerprints. Burglar Selina Catwoman Kyle steals Bruce's prints from Wayne Manor for Daggett, but he double-crosses her, and she alerts the police, who pursue Bane and Daggett's henchmen into the sewers while Catwoman flees. The henchmen capture Gordon and take him to Bane, but he escapes and is found by Officer John Blake, an orphan who has deduced Bruce's secret identity and persuades him to resume his vigilantism. Bane attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange and uses Bruce's fingerprints to verify a series of fraudulent transactions, leaving Bruce ousted from his company and bankrupt. Batman resurfaces to pursue Bane's henchmen. Fearing Bruce will get himself killed fighting Bane, his butler, Alfred Pennyworth, resigns in the hope of saving him after admitting to burning a letter that Rachel left for him saying she was going to marry Dent. Bane expands his operations and kills Daggett while Bruce and Wayne Enterprises' new CEO, Miranda Tate, become lovers. Catwoman agrees to take Batman to Bane but instead leads him into a trap under Wayne Tower. Bane gloats that he intends to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's mission to destroy Gotham City before he brutally cripples Batman in combat. He then takes Bruce to an ancient underground prison in the Middle East, where Bruce learns that Ra's al Ghul's child was born and raised in the prison but had a protector that aided the child in escaping, thought to be impossible. Back in Gotham, Bane traps the police forces in the sewers, destroys all but one bridge surrounding the city, kills Mayor Anthony Garcia, and forces Pavel to convert the fusion reactor core owned by Wayne Enterprises into a decaying neutron bomb before publicly killing him. He exposes Dent's crimes to the city and releases the prisoners of Blackgate Penitentiary, taking over the city, and has Gotham's elite exiled and killed in proletarian kangaroo courts presided over by Jonathan Crane. Five months later, Bruce escapes captivity and returns to Gotham. As Batman, he frees the police, and together, they clash with Bane's army in the streets. During the battle, Batman overpowers Bane, but Tate stabs Batman in the abdomen, revealing herself as Ra's al Ghul's daughter Talia al Ghul. Talia also reveals that Bane was her protector in the pit before activating the bomb's detonator, but it fails due to Gordon blocking the signal, so Talia leaves to find the bomb while entrusting Bane to finish off Batman. However, Catwoman returns, killing Bane and helping Batman pursue Talia, hoping to return the bomb to the reactor chamber where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely floods and destroys the reactor chamber before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman, after revealing his identity to Gordon, uses his aerial craft, the Bat, to haul the bomb far over the bay, where it safely explodes. In the aftermath, Batman is presumed dead and honored as a hero. Wayne Manor becomes an orphanage, and Bruce's estate is left to Alfred. Gordon finds the Bat Signal repaired, while Lucius Fox discovers that Bruce had fixed the Bat's malfunctioning auto-pilot. In Florence, Alfred discovers that Bruce is alive and in a relationship with Selina, and they silently acknowledge each other before parting ways. Blake, whose legal first name is revealed as Robin, resigns from the GCPD and receives a package leading him to the Batcave.",

            "plot": "Ishaan is an 8yearold boy living in Mumbai, who has trouble following school. He is assumed by all to simply hate learning and deemed a troublemaker, and is belittled for it. He has even repeated the 3rd standard due to his academic failures from the previous year. Ishaans imagination, creativity, and talent for art and painting are often disregarded. Ishaans father, Nandkishore Awasthi, is a successful executive who expects his sons to excel and his mother, Maya, is a homemaker who is frustrated by her inability to educate Ishaan. His elder brother Yohaan is an exemplary student and athlete in whose shadow Ishaan remains, though he is the most supportive of Ishaan. One day his parents are called by the principal to discuss his behavior and grades. Fed up with Ishaans failures, lack of improvement, and rebellious behavior, Nandkishore sends him to a boarding school despite Maya and Yohans protests. Alone there, Ishaan rapidly sinks into a state of fear, anxiety and depression, which is only worsened by the teachers strict and abusive regime. Ishaans only friend is Rajan Damodaran, a physically disabled boy who is one of the top students and resides with his family there, as his father is part of the schools board. Ishaan contemplates suicide one day, but is stopped thanks to Rajans interference. Rajan subsequently informs Ishaan that Mr Holkar, the boarding schools art teacher, has left and is being replaced by someone else. Ram Shankar Nikumbh, a cheerful and optimistic instructor at the Tulips School for young children with developmental disabilities, joins as the boarding schools temporary art teacher the same day, replacing Mr Holkar. Rams teaching style is markedly different from Holkars, and Ram quickly notes Ishaans unhappiness after Ishaan fails to draw anything during the class. Ram reviews Ishaans work and concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of dyslexia. Ram then visits Ishaans house in Mumbai, where Ram is surprised to discover Ishaans hidden interest in art. Flustered, Ram demonstrates to Maya and Yohaan how Ishaan has extreme difficulty in understanding letters and words due to dyslexia and his poverty in sports skills stems from his poor motor ability which also applies to his difficulty in tying shoelaces and judging the size, speed and distance of a ball. Nandkishore labels it as an intellectual disability as well as excuse and dismisses it as laziness, much to Rams frustration. Back at school, Ram brings up the topic of dyslexia in a class by offering a list of famous dyslexic people. Ram comforts Ishaan, telling him how he struggled as a child as well. Ram obtains the principals permission to become Ishaans tutor. With gradual care, Ram works to improve Ishaans reading and writing by using remedial techniques developed by dyslexia specialists. Eventually, both Ishaans demeanor and grades improve. One day, Nandkishore visits the school and tells Ram that he and Maya have read up on dyslexia and understand the condition. Ram mentions that what Ishaan needs more than understanding is that someone loves him. Outside, Nandkishore sees Ishaan attempting to read from a board. With teary eyes, Nandkishore is unable to face Ishaan and he walks away. At the end of the school year, Ram organises an arts and crafts contest for the staff and students, judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaans work makes him the winner and Ram, who paints Ishaans portrait, is declared the runnerup. The principal announces that Ram has been hired as the boarding schools permanent art teacher. When Ishaans parents meet Ishaans teachers on the last day of school, they are left speechless by the transformation within him. Overcome with emotion, Nandkishore thanks Ram. Before leaving, Ishaan runs toward Ram, who lifts him high up in a hug, advising him to come back next year.",

            "plot": "In 1984 East Germany GDR, Stasi Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler, code name HGW XX7, is ordered by his friend and superior, Lt. Col. Anton Grubitz, to spy on playwright Georg Dreyman, whose procommunist politics and international recognition have so far kept the state from directly monitoring him. Dreyman\\'s very appearance as a model East German mystifies Wiesler; the playwright has no known vices or record of disloyalty or dissent at all. At the request of Minister of Culture Bruno Hempf, Wiesler and his team bug Dreyman\\'s apartment, set up surveillance equipment, and report Dreyman\\'s activities. Wiesler is disappointed to discover that Hempf is having Dreyman observed not for suspicions of disloyalty or dissent, but for his own romantic interest in Dreyman\\'s girlfriend, actress ChristaMaria Sieland. After an intervention by Wiesler leads to Dreyman\\'s discovering Sieland\\'s relationship with Hempf, he implores her not to meet him again and to be true to herself. She reconciles with Dreyman. Dreyman\\'s friend Albert Jerska, a blacklisted theatrical director, gives him sheet music for Sonata vom Guten Menschen Sonata about a Good Man. Shortly afterwards, Jerska hangs himself. Dreyman realises that the GDR has not published its own suicide rates since 1977, and decides to publish an article in Western media. To determine whether or not his flat is bugged, Dreyman and his friends feign a defection attempt. A sympathetic Wiesler does not report it and the conspirators believe they are safe. Since all East German typewriters are registered and identifiable, an editor of prominent West German newsweekly Der Spiegel smuggles Dreyman a Groma B\u00fcromaschinen Kolibri, an ultra flat typewriter, which he hides under a floorboard. It has only a red ribbon, which stains his fingers. Dreyman publishes an anonymous article in Der Spiegel accusing the state of concealing the country\\'s elevated suicide rates. The article angers the East German authorities but the Stasi cannot link it to a registered typewriter. Rejected by Sieland, Hempf orders Grubitz to arrest her. She is blackmailed into revealing Dreyman\\'s authorship of the article, although the Stasi do not find the typewriter. Grubitz, suspicious of Wiesler, has him do the follow up interrogation of Sieland. Wiesler makes Sieland reveal the typewriter\\'s location. When the Stasi return to Dreyman\\'s apartment, Sieland realises that Dreyman will know she betrayed him and runs into the street right in front of a passing truck. Dreyman runs after her and Sieland dies in his arms. Grubitz finds nothing beneath the floorboard; he ends the investigation with a perfunctory apology to Dreyman. Grubitz then informs Wiesler that while the investigation is over, so is Wiesler\\'s career; his remaining years with the Stasi will be steam opening letters for inspection in Department M, a dead end assignment for disgraced agents. The same day, Mikhail Gorbachev is elected leader of the Soviet Union. Two years after the fall of the wall, Hempf and Dreyman meet at a performance of Dreyman\\'s play, each reflecting on life before and after German reunification. Dreyman asks why he was never monitored by the Stasi, to which Hempf replies that he had been We knew everything. Dreyman finds the abandoned listening devices in his apartment and rips them from the walls. Dreyman reviews his Stasi files at the Stasi Records Agency, reading that Sieland was released just before the second search and could not have removed the typewriter. He is confused by other contradictions until, seeing a red fingerprint in the final report, he realises that the officer in charge of his surveillanceStasi officer HGW XX7had removed the typewriter from his apartment and concealed his activities, including his authorship of the suicide article. He tracks down Wiesler, who now works as a mailman, but ultimately decides not to approach him. Two years later, Wiesler passes a bookstore window display promoting Dreyman\\'s new novel, Sonata vom Guten Menschen Sonata about a Good Man. He opens a copy of the book, discovering that it is dedicated To HGW XX7, in gratitude. As he buys a copy, Wiesler is asked if he would like it giftwrapped. He replies No, it\\'s for me.",

Due to his socialization as a gangster, Deborah sees no future for their love. Bugsy, now a rival, ambushes the gang and fatally shoots Dominic. Noodles kills Bugsy and is sentenced to prison. Upon his release a decade later, Noodles rejoins his gang. During a diamond heist they use jewellery employee Carol as their informant. She goads Noodles into hitting her, after which he rapes her; she later becomes Max\\'s girlfriend. Noodles realizes that the heist was commissioned by a syndicate figure to eliminate competition. This leads to tensions between Max and Noodles, who seeks independence. The gang provides protection for Teamsters union boss O\\'Donnell, during the course of which they exchange newborns at a clinic, punishing the head of the police whose wife has just given birth to a boy at that clinic. This results in the police withdrawing their actions against striking workers. Noodles takes Deborah on a lavish date. When she reveals her plans to pursue a career in Hollywood, he snaps and rapes her. As she departs the next day, he attempts to catch a glance of her sitting on the train, but she avoids eye contact. The repeal of Prohibition forces the gang to look for alternative activities. Max suggests a New York Federal Reserve Bank heist, which Noodles and Carol deem too risky. Carol convinces Noodles to inform the police about a lesser offense, hoping brief incarceration will cool off Max\\'s ambition. After Noodles calls the police, Max knocks him out. Upon regaining consciousness, Noodles learns that Max, Patsy, and Cockeye have been killed by the police during the heist, as established at the beginning of the film. A guilt-ridden Noodles hides in the opium den. During his subsequent escape, he realizes the locker money has disappeared. In the 1960s, Noodles returns to Manhattan for the first time since the 1930s after receiving a letter indicating that his identity has been uncovered, seeking to find out who is responsible. He learns that the bodies of his three friends have been relocated to Riverdale. He visits their mausoleum in Riverdale and finds a key to a railway locker. The locker reveals a suitcase full of money, stated to be the advance on his next job. Noodles learns of the corruption scandals around Senator Christopher Bailey and visits Carol in a retirement home run by the Bailey Foundation. She tells him that Max manipulated them into tipping him off to the police and that Max opened fire first, wishing to die young. Noodles spots Deborah in a memorial photograph, who has become a major actress, and starts to suspect a connection between Deborah and Bailey. He tracks down Deborah and visits her, telling her about his invitation to a party at Bailey\\'s mansion and challenging her to tell him about the mysterious job as well as the identity of Bailey. Deborah admits to being Bailey\\'s lover and begs Noodles to leave the city before facing hurtful revelations. Ignoring her advice, Noodles leaves her after seeing Bailey\\'s son, who looks like the young Max. Noodles meets Bailey, who turns out to be Max. Having faked his death, Max stole the gang\\'s money and reinvented himself as a self-made business man. He also made Deborah his mistress, thus robbing Noodles of everything he had. Faced with ruin due to the corruption scandal, Max reveals that he is behind the mysterious job, which is for Noodles to kill him. Noodles refuses. As Noodles leaves the estate, a garbage truck passes and a man, presumably Max, walks toward Noodles until the truck passes between them. Noodles sees the truck\\'s auger conveyor grinding garbage, but the man is nowhere to be seen.",

            "plot": "In 1936, American archaeologist Indiana Jones recovers a Golden Idol from a booby-trapped Peruvian temple. Rival archaeologist Ren\u00e9 Belloq corners him and steals the idol; Jones escapes in a waiting float plane. After returning to the United States, Jones is briefed by two Army Intelligence agents that Nazi German forces are excavating at Tanis, Egypt, and one of their telegrams mentions Jones former mentor Abner Ravenwood. Jones deduces that the Nazis are seeking the Ark of the Covenant, which Adolf Hitler believes will make their army invincible. The agents recruit Jones to recover the Ark first.At a bar in Nepal, Jones reunites with Abners daughter Marion, with whom Jones once had an illicit relationship, and learns that Abner is dead. The bar is set ablaze during a scuffle with Gestapo agent Arnold Toht, who arrives to take a medallion from Marion. Toht attempts to recover the medallion from the flames, but only burns its image into his hand. Jones and Marion safely take the medallion and escape.Traveling to Cairo, the pair meet Joness friend Sallah. Sallah reveals Belloq is assisting the Nazis, who have fashioned an incomplete replica medallion from the burns on Tohts hand. Nazi soldiers and mercenaries attack Jones, and Marion is seemingly killed, leaving Jones despondent. An imam deciphers the medallion for Jones, revealing that one side bears a warning against disturbing the Ark, and the other bears the complete measurements for the staff of Ra, an item used to locate the Ark. Jones and Sallah realize that the Nazis are digging in the wrong location, infiltrate the Nazi dig site, and use the medallion and the correctly sized staff of Ra to locate the Well of Souls, the Arks resting place. They recover the Ark, a golden, intricately decorated chest, but Belloq and the Nazis discover them and seize it. Jones and Marion, whom Belloq has held captive, are sealed inside the well, but the pair escape and Jones captures a truck carrying the Ark. Alongside Marion, Jones arranges to transport the Ark to London aboard a tramp steamer. A German U-boat intercepts the steamer and seizes the Ark and Marion; Jones covertly boards the U-boat. The vessel travels to an island in the Aegean Sea, where Belloq intends to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to Hitler.On the island, Jones ambushes the Nazi group and threatens to destroy the Ark but surrenders after Belloq deduces that Jones would never destroy something so historically significant, also surmising that Jones wants to know if the Arks power is real. The Nazis restrain Jones and Marion at the testing site as Belloq ceremonially opens the Ark but finds only sand inside. At Joness instruction, he and Marion close their eyes to avoid looking at the opened Ark, as it releases spirits, flames, and bolts of energy that kill Belloq, Toht, and the assembled Nazis before sealing itself shut. Jones and Marion open their eyes to find the area cleared of bodies and their bindings removed.Back in Washington, D.C., the United States government rewards Jones for securing the Ark. Despite Joness insistence, the agents state only that the Ark has been moved to an undisclosed location for top men to study. In a vast warehouse, the Ark is crated up and stored among countless other crates.",

            "plot": "In 1969 during the Vietnam War, jaded MACV-SOG operative Captain Benjamin L. Willard is summoned to I Field Force headquarters in Nha Trang. The officers there tell him that U.S. Army Special Forces Colonel Walter E. Kurtz is waging a brutal war against NVA, Viet Cong, and Khmer Rouge forces without permission from his commanders. He is based at a remote jungle outpost in eastern Cambodia, where he commands American, Montagnard, and local Khmer militia troops. These troops view him as a demigod. Willard is ordered to terminate Kurtz\\'s command with extreme prejudice. He joins a U.S. Navy river patrol boat (PBR) commanded by Chief Petty Officer Phillips, with crewmen Lance, Chef, and Mr. Clean to quietly navigate up the N\u00f9ng River to Kurtz\\'s outpost.Before reaching the coastal mouth of the N\u00f9ng, they rendezvous with the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment\u2014a helicopter-borne air assault unit of the elite 1st Cavalry Division, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore\u2014to discuss safe entry into the river. Kilgore is initially inattentive, as he has not received word about their mission through normal channels. However, he becomes more engaged after discovering that Lance is a well-known surfer. Kilgore, an avid surfer himself, agrees to escort them through the N\u00f9ng\\'s Viet Cong-held coastal mouth. The helicopter squadron, playing Ride of the Valkyries on loudspeakers, raids at dawn with a napalm strike.Resisting Kilgore\u2019s attempts to convince Lance to surf with him on the newly conquered beach, Willard gathers the sailors to board the PBR and continue on their mission. Tension arises as Willard insists on the priority of his mission over the Chief\\'s usual patrol objectives.Slowly making their way upriver, Willard partially reveals his orders to the Chief to convince him that the mission is important and should proceed despite the difficulties they\u2019ve encountered. As Willard studies Kurtz\\'s dossier, he is struck by the mid-career sacrifice Kurtz made by leaving a prestigious Pentagon assignment to join Special Forces, with no prospect of advancing beyond the rank of colonel.At a remote U.S. Army outpost, Willard and Lance seek information on what is upriver and receive a dispatch bag containing official and personal mail. Unable to find any commanding officer, Willard orders the Chief to continue. Willard learns via the dispatch that another MACV-SOG operative, Special Forces Captain Richard Colby, was sent on an earlier mission identical to Willard\\'s and has since joined Kurtz.Lance activates a smoke grenade while under the influence of LSD, attracting enemy fire, causing Mr. Clean\\'s death. Further upriver, the Chief is impaled by a spear thrown by Montagnards and attempts to kill Willard with the spear point protruding from his chest, but Willard overpowers him.Willard reveals his mission to Chef, who is now in charge of the PBR. The PBR arrives at Kurtz\\'s outpost, a Khmer temple teeming with Montagnards and strewn with remains of victims. Willard, Chef, and Lance are greeted by an American photojournalist, who praises Kurtz\\'s genius. Willard encounters Colby and two other soldiers among the Montagnards. He sets out with Lance to find Kurtz, leaving Chef with orders to call in an airstrike on the outpost if the two do not return.In the camp, Willard is bound and brought before Kurtz, after which he is locked in a bamboo cage. One night Kurtz appears and drops Chef\\'s severed head into Willard\\'s lap. Willard is released, and warned not to attempt escape from the camp or he will be shot. Kurtz lectures him on his theories of war, praising the ruthlessness of the Viet Cong, and asks him to tell his son the truth about his mutiny. Later, as the Montagnards ceremonially kill a water buffalo, Willard assassinates Kurtz with a machete. Everyone in the camp sees Willard departing, carrying a collection of Kurtz\\'s writings, and bow down to him. Willard finds Lance, leads him back to the PBR, and they depart back down the river, away from Kurtz\u2019s outpost.",

            "plot": "In 1916, during World War I in Northern France, French Major General Georges Broulard orders his subordinate, Brigadier General Paul Mireau, to take the Anthill, a well-defended German position. Mireau refuses, citing the impossibility of success. However, when Broulard mentions a potential promotion, Mireau quickly convinces himself that the attack will succeed.In the trenches, Mireau throws a private out of the regiment for showing signs of shell shock. Mireau leaves the planning of the attack to Colonel Dax, despite Dax\u2019s protests that the result will weaken the French Army.Before the attack, drunken Lieutenant Roget leads a night-time scouting mission, sending one of his two men ahead. Overcome by fear while waiting for the man\u2019s return, Roget lobs a grenade, accidentally killing the scout. Corporal Paris, the other soldier on the mission, confronts Roget, who denies any wrongdoing and falsifies his report to Colonel Dax.The next morning, the attack on the Anthill is a failure. Dax leads the first wave of soldiers over the top into no man\u2019s land under heavy rifle and machine gun fire. None of the men reach the German trenches, and B Company refuses to leave their trench after seeing that defeat. Mireau orders his artillery to open fire on them to force them onto the battlefield. The artillery commander refuses to fire without written confirmation of the order.To deflect blame for the attack\u2019s failure, Mireau decides to court-martial 100 of the soldiers for cowardice. Broulard orders Mireau to reduce the number and Mireau arrives at three, one from each company. Corporal Paris is chosen because his commanding officer Roget wishes to keep him from testifying about what happened in the scouting mission. Private Ferol is picked by his commanding officer because he is a \u201csocial undesirable\u201d. Private Arnaud is chosen at random.Dax, a criminal defense lawyer in civilian life, volunteers to defend the men at their court-martial. The trial, however, is a farce. There is no formal written indictment, a court stenographer is not present, and the court refuses to admit evidence that would support acquittal. In his closing statement, Dax angrily denounces the proceedings. Later, in a meeting with Broulard, Dax informs him that Mireau had ordered the artillery to fire onto French trenches to dislodge the soldiers refusing to attack. Nonetheless, the three are sentenced to death and shot by firing squad.Following the executions, Broulard tells Mireau that he will be investigated for ordering artillery to fire on his own men. Mireau denounces this as a betrayal by his commanding officer. After Mireau leaves, Broulard then offers Mireau\u2019s command to Dax, assuming that Dax\u2019s attempts to stop the executions were a ploy to gain Mireau\u2019s job. Discovering that Dax was sincere, Broulard rebukes him for his idealism, but Dax in turn denounces Broulard\u2019s nihilism.After the execution, some of Dax\u2019s soldiers are carousing at an inn. They become more subdued as they listen to and then join in with a captive German girl working as a barmaid and entertainer as she sings a sad German sentimental folk song, The Faithful Hussar. Dax leaves without informing the men that they have been ordered to return to the front and the continuing carnage of the trenches.",

His mid-floor rear window overlooks out onto a courtyard with small garden plots and other apartments in the surrounding blocks. Jeff is regularly visited by his idealistic young socialite and haute couture model girlfriend Lisa Fremont and Stella, a middle-aged cynical, tough as boots medical insurance nurse  New Yorkers from either end of the social spectrum bridged by Jeff in the middle. During an intense heat wave and chafing at his restrictions, Jeff watches his various diverse neighbours of the all and sundry population, who keep their windows open to stay cool, noting their differing habits and lifestyles, including a professional dancer, coined Miss Torso, a songwriter with writers block, and notably a large traveling salesman of wholesale costume jewelry, Lars Thorwald, henpecked by his bedridden wife. One night, Jeff, alone, hears a woman scream followed by the sound of breaking glass. Later that night just before 2 a.m, after dozing in the heat in his wheelchair, Jeff wakes as a thunderstorm breaks. He observes Thorwald making repeated halfhour excursions carrying his aluminium sample case. Later still that night, after Jeff dozes off again, Thorwald is seen leaving his apartment along with a woman obscured by a large floppybrimmed black hat. The next morning, Jeff notices Thorwalds wife is gone, and sees him cleaning a large knife and handsaw. Thorwald also has movingmen haul away a large trunk. After digging out his binoculars and then his camera with a highpower telephoto zoom lens, a suspicious Jeff starts closely observing Thorwalds activities. He becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife, and tells first Stella, who believes him, and then later to an initially doubting Lisa until they notice that Thorwalds wife is no longer in bed and the mattress is rolled up. Jeff calls his friend and war buddy in the US Air Force reconnaissance, Tom Doyle, a detective lieutenant with the New York City Police Department, and requests that he investigate Thorwald. A very skeptical Doyle investigates extensively and finds nothing suspicious, and allays the suspicions of Jeff and Lisa. Later that night, the pet toy dog belonging to the neighbor one floor up from the Thorwalds is found dead in the courtyard. Its alarmed owner yells, drawing the attention of everyone, except Thorwald, who sits silently in his dark apartment lit only by the glow of his lit cigar. Convinced his theory is true, Jeff has Lisa pull out some slides taken two weeks earlier and through a slide viewer he spots that some flowers have grown shorter, against all good reason. The following night, pretending to be a blackmailer, Jeff telephones and lures Thorwald away from his apartment to allow Lisa and Stella to investigate Thorwalds flower bed where the dog was digging. Nothing is found, but Lisa climbs the fire escape and through Thorwalds window and searches further for evidence in the flat. Stella hurries back to Jeff and then below Thorwalds apartment, Jeff and Stella are distracted watching a lower ground floor neighborcoined Miss LonelyHeartscontemplating an overdose and call the police. The songwriter has finally finished his song Mona Lisa and plays it loudly causing Miss LonelyHearts to not go through with her suicide attempt. As they wait, Thorwald unexpectedly returns early and catches Lisa on his property. The police intervene as the pair scuffles. During their questioning, Lisa signals to Jeff that she is wearing Mrs Thorwalds wedding ring. Thorwald sees this and realizes Jeff is surveilling his apartment. Jeff phones Doyle and leaves an urgent message while Stella goes to bail Lisa out of jail. Thorwald locates and attacks Jeff in his darkened apartment, his only defense being his camera flash bulbs. While grappling, Doyle and other officers storm the courtyardfollowed by Lisa and Stellaand arrest Thorwald just as he drops Jeff out the window to fall two storeys to the ground. Thorwald confesses to his wifes murder to the arresting police detectives. Doyle, still formally dressed for a night out with his wife, relays a question from Stella as to what was buried under the flowers. Stella is told it was a hat box, now in the flat, but at being offered a chance to check it out, her ghoulishness swiftly departs and she claims that she wants to have nothing more to do with it. A few days later, the heat wave has broken and life in the apartment complex has returned to normal. Miss LonelyHearts is seen in a semiromantic position with the songwriter in his studio apartment. Jeff has broken his other leg in the fall and so now has both legs up in casts. Lisa is seen stretched out next to him, wearing a much more casual outfit and reading a travel book. After noticing Jeff asleep, she puts down the book on exploration titled Beyond the High Himalayas and turns instead to read the high fashion magazine Harpers Bazaar.",

However, after running out of fuel, their plane crashes into a tree and the soldier subsequently suffers memory loss. Upon being rescued, Schultz is informed that Tomainia has officially surrendered to the Allied Forces, while the Jewish soldier is carried off to a hospital. Twenty years later, still suffering from amnesia, the Jewish soldier returns to his previous profession as a barber in a ghetto. The ghetto is now governed by Schultz who has been promoted in the Tomainian regime, now transformed into a dictatorship under the ruthless Adenoid Hynkel. The barber falls in love with a neighbor, Hannah, and together they try to resist persecution by military forces. The stormtroopers capture the barber and are about to kill him, but Schultz recognizes him and restrains them. By recognizing him, and reminding him of World War I, Schultz helps the barber regain his memory. Meanwhile, Hynkel tries to finance his evergrowing military forces by borrowing money from a Jewish banker called Hermann Epstein, leading to a temporary ease on the restrictions on the ghetto. However, ultimately the banker refuses to lend him the money. Furious, Hynkel orders a purge of the Jews. Schultz protests against this inhumane policy and is sent to a concentration camp. He escapes and hides in the ghetto with the barber. Schultz tries to persuade the Jewish family to assassinate Hynkel in a suicide attack, but they are dissuaded by Hannah. Troops search the ghetto, arrest Schultz and the barber, and send both to a concentration camp. Hannah and her family flee to freedom at a vineyard in the neighboring country of Osterlich. Hynkel has a dispute with the dictator of the nation of Bacteria, Benzino Napaloni, over which country should invade Osterlich. The two dictators argue over a treaty to govern the invasion, while dining together at an elaborate buffet, which happens to provide a jar of English mustard. The quarrel becomes heated and descends into a food fight, which is only resolved when both men eat the hot mustard and are shocked into cooperating. After signing the treaty with Napaloni, Hynkel orders the invasion of Osterlich. Hannah and her family are trapped by the invading force and beaten by a squad of arriving soldiers. Escaping from the camp in stolen uniforms, Schultz and the barber, dressed as Hynkel, arrive at the Osterlich frontier, where a victory parade crowd is waiting to be addressed by Hynkel. The real Hynkel is mistaken for the barber while out duck hunting in civilian clothes and is knocked out and taken to the camp. Schultz tells the barber to go to the platform and impersonate Hynkel, as the only way to save their lives once they reach Osterlichs capital. The barber has no other choice. He announces that he as Hynkel has had a change of heart and makes an impassioned speech for brotherhood and goodwill, encouraging soldiers to fight for liberty, and unite the people in the name of democracy. He then addresses a message of hope to Hannah: Look up, Hannah. The soul of man has been given wings, and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow, into the light of hope, into the future, the glorious future that belongs to you, to me, and to all of us. Hannah hears the barbers voice on the radio. She turns toward the rising sunlight, and says to her fellows: Listen.",

            "plot": "Vinayak Rao tells his son Pandurang about the Goddess of Prosperity, the symbol of endless gold and grain, and the mother of all the Gods. Her first offspring Hastar, full of greed, acquired all her gold, but the other gods destroyed him when he went for the grain. The Goddess saved his life by sheltering him in her womb, on the condition that he would be forgotten. However, the residents of Tumbbad built a temple for Hastars worship, provoking the Gods who cursed the village with incessant rain. In 1918, Vinayaks mother is the mistress of the local lord Sarkar and hopes to get a share of his mysterious treasure. Vinayak and his brother Sadashiv stay home with a monstrous old woman chained in a separate room. When Sadashiv is injured after falling from a tree, their mother takes him away to get help. Vinayak then tries to feed the woman, who escapes and tries to eat him instead. He invokes the name of Hastar, making her fall into a slumber. Sarkar and Sadashiv both die, and Vinayak and his mother leave for Pune. Fifteen years later, Vinayak returns to Tumbbad, desperate to escape a life of poverty. The old woman still lives, with a tree growing out of her body, and offers to tell him the secret of Sarkars treasure if he ends her suffering. She leads him to the goddess\u2019 womb, located inside Sarkars mansion, and teaches him to retrieve the treasure. Inside the womb, Hastar dwells, hungry for eons as he was denied the Goddess\u2019 grain. Vinayak descends into the womb with a rope and draws a circle of flour to protect himself. He then lures Hastar with a flour dough doll, and when he is distracted, Vinayak steals gold coins from Hastars loincloth and quickly flees the womb. Vinayak then burns the woman, and keeps traveling from Pune to Tumbbad to retrieve more coins, selling them to his friend and moneylender Raghav, who wonders about the source of Vinayaks newfound wealth. He follows Vinayak to Tumbbad, who tricks him into entering the goddess womb with a dough doll. Hastar attacks Raghav, and Vinayak burns him to end his suffering. In 1947, Vinayak is consumed by greed and decadence, and faces a deteriorating family life. He trains his son Pandurang in retrieving Hastars coins and takes him to Tumbbad, warning him not to bring a dough doll for the practice. Pandurang brings it anyway, prompting Hastar to attack them, but they both narrowly manage to escape. Vinayak later learns that Sarkars mansion was appropriated by the newly formed government of independent India. Hoping to secure as much gold as possible before they lose the mansion, Pandurang suggests stealing Hastars entire loincloth by luring him with multiple dough dolls. However, the plan fails when Hastar multiplies into many clones inside the womb, trapping them. As a last resort, Vinayak ties the dolls around him and faces the attack of Hastar and his clones, allowing Pandurang to escape. Once outside the womb, Pandurang encounters Vinayak, now cursed, who offers him Hastars loincloth. Pandurang refuses, and after putting him to sleep by invoking Hastars name, burns him and leaves Tumbbad, thus ending the cycle of greed.",

            "plot": "Georgekutty started out as an orphan who had dropped out of school after his 4th year. He is now a businessman running a cable television service in the village of Rajakkad. He is married to Rani and they have two daughters Anju and Anu. His only interest apart from his family is watching films, as he spends most of his time in front of the TV in his small office. Due to his knowledge of his films, he is respected by the locals. During a nature camp, Anju gets photographed in the bathroom by a hidden cell phone held by Varun Prabhakar, who is the son of Inspector General of Police Geetha Prabhakar. Varun meets Anju and blackmails her to have sex with him. That same night, he arrives at their house, but Rani is informed by Anju and pleads Varun to leave Anju alone. He agrees on the condition that Rani have sex with him instead. In a successful attempt to destroy Varuns phone, Anju accidentally strikes Varun in the head, killing him. They bury his body in a compost pit, which is witnessed by Anu. Rani informs Georgekutty about the incident and he devises a way to save his family from the police. He removes the broken phone and disposes of Varuns car, which is seen by the local police constable Sahadevan, who hold a grudge against Georgekutty. As Georgekutty takes his family on a trip to attend a religious retreat, a movie and a restaurant, Geetha starts an investigation upon learning that Varun has gone missing. After a preliminary investigation, Geetha calls Georgekutty and his family for questioning. Georgekutty had predicted that this would happen and taught his family how to change their alibi at the time of murder. When questioned individually, they reply the same thing and they had also shown the bill of the restaurant, the movies and bus journey tickets as a proof of their alibi. Geetha questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Georgekuttys alibi. However, Geetha realises that on the day of the incident, Georgekutty had taken the tickets and the bill, made acquaintance with the owners and had gone for the trip with his family the next day, thus proving his alibi and making the owners unwittingly tell the lie. Georgekutty and his family are arrested and Sahadevan brutally tortures them, including Anu to make the truth come out. Geetha learns from Varuns friend Alex about Anjus video created by Varun. Eventually, Anu gives in and reveals the place where the body is buried. After digging the compost pit, they find the carcass of a cow, indicating that Georgekutty had moved the body. Before Geetha and Sahadevan could react to it, Georgekutty and Anu goes to the media and complains of Sahedevans torture against his family. Enraged, Sahadevan tries to attack the family again, but Ranis brother Rajesh and the villagers saves them and subdues Sahadevan, who later ends up being suspended while Geetha resigns from her post. Geetha and her husband Prabhakar meet Georgekutty to ask forgiveness for their rude and violent behavior and of their sons perverted behaviour, but Georgekutty suspects there might be foul play involved and still does not reveal directly about Varuns death. Georgekutty, now in remand, signs a register at the newly constructed local police station and leaves. As the police inspector tells him that he will find the body and that the police are not fools, Georgekutty replies by telling the officer he believes that the police are there to help the people. As he exits the police station, it is revealed that Georgekutty had buried Varuns body beneath the police station.",

            "plot": "Following the death of their mother Nawal, an Arab immigrant in Canada, Jeanne and her twin brother Simon meet with French Canadian notary Jean Lebel, their mothers employer and family friend. Nawals will refers to not keeping a promise, denying her a proper gravestone and casket, unless Jeanne and Simon track down their mysterious brother, whose existence they were previously unaware of, and their father, who they believed was dead. Nawal has left two letters; one is to be delivered to Jeanne and Simons father, and the other is to be delivered to their brother. Jeanne accepts; Simon, on the other hand, seemingly having had a more difficult relationship with Nawal and her unusual personality, is reluctant to join Jeanne on this pursuit. A series of flashbacks reveal Nawal came from a Christian Arab family in an unnamed Levantine country, and that she fell in love with a refugee named Wahab, resulting in her pregnancy. Her family murders her lover and nearly shoots her in an honor killing, but her grandmother spares her, making her promise to leave the village after the birth of her baby and start a new life in the fictional city of Daresh. The grandmother tattoos the back of the babys heel and sends him to an orphanage. While Nawal is at university in Daresh, civil war and war crimes break out, with Nawal opposing the war on human rights grounds. Her sons orphanage in Kfar Khout is destroyed by a Muslim militant, Chamseddine, who converts him into an Islamic child soldier. Nawal leaves town to try to find her son and boards a bus full of Muslim refugees. Christian Nationalists shoot the driver and fire into the bus full of passengers, only missing Nawal and a mother with her child. As the Nationalists prepare to set the bus on fire, the survivors try to escape towards the back of the bus. Nawal shows her crucifix and tells the Nationalists that she is Christian. She attempts to save a child by claiming her as her own, but the child runs back towards the burning bus, calling for her mother, and is unceremoniously shot. Nawal finds her way back to town and joins the Muslim fighters. She tutors the son of a nationalist leader, eventually earning enough trust to smuggle in a gun to shoot the leader. She is imprisoned in Kfar Ryat and sings through the screams of other prisoners, earning her the nickname The Woman Who Sings. To attempt to break her, she is raped by torturer Abou Tarek who leaves her saying, Sing now. She consequently gives birth to the twins. After traveling to her mothers native country, Jeanne gradually uncovers this past and persuades Simon to join her. With help from Lebel, they learn their brothers name is Nihad of May the month he was born in and track down Chamseddine. Simon meets with him, and he reveals the war-mad Nihad was captured by the nationalists, turned by them, trained as a torturer, and then sent to Kfar Ryat, where he took the name Abou Tarek, making him both the twins half-brother and father; as such, both letters are addressed to the same person. Like Nawal, Nihads superiors gave him a new life in Canada after the war. By chance, Nawal encountered him at a Canadian swimming pool and saw both the tattoo proving him as her son and his face proving him as her rapist. The shock of learning the truth caused Nawal to suffer a stroke, which led to her decline and untimely death at age 60. The twins find Nihad in Canada and deliver Nawals letters to him. He opens both of them; the first letter addresses him as the twins father, the rapist, and is filled with contempt. The second letter addresses him as the twins brother and is instead written with caring words, saying that he, as Nawals son, is deserving of love. Horrified at the truth, Nihad tries to chase after the twins, but they are gone. Nawal gets her gravestone. Sometime later, Nihad visits it.",

Heartbroken, he decides to undergo the same procedure. In preparation, he records a tape recounting his memories of their volatile relationship. The Lacuna employees work on Joels brain as he sleeps in his apartment so that he will wake up with no memory of the procedure. One employee, Patrick, leaves to see Clementine. Since her procedure, he has been using Joel\\'s and Clementine\\'s memories as a guide for seducing her. While the procedure runs on Joels brain, the technician, Stan, and the secretary, Mary, take drugs, party and have sex. Joel re-experiences his memories of Clementine as they are erased, starting with their last fight. As he reaches earlier, happier memories, he realizes that he does not want to forget her. His mental projection of Clementine suggests that Joel hides her in memories that do not involve her. This halts the procedure, but Stan calls his boss, Howard, who arrives and restarts it. Joel comes to his last remaining memory of Clementine: the day they first met, on a beach in Montauk. As the memory crumbles around them, Clementine tells Joel to meet her in Montauk. In Joels apartment, while Stan is outside, Mary tells Howard she is in love with him and they kiss. Howards wife arrives and sees them through the window. Furious, she tells Howard to tell Mary the truth: that Mary and Howard previously had an affair, and that Mary had her memories erased. Disgusted, Mary steals the Lacuna records and mails them to the patients, including Joel and Clementine. Joel wakes up, his memories of Clementine erased. He impulsively goes to Montauk and accidentally meets Clementine on the train ride home. They are drawn to one another, and go on a date to the frozen Charles River in Boston. Joel drives Clementine home and Patrick sees the two of them, realizing they have found each other again. Joel and Clementine receive their Lacuna records and listen to their tapes. They are shocked by the bitter memories they had of each other and almost separate again, but agree to try again.",

            "plot": "Am\u00e9lie Poulain is born in 1974 and brought up by eccentric parents who \u2013 incorrectly believing that she has a heart defect \u2013 decide to homeschool her. To cope with her loneliness, Am\u00e9lie develops an active imagination and a mischievous personality. When Am\u00e9lie is six, her mother, Amandine, is killed when a suicidal Canadian tourist jumps from the roof of Notre-Dame de Paris and lands on her. As a result, her father, Rapha\u00ebl, withdraws more and more from society. Am\u00e9lie leaves home at the age of 18 and becomes a waitress at the Caf\u00e9 des 2 Moulins in Montmartre, which is staffed and frequented by a collection of eccentrics. She is single and lets her imagination roam freely, finding contentment in simple pleasures like dipping her hand into grain sacks, cracking cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with a spoon, and skipping stones along the Canal Saint-Martin. On 31 August 1997, startled by the news of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, Am\u00e9lie drops a plastic perfume-stopper, which dislodges a wall tile and accidentally reveals an old metal box which contains childhood memorabilia hidden by a boy who lived in her apartment decades earlier. Am\u00e9lie resolves to track down the boy and return the box to him. She promises herself that if it makes him happy, she will devote her life to bringing happiness to others. After asking the apartments concierge and several old tenants about the boys identity, Am\u00e9lie meets her reclusive neighbour, Raymond Dufayel, an artist with brittle bone disease who replicates Pierre-Auguste Renoirs 1881 painting Luncheon of the Boating Party every year. He recalls the boys name as Bretodeau. Am\u00e9lie finds the man, Dominique Bretodeau, and surreptitiously gives him the box. Moved to tears by the discovery and the memories it holds, Bretodeau resolves to reconcile with his estranged daughter and the grandson he has never met. Am\u00e9lie happily embarks on her new mission. Am\u00e9lie secretly executes complex schemes that positively affect the lives of those around her. She escorts a blind man to the M\u00e9tro station while giving him a rich description of the street scenes he passes. She persuades her father to follow his dream of touring the world by stealing his garden gnome and having a flight attendant friend mail pictures of it posing with landmarks from all over the world. She starts a romance between her hypochondriacal co-worker Georgette and Joseph, a patron of the caf\u00e9. She convinces Madeleine Wallace, the concierge of her block of flats, that the husband who abandoned her had sent her a final conciliatory love letter just before his accidental death years before. She plays practical jokes on Collignon, the nasty greengrocer. Mentally exhausted, Collignon no longer abuses his meek, good-natured assistant Lucien. A delighted Lucien subsequently takes charge at the grocery stand. Dufayel, having observed Am\u00e9lie, begins a conversation with her about his painting. Although he has copied the same Renoir painting 20 times, he has never quite captured the look of the girl drinking a glass of water. They discuss the meaning of this character, and over several conversations, Am\u00e9lie begins projecting her loneliness onto the image. Dufayel recognizes this and uses the girl in the painting to push Am\u00e9lie to examine her attraction to a quirky young man, Nino Quincampoix, who collects the discarded photographs of strangers from passport photo booths. When Am\u00e9lie bumps into Nino a second time, she realizes she is falling in love with him. He accidentally drops a photo album in the street. Am\u00e9lie retrieves it. Am\u00e9lie plays a cat-and-mouse game with Nino around Paris before returning his treasured album anonymously. After arranging a meeting at the 2 Moulins, Am\u00e9lie panics and tries to deny her identity. Her co-worker, Gina, concerned for Am\u00e9is well-being, screens Nino for her; Josephs comment about this misleads Am\u00e9lie to believe she has lost Nino to Gina. It takes Dufayels insight to give her the courage to pursue Nino, resulting in a romantic night together and the beginning of a relationship. The film ends as Am\u00e9lie experiences a moment of happiness she has found for herself.",

The two deal heroin in a bid to realize their dreams; Harry and his girlfriend Marion plan to open a clothing store for Marions designs, while Tyrone seeks the approval of his mother and an escape from the ghetto. When Sara receives a call that she has been invited to appear on her favorite game show, she begins a restrictive crash diet, hoping to fit into a red dress that she wore at Harrys graduation.At the advice of her friend Rae, Sara visits a physician who prescribes her amphetamines to control her appetite. She begins losing weight rapidly and is excited by how much energy she has. When Harry recognizes the signs of her drug abuse and implores her to stop taking the amphetamines, Sara insists that the chance to appear on television and the increased admiration from her friends Ada and Rae are her remaining reasons to live. As time passes, Sara becomes frantic waiting for the invitation and increases her dosage, which causes her to develop amphetamine psychosis.Tyrone is caught in a shootout between drug traffickers and the Sicilian Mafia and is arrested despite his innocence. Harry has to use most of their saved money to post bail. As a result of the gang warfare, the local supply of heroin becomes restricted, and they are unable to find any to buy. Eventually, Tyrone hears of a large shipment coming to New York from Florida, but the price has doubled and the minimum purchase risk is high. Harry encourages Marion to engage in prostitution, particularly with her psychiatrist, Arnold, as a client. This request, along with their mounting withdrawal symptoms, strains their relationship.Saras increased dosage of amphetamines distorts her sense of reality, and she begins to hallucinate that she is mocked by the host and crowd from the television show, and attacked by her refrigerator. Sara flees her apartment and goes to the casting agency office in Manhattan to confirm when she will be on television. Saras disturbed state causes her to be admitted to a psychiatric ward, where she fails to respond to various medications, and undergoes electroconvulsive therapy. After the heroin shipment descends into a melee, Harry and Tyrone travel to Miami to buy heroin directly from the wholesaler. However, Harrys arm has become gangrenous from heroin use, so the two stop at a hospital. The doctor realizes that Harry is a drug addict and calls the police, resulting in Harry and Tyrone being arrested.Back in New York City, a desperate Marion begins to work for a pimp, Big Tim, and participates in group sex for drugs. Saras treatment leaves her in a catatonic state of dissociation, to the horror of her friends Ada and Rae, who weep and try to comfort each other on a bench outside the hospital. Harrys arm is amputated above the elbow, and he breaks down in tears as he realizes Marion will not visit him despite a gentle nurse trying to reassure him that she will come. Tyrone is subjected to grueling labor and psychological abuse from the racist prison guards, all while experiencing a painful heroin withdrawal. Marion returns home and lies on her sofa, clutching her scoreand is surrounded by her crumpled and discarded clothing designs. Each of the four characters curls into a fetal position. Sara imagines herself as the game show winner, with Harry engaged and successful arriving as a guest. Sara and Harry lovingly embrace.",

            "plot": "Twenty-year-old Will Hunting of South Boston is a self-taught math genius who was recently paroled after completing a prison term. He works as a janitor at MIT, and spends his free time drinking with his friends Chuckie, Billy and Morgan. When Professor Gerald Lambeau posts a difficult combinatorial mathematics problem on a blackboard as a challenge for his graduate students, Will solves the problem anonymously, stunning both the students and Lambeau. As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem. He later catches Will writing the solution on the blackboard late at night, but initially thinks Will is vandalizing it and chases him off. At a bar, Will meets Skylar, an English woman about to graduate from Harvard College, who plans on attending medical school at Stanford. Meanwhile, Lambeau, realizing Will was not vandalizing the problem but solving it, asks the campus maintenance staff his whereabouts, but is informed he did not turn up for work. Lambeau learns Will was placed at MIT by a parole program, and obtains his parole officers details. Will and his friends have started a fight with a gang that includes a member who used to bully Will as a child. Will is arrested after he attacks a responding police officer. Lambeau sits in on his court appearance and watches Will defend himself. He arranges for Will to avoid jail time if he agrees to study mathematics under Lambeaus supervision and participate in psychotherapy sessions. Will agrees but treats his therapists with mockery. In desperation, Lambeau calls on Dr. Sean Maguire, his college roommate, who now teaches psychology at Bunker Hill Community College. Unlike the other therapists, Sean actually challenges Wills defense mechanisms. During the first session, Will insults his deceased wife, and Sean threatens him, but after a few unproductive sessions, Will finally begins to open up. Will is particularly struck by Seans story of how he met his wife, who later died of cancer, by giving up his ticket to the historic game six of the 1975 World Series after falling in love at first sight. Seans explanation for surrendering his ticket was to see about a girl, and he does not regret his decision. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his home. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wifes death. Lambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but he scorns them by sending Chuckie as his chief negotiator, and by turning down a position at the NSA with a scathing critique of the agencys moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him. Will breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out to Will that he is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions he interviews for, telling him he owes it to his friends to make the most of opportunities they will never have, even if it means leaving one day. He then tells Will that the best part of his day is the brief moment when he waits at his doorstep, thinking Will has moved on to something greater. Will walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over Wills potential. Lambeau leaves, and Sean and Will talk and it comes to light that they were both victims of child abuse. Sean helps him see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that it is not his fault by repeatedly stating, It\\'s not your fault, causing him to break down in tears in Seans arms. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will manage his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau, deciding to take a sabbatical. Wills friends give him a used car for his 21st birthday so he can commute to work. Later, Chuckie goes to Wills to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness, as Will had finally done what Chuckie had been wishing for all these years. Will leaves a note for Sean asking him to tell Lambeau that he had to go see about a girl, revealing he passed on the job offer and instead is heading to California to reunite with Skylar.",

White flees with Orange, who was shot during the escape and is bleeding profusely in the back seat of a car driven by White. At their hideout, White and Orange rendezvous with Pink, who believes that the job was a setup and that the police were waiting for them. White informs him that Brown is dead, Blue and Blonde are missing, and Blonde murdered several civilians during the heist. White is furious that Joe, his old friend, would employ Blonde, whom he describes as a psychopath. Pink has hidden the diamonds nearby and argues with White over whether to get medical attention for Orange, and the pair draw guns on each other. They stand down when Blonde arrives with a kidnapped policeman, Marvin Nash. Sometime earlier, Blonde meets with the Cabots, having been paroled after a fouryear prison sentence. To reward him for not giving Joes name to the authorities, they offer him a no-show job. Blonde is grateful but insists that he wants to get back to real work, and they recruit him for the heist. In the present, White and Pink beat Nash for information. Eddie arrives and orders them to go with him to ditch the getaway vehicles, leaving Blonde in charge of Nash and Orange. Nash denies knowledge, but Blonde ignores him and resumes the torture, cutting off Nashs ear with a straight razor. He prepares to set him on fire, but Orange shoots Blonde dead. Orange reveals to Nash that he is an undercover police officer, and that the police will arrive when Joe comes to the warehouse. When Eddie, Pink, and White return, Orange tries to convince them that Blonde planned to kill them all and steal the diamonds for himself. Eddie shoots and kills Nash and accuses Orange of lying, since Blonde was loyal to his father. Joe arrives with news that the police have killed Blue. He is about to execute Orange, who he suspects is the traitor behind the setup, but White intervenes and holds Joe at gunpoint, insisting that Orange is not a police officer. Eddie aims his gun at White, creating a Mexican standoff. All three fire. Both Cabots are killed, and White and Orange are hit. Pink takes the diamonds and flees, but a crash is heard outside and gunshots follow. As White cradles the dying Orange in his arms, Orange confesses that he is a police officer. White presses his gun to Oranges head. The police storm the warehouse and order White to drop his gun. White is killed by the police after he shoots Orange.",

Drill instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman uses harsh methods to train them for combat. Among the recruits are the wisecracking J. T. Davis, who receives the name Joker after interrupting Hartman\\'s introductory speech with an impression of John Wayne, and the overweight and dim-witted Leonard Lawrence, whom Hartman nicknames Gomer Pyle.During boot camp, Hartman names Joker as squad leader and puts him in charge of helping Pyle improve. One evening while doing a hygiene inspection, Hartman notices that Pyle\\'s footlocker is unlocked. As he inspects it for signs of theft, he notices a jelly doughnut inside, blames the platoon for Pyle\\'s infractions and adopts a collective punishment policy by which any infraction committed by Pyle will earn a punishment for everyone else in the platoon. The next night, the recruits haze Pyle with a blanket party in which Joker reluctantly participates. Following this, Pyle appears to reinvent himself as a model recruit, showing particular expertise in marksmanship. This pleases Hartman but worries Joker, who believes Pyle may be suffering a mental breakdown after seeing Pyle talking to his rifle. The recruits graduate, but the night before they leave Parris Island, Joker, who is on fire watch duty, discovers Pyle in the barracks latrine loading his service rifle with live ammunition, executing drill commands, and loudly reciting the Rifleman\\'s Creed. Hartman is awakened by the commotion and attempts to intervene by ordering Pyle to give the rifle to him, but Pyle fatally shoots Hartman and then commits suicide, to a witnessing Joker.Following Hartman\\'s death, Joker becomes a sergeant in January 1968 and is based in Da Nang for the newspaper Stars and Stripes alongside his colleague Private First Class Rafterman, a combat photographer. The Tet Offensive begins and the base is attacked, but holds. The following morning, Joker and Rafterman are sent to Phu Bai, where Joker searches for and reunites with Sergeant Cowboy, a friend he met at Parris Island. During the Battle of Hu\u1ebf, platoon leader Lieutenant Walter J. Touchdown Schinoski and a fellow Marine are killed by the NVA, who are eliminated soon after. Later, a booby trap kills the squad leader, Sergeant Crazy Earl, leaving Cowboy in command. Becoming lost in the city, the squad is ambushed by a Viet Cong sniper who kills two members, Eightball and Doc Jay. As the squad approaches the sniper\\'s location, Cowboy is killed.Assuming command, squad machine gunner Animal Mother leads an attack on the sniper. Joker locates her first, but his M16 rifle jams, alerting the sniper to his presence. As the sniper opens fire, she is revealed to be a teenage girl. Rafterman shoots and mortally wounds her. As the squad converges on the sniper, she begs for death, leading to an argument over whether to kill her or leave her to die in pain. Animal Mother agrees to a mercy killing but only if Joker will handle it, and after some hesitation, Joker shoots her. Later, as night falls, the Marines march to the Perfume River singing the Mickey Mouse March. A narration of Joker\\'s thoughts conveys that, despite being in a world of shit, he is glad to be alive and no longer afraid.",

            "plot": "Lieutenant Werner, a war correspondent on the U96 in October 1941, is driven by her captain and chief engineer to a French bordello, where he meets some of the crew. Thomsen, another captain, gives a drunken speech to celebrate his Ritterkreuz award and mocks Adolf Hitler.The next morning, U96 sails out of the harbour of La Rochelle, and Werner is given a tour of the boat. He observes ideological differences between the new crew members and the hardened veterans, particularly the captain, who is cynical about the war. The new men, including Werner, are mocked by the rest, who share a tight bond. One Nazi officer, 1WO the first watch officer, is disliked due to his pro-Nazi beliefs and meticulous grooming habits, which tie up the only bathroom. After days of boredom, the crew is excited by another Uboats spotting of an enemy convoy, but they are soon spotted by a British destroyer and attacked with depth charges. They escape with light damage.The next three weeks are spent enduring relentless North Atlantic gales. Morale drops after various misfortunes, but the crew is cheered by a chance encounter with Thomsens boat. After the storm ends, the boat encounters a British convoy and launches three torpedoes, sinking two ships. They are spotted by a destroyer and have to dive below test depth, the submarines rated limit. During the ensuing depthcharge attack, the chief machinist, Johann, panics and has to be restrained. The boat sustains heavy damage but manages to surface when night falls. A British tanker they torpedoed is still afloat and on fire, so they torpedo it again, only to learn that sailors are still aboard. The crew watches as the sailors leap overboard and swim towards them. Neither able nor willing to accommodate prisoners, the captain orders the boat to back away.The exhausted crew looks forward to returning home to La Rochelle for Christmas, but the boat is ordered to La Spezia, Italy, which means passing through the Strait of Gibraltaran area defended by the Royal Navy. The Uboat makes a secret night rendezvous at the harbour of Vigo, in neutral but Axisfriendly Spain, with the SS Weser, an interned German merchant ship that clandestinely provides Uboats with fuel, torpedoes, and other supplies. The filthy submariners appear at the opulent dinner prepared for them and are warmly greeted by the Wesers officers. The captain learns from an envoy of the German consulate that his request for Werner and the chief engineer to be sent back to Germany has been denied.The crew finishes resupplying and depart for Italy. As they approach the Strait of Gibraltar and are about to dive, they are attacked and badly damaged by a British fighter plane, wounding the navigator, Kriechbaum. The captain orders the boat south towards the North African coast at full speed, determined to save his crew even if he loses the boat. British warships begin shelling, and they are forced to dive. When attempting to level off, the boat does not respond and continues to sink until, just prior to exceeding its crush depth, it lands on a sea shelf at a depth of 280 metres. The crew works to make repairs before running out of oxygen. After over 16 hours, they manage to surface by blowing their ballast tanks, and limp back towards La Rochelle under cover of darkness.The crew reach La Rochelle on Christmas Eve. After Kriechbaum is taken ashore to an ambulance, Royal Air Force planes bomb and strafe the facilities. Ullmann, Johann, the second watch officer, and the Bibelforscher are killed; Frenssen, Bootsmann Lamprecht, and Hinrich are wounded. After the raid, Werner leaves the submarine penUboat bunker in which he had taken shelter, and finds the captain badly injured by shrapnel, watching his Uboat sink. After the boat disappears, the captain collapses and dies. Werner rushes to his body and surveys the scene with tears in his eyes.",

            "plot": "In 1936, amid the Great Depression, grifter Johnny Hooker and his partners Luther Coleman and Joe Erie con $11,000 in cash from an unsuspecting victim in Joliet, Illinois. Hooker loses his share of the con on a rigged roulette game, while Luther, buoyed by the windfall, decides to retire.  He tells Hooker to seek out his old friend Henry Gondorff in Chicago to learn the big con. Corrupt Joliet police lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing that their mark was a courier for vicious IrishAmerican crime boss Doyle Lonnegan. Lonnegans men murder Luther and the courier. After finding Luther dead, Hooker flees to Chicago. Hooker finds Gondorff drunk and in hiding from the FBI, running a carousel that is a front for a brothel, and asks for help taking down Lonnegan. Initially reluctant, Gondorff relents and recruits a team of experienced con men. They decide to resurrect an elaborate, obsolete scam known as the wire, using a large crew to create a phony off-track betting parlor. Snyder and Lonnegans men track Hooker to Chicago; Gondorff warns Hooker that if either of them find him, the con will have to fold. Aboard the opulent 20th Century Limited, Gondorff, posing as the boorish Chicago bookie Shaw, buys into Lonnegans private, highstakes poker game, being facilitated by the trains conductor. Shaw infuriates Lonnegan with his obnoxious behavior, then cheats him out of $15,000. Hooker, posing as Shaws disgruntled employee Kelly, is sent to collect the winnings and to convince Lonnegan to help him take over Shaws operation. Hooker returns home to find Lonnegans men waiting to assassinate him, but avoids their efforts; Gondorff is spooked by their attempt, but Hooker convinces him to keep the con alive. Snyders pursuit of Hooker attracts the attention of undercover FBI agents led by Agent Polk, who orders Snyder to bring Hooker in to entrap Gondorff. Meanwhile, Lonnegan, frustrated with his mens inability to kill Hooker for the Joliet con, orders the job to be given to Salino, his best assassin. A mysterious figure with black leather gloves begins following and observing Hooker. Kelly gives Lonnegan a tip on a 7to1 long shot in a horse race that pays off. When Lonnegan presses him for details, he reveals that he has a partner, Les Harmon (actually con man Kid Twist), in the Chicago Western Union office, who will help them topple Shaw by winning bets he books on horse races through pastposting. Lonnegan is convinced after being provided the trifecta of another race, and agrees to finance a $500,000 bet to break Shaw and get revenge. Shortly thereafter, Snyder captures Hooker and brings him before Polk, who forces Hooker to betray Gondorff by threatening to jail Luther Colemans widow. Feeling despondent the night before the sting, Hooker sleeps with a diner waitress named Loretta. The next morning, as she walks toward him in an alley, the blackgloved man appears and shoots her dead before she could shoot Hooker. The man reveals to Hooker that he was hired by Gondorff to protect him and that the waitress was in fact Salino. At Harmons direction, Lonnegan bets $500,000 at Shaws parlor on a horse named Lucky Dan. As the race begins, Harmon arrives and expresses shock at Lonnegans bet: when he said place it he meant that the horse would place (ie, finish second). In a panic, Lonnegan rushes to the teller window and demands his money back, at which point Polk, Snyder, and a halfdozen FBI agents storm the parlor. Polk tells Hooker he is free to go.  Shocked at the betrayal, Gondorff shoots Hooker. Polk shoots Gondorff and orders Snyder to get the ostensibly respectable Lonnegan away from the crime scene. With Lonnegan and Snyder safely away, Hooker and Gondorff rise amid cheers and laughter: Polk is actually Hickey, a fellow con man, who has been running a con atop the con with his FBI agents to divert Snyder and ensure that Lonnegan abandons the money without ever realizing he was taken. As the con men strip the room of its contents, Hooker refuses his share of the money, claiming he would lose it anyway, and walks away with Gondorff.",

            "plot": "In a prehistoric veld, a tribe of hominins is driven away from a water hole by a rival tribe, and the next day finds an alien monolith. The tribe learns how to use a bone as a weapon and, after a first hunt, use it to drive the rival tribe away.Millions of years later, Dr Heywood Floyd, Chairman of the United States National Council of Astronautics, travels to Clavius Base, an American lunar outpost. During a stopover at Space Station Five, he meets Russian scientists who are concerned that Clavius seems to be unresponsive. He refuses to discuss rumours of an epidemic at the base. At Clavius, Floyd addresses a meeting of personnel to whom he stresses the need for secrecy regarding their newest discovery. His mission is to investigate a recently found artefact, a monolith buried four million years earlier near the lunar crater Tycho. As he and others examine the object and are taking photographs, it emits a high-powered radio signal.Eighteen months later, the American spacecraft Discovery One is bound for Jupiter, with mission pilots and scientists Dr Dave Bowman and Dr Frank Poole on board, along with three other scientists in suspended animation. Most of Discoverys operations are controlled by HAL, a HAL 9000 computer with a human-like personality. When HAL reports the imminent failure of an antenna control device, Bowman retrieves it in an extravehicular activity (EVA) pod, but finds nothing wrong. HAL suggests reinstalling the device and letting it fail so the problem can be verified. Mission Control advises the astronauts that results from their backup 9000 computer indicate that HAL has made an error, but HAL blames it on human error. Concerned about HALs behaviour, Bowman and Poole enter an EVA pod so they can talk in private without HAL overhearing. They agree to disconnect HAL if he is proven wrong. HAL follows their conversation by lip reading.While Poole is floating away from his pod to replace the antenna unit, HAL takes control of the pod and attacks him, sending Poole tumbling away from the ship with a severed air line. Bowman takes another pod to rescue Poole. While he is outside, HAL turns off the life support functions of the crewmen in suspended animation, killing them. When Bowman returns to the ship with Pooles body, HAL refuses to let him back in, stating that their plan to deactivate him jeopardises the mission. Bowman releases Pooles body and opens the ships emergency airlock with his remote manipulators. Lacking a helmet for his spacesuit, he positions his pod carefully so that when he jettisons the pods door, he is propelled by the escaping air across the vacuum into Discoverys airlock. He enters HALs processor core and begins disconnecting most of HALs circuits, ignoring HALs pleas to stop. When he is finished, a prerecorded video by Heywood Floyd plays, revealing that the missions actual objective is to investigate the radio signal sent from the monolith to Jupiter.At Jupiter, Bowman finds a third, much larger monolith orbiting the planet. He leaves Discovery in an EVA pod to investigate. He is pulled into a vortex of coloured light and observes bizarre astronomical phenomena and strange landscapes of unusual colours as he passes by. Finally he finds himself in a large neoclassical bedroom where he sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself: first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in bed. A monolith appears at the foot of the bed, and as Bowman reaches for it, he is transformed into a foetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light floating in space above the Earth.",

            "plot": "C.C. Bud Baxter is a lonely office worker at an insurance company in New York City. To climb the corporate ladder, he allows four company managers to take turns borrowing his apartment for their extramarital affairs. Baxter meticulously juggles the booking schedule, but the steady stream of women convinces his neighbors that he is a playboy. Baxter solicits glowing performance reviews from the four managers and submits them to personnel director Jeff Sheldrake, who then promises to promote him provided that Sheldrake also earns use of the apartment for his own affairs starting that night. As compensation for this short notice, he gives Baxter two tickets to see The Music Man. Bud asks Fran Kubelik, an elevator operator in the office building to whom he is attracted, to join him. She agrees, but first has dinner with a former fling, who turns out to be Sheldrake. When Sheldrake tells her that he plans to divorce his wife to be with her, they head to Baxters apartment, while Baxter waits outside the theater. During the companys raucous Christmas Eve party, Sheldrakes secretary, Miss Olsen, tells Fran that her boss has had numerous affairs with other female employees, including herself. Fran confronts Sheldrake at Baxters apartment; he claims he loves her, but heads back to his family in White Plains. Realizing that Fran is the woman Sheldrake has been taking to his apartment, Baxter lets himself be picked up by a married woman at a local bar. When they arrive at his apartment, he discovers Fran passed out on his bed from an overdose of sleeping pills. He ditches the woman from the bar and enlists his neighbor Dr. Dreyfuss to revive Fran. Baxter implies that he was responsible for the incident; Dreyfuss scolds him for philandering and advises him to be a mensch. Fran spends two days recuperating in Baxters apartment, during which a bond develops between them, especially after he confesses to an earlier suicide attempt over unrequited love. Fran says that she has always suffered bad luck in her love life. As Baxter prepares a romantic dinner, one of the managers arrives for a tryst. Baxter persuades him and his companion to leave, but the manager recognizes Fran and informs his colleagues. Later, the managers take Frans brotherinlaw Karl to the apartment to take her home. Baxter deflects Karls anger over Frans wayward behavior by once again assuming all responsibility. Karl punches him, and Fran kisses Baxter for protecting her. When Sheldrake learns that Miss Olsen told Fran about his affairs, he fires her; she retaliates by spilling all to Sheldrakes wife, who promptly throws him out. Sheldrake welcomes this as an excuse to pursue Fran, although she hints that she is losing interest. Having promoted Baxter to an even higher position, Sheldrake expects Baxter to loan out his apartment yet again for him and Fran. Baxter gives him back the key to the buildings executive washroom instead, proclaiming that he has decided to become a mensch, and quits the firm. He decides to move out of the apartment and begins to pack his belongings. That night at a New Years Eve party, Sheldrake indignantly tells Fran about Baxter quitting. She abandons Sheldrake and runs to the apartment. At the door, she hears an apparent gunshot, but Baxter then opens the door holding a bottle of champagne. The two declare their love for each other and resume a game of gin rummy that they had left unfinished earlier.",

            "plot": "A waiter pages George Kaplan at the Oak Room restaurant at the Plaza Hotel in New York City at the request of two well-dressed thugs. As advertising executive Roger Thornhill summons the same waiter, he is mistaken for Kaplan, kidnapped by the thugs, and brought to the estate of Lester Townsend in Glen Cove. Phillip Vandamm, a foreign spy posing as Townsend, interrogates Thornhill and subsequently arranges to kill him in a staged drunk driving crash; Thornhill survives, but fails to convince the police or his mother of what happened. Returning to the estate, Thornhill learns that Townsend is a United Nations diplomat. Thornhill and his mother visit Kaplan\\'s empty room at the Plaza, where the thugs have followed him. Thornhill heads to the U.N. General Assembly Building to meet Townsend, who he sees is not Vandamm. As he asks Townsend about Vandamm, one of the pursuing thugs throws a knife into Townsend\\'s back. Townsend collapses in Thornhill\\'s arms, and Thornhill is photographed as he grabs the knife, giving the appearance that he is the murderer. Thornhill flees, attempting to find the real Kaplan. The United States Intelligence Agency realizes that Thornhill has been mistaken for Kaplan, but their chief, the Professor, decides against rescuing him for fear of compromising their operation; Kaplan is a non-existent agent they created as a decoy to distract Vandamm. Thornhill sneaks aboard the 20th Century Limited train to Chicago without a ticket, where he meets Eve Kendall, who hides him from the police. The two establish a relationship\u2014on Kendall\\'s part because she is secretly working with Vandamm\u2014and she tells Thornhill that she has arranged a meeting with Kaplan at a rural bus stop in Indiana. When Thornhill arrives at the bus stop, he is attacked by a crop duster armed with a machine gun. After taking cover in a cornfield, he attempts to halt a passing tank truck; the airplane crashes into it and explodes, and he steals a bystander\\'s pickup truck in the ensuing confusion. Thornhill reaches Kaplan\\'s hotel in Chicago and learns that Kaplan had checked out before the time when Kendall claimed to have met with him. He goes to her room and confronts her, but she leaves. Thornhill tracks Kendall to an art auction, where Vandamm is purchasing a Mexican Pur\u00e9pecha statue. Vandamm leaves his henchmen to deal with Thornhill. To escape, Thornhill disrupts the auction until police are called to remove him. He says he is the fugitive murderer, but the Professor intervenes and tells him that Kaplan was fictitious and their real agent is Eve Kendall. Vandamm lives near Mount Rushmore, and the agency thinks he will be leaving the country by plane from there. Thornhill agrees to help maintain Kendall\\'s cover. At the Mount Rushmore visitor center, now willingly playing the role of Kaplan, he negotiates Vandamm\\'s turnover of Kendall to be arrested. Kendall shoots Thornhill with blanks and flees. Afterward, the Professor arranges for Thornhill and Kendall to meet; Thornhill learns that Kendall must depart on the plane with Vandamm and his right-hand man Leonard. He tries to dissuade her from going, but is knocked unconscious at the Professor\\'s behest and locked in a hospital room. Thornhill escapes and goes to Vandamm\\'s house to rescue Kendall, where he overhears that the sculpture holds microfilm and that Leonard has discovered the blanks in Kendall\\'s gun. Vandamm indicates that he will kill Kendall by throwing her from the plane; Thornhill manages to warn her with a surreptitious note. Vandamm, Leonard, and Kendall head for the plane. Thornhill is momentarily held at gunpoint by the housekeeper until he realizes hers is the gun loaded with blanks. As Vandamm boards, Kendall takes the sculpture, runs to the pursuing Thornhill, and they flee to the top of Mount Rushmore. As they climb down, they are pursued by Vandamm\\'s men. A park ranger fatally shoots Leonard, and Vandamm is taken into custody by the Professor. As Kendall hangs on by her fingertips, Thornhill reaches down to pull her up, at which point the scene cuts to him pulling her\u2014now Mrs. Thornhill\u2014into an upper berth on a train, which enters a tunnel.",

On the red carpet, Don tells the story of his rise to stardom, claiming to have grown up cultured and highly educated. His words are contradicted by flashbacks showing his humble roots as a hoofer, vaudeville musician and stuntman alongside his childhood best friend and longtime collaborator Cosmo Brown accompanied by the song Fit as a Fiddle. Don also expresses his admiration for Lina, feeding rumors of a secret romance between them. In reality, the rumors are a publicity stunt and Don barely tolerates Lina, although she believes that he loves her. After the premiere, Don is mobbed by fans and escapes by jumping into a passing car driven by Kathy Selden. Kathy reluctantly gives Don a lift. She claims to be a theatre actress and expresses disdain for film acting, particularly Don\\'s hammy performances. Don responds by mocking her acting aspirations, and they part on bad terms. Don arrives at the afterparty, where Monumental Pictures\\' CEO R. F. Simpson shows a demonstration of a talking picture, though his guests dismiss it as a fad. A group of chorus girls then performs, Kathy among them All I Do is Dream of You. Furious at Don\\'s teasing, Kathy throws a cake at him, but it hits Lina instead. In the confusion, Kathy runs away. Three weeks later, Don has searched unsuccessfully for Kathy. Cosmo tries to cheer Don up Make Em Laugh. Lina reveals that she had Kathy fired, infuriating Don. Cosmo finds Kathy working as an extra in another Monumental Pictures film Beautiful Girl. Kathy admits to actually being a fan of Don\\'s, while Don professes his love for her You Were Meant for Me. When Monumental\\'s rival, Warner Bros., releases its first talking picture, The Jazz Singer, an enormous hit, R. F. decides he has to convert the next Lockwood and Lamont film, The Dueling Cavalier, into a talkie. Lina and Don take elocution lessons Moses Supposes, but the production is beset with difficulties, most notably Lina\\'s grating, high-pitched voice and unfamiliarity with the new recording technology. The film\\'s preview screening is a failure due to multiple complications, including awkward microphone placements, Don\\'s uninspired improvising and the audio going out of synchronization. Later that night, Kathy and Cosmo suggest The Dueling Cavalier be turned into a musical Good Morning, and Cosmo, inspired by the film\\'s synchronization error, suggests that Kathy dub Lina\\'s voice. Don happily agrees, then takes Kathy home and dances through her neighborhood in the rain Singin\\' in the Rain. Don and Cosmo pitch their idea to R. F., changing the title of the film to The Dancing Cavalier and adding a modern framing device Broadway Melody. R. F. approves but tells them not to inform Lina of Kathy\\'s involvement. Don helps Kathy dub Lina\\'s lines Would You, but Lina is tipped off by another actress. When Lina realizes that Don and Kathy are in love and learns that R. F. intends to give Kathy a screen credit for her dubbing, she gives interviews across Hollywood promoting her non-existent vocal talent. A clause in Lina\\'s contract allows her to sue the studio for negative press, so R. F is forced to leave Kathy uncredited and agree to Lina\\'s demand that Kathy continue anonymously dubbing for her. The premiere of The Dancing Cavalier is a success, but when the audience clamors for Lina to sing live, Don, Cosmo, and R. F. tell her to lip sync into a microphone while Kathy, concealed behind the curtain, sings into a second microphone. While Lina is singing Singin\\' in the Rain Reprise, the men raise the curtain, revealing the ruse. Lina and Kathy both flee, but Don has the audience stop Kathy and proudly announces that she is the real star of the picture You Are My Lucky Star. Some time later, Kathy and Don kiss in front of a billboard for their new film, Singin\\' in the Rain.",

            "plot": "Kanji Watanabe has worked in the same monotonous, bureaucratic position in the Tokyo public works department for thirty years and is close to retirement. His wife is dead, and his son, Mitsuo, who lives with his wife in his fathers home, seems eager to claim both his fathers estate and lifetime pension. At work, hes a party to constant bureaucratic inaction. In one case, a group of parents who simply want permission to drain a cesspool so they can install a playground are endlessly routed to different offices in the same building.  After learning he has stomach cancer and less than a year to live, Watanabe attempts to come to terms with his impending death. He plans to tell Mitsuo about the cancer but decides against it when his son does not pay attention to him. He then tries to find escape in the pleasures of Tokyos nightlife, guided by an eccentric novelist whom he has just met. In a nightclub, Watanabe requests a song from the piano player, and sings Gondola no Uta with great sadness. His singing greatly affects those watching him. Later, he realizes that hedonistic pleasure is not the solution. The following day, Watanabe encounters Toyo, a young female subordinate, who needs his signature on her resignation. He takes comfort in observing her joyous love of life and enthusiasm, and he tries to spend as much time as possible with her. She eventually becomes suspicious of his intentions and grows wary of him. After persuading her to join him for the last time, he becomes open and asks for the secret to her love of life. She says that she does not know but that she found happiness in her new job making toys, which makes her feel as if she is playing with all the children of Japan. Inspired by her, Watanabe realizes that it is not too late for him to do something significant. Like Toyo, he wants to make something, but he is unsure what he can do within the city bureaucracy until he remembers the lobbying for a playground. He surprises everyone by returning to work after a long absence, and he begins pushing for a playground despite concerns that he is intruding on the jurisdiction of other departments. Watanabe dies, and at his wake, his former co-workers gather, after the opening of the playground, to figure out what caused such a dramatic change in his behavior. His transformation from listless bureaucrat to passionate advocate puzzles them. As the co-workers drink, they slowly realize that Watanabe must have known he was dying, even when his son denies this truth, as he was unaware of his fathers condition. They also hear from a witness that, in the last few moments in Watabes life, he sat on the swing at the park he built. As the snow fell, he sang Gondola no Uta. The bureaucrats vow to honor Watabes memory by following his example yet fall back into the same patterns as before the second they return to their offices.",

            "plot": "Wounded from a gunshot, insurance salesman Walter Neff stumbles into his Los Angeles office. He records a dictaphone confession for claims manager Barton Keyes.One year earlier, Neff flirts with Phyllis Dietrichson during a house call about her husband's automobile insurance. Phyllis asks about getting a policy on Mr. Dietrichson's life without his knowledge; deducing that she is contemplating murder, Neff wants no part of it but is fascinated with her. Later, Phyllis visits his apartment, where he concocts a plan to make Dietrichson sign a life insurance policy without realizing it, murder him, and frame it as an accident in order to trigger the policy's double indemnity clause.Neff has Dietrichson sign the policy by convincing him that it is a copy of his automotive insurance renewal, but Dietrichson unexpectedly breaks his leg before the murder can take place, delaying the scheme. Neff hides in the back seat of Phyllis' car while she drives Dietrichson to a train station. Neff breaks his neck and boards the train posing as the crippled Dietrichson. He jumps off the back of the train at a pre-arranged spot, where Phyllis helps him pose Dietrichson's body on the tracks.Neff's boss believes the death was a suicide. Keyes scoffs at the idea, which he considers statistically implausible, but does find it strange that Dietrichson did not file a claim after breaking his leg. He begins to suspect that Phyllis and an accomplice had him murdered. Reasoning that Dietrichson was not aware of the policy due to his not filing a claim on the broken leg, the company refuses to pay out. Meanwhile, Phyllis' stepdaughter Lola befriends Neff. She tells him that she saw Phyllis trying on mourning clothes several days before Dietrichson's death, and that she also suspects that Phyllis, a nurse, had killed her mother in order to marry Dietrichson. She now fears that Phyllis plans to kill her next.Keyes finds a witness who says that the man he saw on the train was not Dietrichson. Neff warns Phyllis that pursuing the insurance claim in court risks exposing the murder, and insists that they should not see each other until the investigation ends. Neff learns that Nino, Lola's ex-boyfriend, has been visiting Phyllis every night since the murder, and that Keyes suspects Nino of being her accomplice. Fearing for Lola's life, Neff goes to confront Phyllis.Neff tells Phyllis that he suspects her plan was to manipulate Nino into murdering Lola, and threatens to kill her. Phyllis shoots him, but when he comes closer and dares her to shoot again, she does not; she says that she never loved him until a minute ago, when I couldn't fire that second shot. As they embrace, Neff shoots her twice with her gun. As Neff leaves, he sees Nino walk up to the house; he convinces him to call Lola and make up with her.Neff finishes recording his confession and looks up to see Keyes watching him. Telling Keyes that he plans to flee to Mexico, he walks out of the office but collapses in the doorway. Keyes calls for an ambulance and the police, and the two wait for them to arrive.",

            "plot": "In a mansion called Xanadu, part of a vast palatial estate in Florida, the elderly Charles Foster Kane is on his deathbed. Holding a snow globe, he utters his last word, Rosebud, and dies. A newsreel obituary tells the life story of Kane, an enormously wealthy newspaper publisher and industry magnate. Kane\\'s death becomes sensational news around the world, and the newsreel\\'s producer tasks reporter Jerry Thompson with discovering the meaning of Rosebud.Thompson sets out to interview Kane\\'s friends and associates. He tries to approach Kane\\'s second wife, Susan Alexander Kane, now an alcoholic who runs her nightclub, but she refuses to talk to him. Thompson goes to the private archive of the late banker Walter Parks Thatcher. Through Thatcher\\'s written memoirs, Thompson learns about Kane\\'s rise from a Colorado boarding house and the decline of his fortune.In 1871, gold was discovered through a mining deed belonging to Kane\\'s mother, Mary Kane. She hired Thatcher to establish a trust that would provide for Kane\\'s education and assume guardianship of him. While the parents and Thatcher discussed arrangements inside the boarding house, the young Kane played happily with a sled in the snow outside. When Kane\\'s parents introduced him to Thatcher, the boy struck Thatcher with his sled and attempted to run away.By the time Kane gained control of his trust at the age of 25, the mine\\'s productivity and Thatcher\\'s prudent investing had made Kane one of the richest men in the world. Kane took control of the New York Inquirer newspaper and embarked on a career of yellow journalism, publishing scandalous articles that attacked Thatcher\\'s (and his own) business interests. Kane sold his newspaper empire to Thatcher after the 1929 stock market crash left him short of cash.Thompson interviews Kane\\'s personal business manager, Mr. Bernstein. Bernstein recalls that Kane hired the best journalists available to build the Inquirer\\'s circulation. Kane rose to power by successfully manipulating public opinion regarding the Spanish\u2013American War and marrying Emily Norton, the niece of the President of the United States.Thompson interviews Kane\\'s estranged best friend, Jedediah Leland, in a retirement home. Leland says that Kane\\'s marriage to Emily disintegrated over the years, and he began an affair with amateur singer Susan Alexander while running for Governor of New York. Both his wife and his political opponent discovered the affair, and the public scandal ended his political career. Kane married Susan and forced her into a humiliating career as an opera singer (for which she had neither the talent nor the ambition). Kane arranged for a large opera house to be built in Chicago for Susan to perform in. After Leland began to write a negative review of Susan\\'s disastrous opera debut, Kane fired him but finished the negative review and printed it. Susan protested that she never wanted the opera career anyway, but Kane forced her to continue the season.Susan consents to an interview with Thompson and describes the aftermath of her opera career. She attempted suicide, and Kane finally allowed her to abandon singing. After many unhappy years living at Xanadu with Kane, the two had an argument that culminated in Kane slapping Susan. Susan decided to leave Kane. Kane\\'s butler Raymond recounts that, after Susan moved out of Xanadu, Kane began violently destroying the contents of her former bedroom. When Kane discovered a snow globe, he calmed down and tearfully said Rosebud. Thompson concludes that he cannot solve the mystery and that the meaning of Kane\\'s last word will remain unknown.At Xanadu, Kane\\'s belongings are cataloged or discarded by the mansion\\'s staff. They find a sled, the one on which eight-year-old Kane was playing on the day that he was taken from his home in Colorado, and throw it into a furnace with other items. Unknown to the staff, the sled\\'s trade name, printed on top, becomes visible through the flames: Rosebud.",

under intense pressure The bottle of champagne only fuels Raghavs worries as to what will happen if he does not make it The next day while checking the results at his friends apartment Raghav finds out that he has not qualified for IITJEE exam results and afraid of being called a loser he deliberately slips off the balcony to commit suicide but survives although in a fatal state Anni rushes to

deteriorating as Raghav does not have the will to live Realizing that his son is afraid of being called a loser Anni who stumbles upon pictures of his college days begins to recount the tales of his time in college in an attempt to rekindle hope in Raghav who he wants to believe that his father too was once a loserDuring the recount the story flashes back to 1992 when it was his first day of college at the IIT BombayNational College of Technology campus Anni is allotted a room in Hostel 4 aka H4 which is famous for housing losers The occupants of H4 have earned this tag for numerous unknown reasons one of them being the poorest quality of mess food on the entire campus Dissatisfied he applies to change his hostel block although a clerk informs him that his application might take time Meanwhile a senior H4 student Gurmeet Sexa Singh Dhillon pokes Anni in the butt the first time they meet but they soon become friends with Anni describing Sexa as a hypersexual senior who was obsessed with pornography all the timeAt this point Raghav has a convulsion causing Anni and Maya to panic but Dr Kasbekar reveals that he is now conscious though his condition is still the same When he asks about Sexa though Anni convinced that Raghav was listening goes in with Maya to meet Raghav who doubts if it is indeed a true story Anni convinced that he just needs proof to make his plan work eventually traces Sexa who is currently working as a consultant in London through a call and informs him about the tragedy Sexa postpones his work commitments for the week and flies down to Mumbai to reunite with Anni and Maya and seeing Sexa an initially dismayed Raghav recognizes him and puts all his doubts to rest as Sexa continues with the storySexa narrates Annis desperation to change his hostel and in 1992 during their initial conversation at a canteen they notice Maya for the first timeAs the story returns to the present Sexa narrates to Anni and Maya during a lunch break how he and a friend named Himanshu Acid Deshmukh once received a funny proragging request in 1992 from the father of a fresher named Sundar Mummy Shrivastava a young introvert who is tied to his mothers apron strings and is very dependent on her At this stage Mummy joins Sexa in the present day working as an executive in the United States which has thickened his accent When both Anni and Sexa spill news of Acids arrival Mummy exclaims to Raghav that Acid is bad news Anni then describes Acid as a school topper who began flunking his college tests and developed a bitter swearing tongue A brief introduction for Acid soon pans back to Sexas classmate joining them in the hospital All of them briefly reminisce about the fun they had in their college days showing their photo album to Raghav and telling him about Annis newfound relationship with Maya back then even as Dr Kasbekar time and again informs them that Raghavs brain is swelling and his condition doesnt show signs of improvementMeanwhile back in 1992 a super senior student named Raghuvir Raggie Chalkar a reputed hostelite of Hostel 3 aka H3 which is known to be a worldclass hostel and the absolute antithesis of H4 fasttracks Annis application and offers him to come to H3 but Anni has a sudden change of heart while discussing this with Maya later rejecting the offer much to the chagrin of Raggie who reveals that H4 super senior Derek DSouza a wellknown athlete has been rotting for the past three years after having similarly rejected a previous offerDerek is revealed to be a chain smoker and as he reunites with Anni a scene of their first meeting back in 1992 plays out wherein Derek reveals that Raggie is a fullblown college bully who inducts talented students from other hostels into H3 and claims total credit for winning GC An initially surprised Anni soon learns that H4s loser status comes from its consistently worst performances over the years in the GC which stands for General Championship an annual sports competition whence students of all 10 hostels of the entire institute compete in 30 sports over 2 months Anni then convinces an initially skeptical Derek to try for one last time and they begin a series of trials hilariously failing in the bargain After multiple attempts to find the right players fail Derek gives the same reply to Anni as one that Dr Kasbekar gives to him and Maya that it has to be all about trying for theres no other wayBack at Annis house everyone is having a discussion where Derek Acid Sexa and Mummy tell Anni and Maya that theyll be sticking around to support them after Anni requests them to leave due to the negative reports of Raghavs health when just before everyone can assemble for dinner on the dining table Anni and the losers find their longmissing member Sahil Bevda Awasthi at Annis doorstep Bevda joins the group at the hospital the next day and as is implied he is shown to be the Devdas2002 Hindi filmDevdasinspired drunkard of the group also a known chess championThey then recount that while preparing for the GC back in 1992 as they lose an initial string of matches in different sports except carrom tournaments where Mummy leads them to the quarterfinals all six boys decide to sacrifice things closest to them until they win the GC Anni in his bid decides to temporarily boycott Maya avoiding her constantly However this tactic hits back severely on their faces when Bevda has a relapse and is taken to the hospital causing the H4 team to lose hope However after a moment of introspection Anni soon comes up with a trifecta of plans to defeat other hostels His methods work resulting in several massive victories for H4 During a celebration hang out at a bar however a violent clash between Raggies gang and the leading losers culminates in Mummy injuring his finger causing Mummy to lose the carrom semifinals Even as Acid consoles a crying Mummy lack of representation in a weightlifting tournament instantly strikes an idea in Annis head and he chooses Abhimanyu Danda Rathore an H4 hostelite to lose 2 kgs through training under Anni and Dereks supervision and compete in the 42 kg category His hilarious victory is soon accompanied by Bewdas return from rehab which the hostel celebrates Bevda continues to reign in points for H4 in chess after his return Dereks athletic skills prove a great asset for H4 and eventually H4 makes it to the finals pitted against H3 for the first time in college historyBack in the present Dr Kasbekar asks Anni Maya and their friends to leave Raghav at this point so that he can have his surgical operation done the next morning and they all promise Raghav to wait patiently for the climax After the friends return to Annis home the friends have a discussion where Anni reveals that he probably failed in teaching Raghav how to deal with failures pointing to the bottle of champagne he had bought for him Seeing Mummy call up his son Vedant and tell him that he will gift him a bike irrespective of what his exam results would be Maya surmises that Anni is an exceptional father and reconciles with him after an emotional breakdown Right in the middle of the night Annis phone suddenly rings wherein Dr Kasbekar informs him that Raghav has had severe convulsions and an immediate operation would have to be carried out Anni requests 10 minutes for finishing the story and Dr Kasbekar initially reluctant gives in after Maya supports himThey resume the story where back in 1992 a vexed Raggie upon learning of H4s methods decides to sabotage Bevda by offering him a bottle of alcoholic drinkalcohol and deliberately has his teammate injure Dereks foot Bevda initially appears to be drunk when Anni and Sexa are to receive him and after Anni departs for the basketball final tends to move towards a loss in the game when he suddenly reveals that he isnt drunk and that he had let his opponent make a huge mistake sacrificing his knight Eventually with both Acid and Derek winning the relay final Bevda also wins the chess tournament They reunite with Anni at the basketball court and while Anni gets a penalty shot and aims for a 3pointer his shot misses by almost an inch causing H4 to lose the GC by a close marginBack in the present Raghav is shocked at this moment of loss and asks Anni if he felt like committing suicide at that moment having lost a battle this close Anni Derek Mummy Acid Sexa Bevda and Maya take turns in replying with a NO as Anni then explains in a flashback to 1992 that Raggie publicly called them champs instead of losers for the first time creating a loud wave of cheer for H4 and congratulating the team for putting up a good fight Anni then explains to Raghav that the H4 hostelites were never called losers again and that it is not ones results that decide whether he or she is a loser but rather ones efforts Convincing him that he tried very hard Anni asks Raghav to put up a strong face and fight all his challenges in life including the operation and as he is being taken to the operation theatre Raghav visualizes Anni Derek Mummy Acid Sexa Bevda and Maya in their younger selves cheering him to fight onA year later a fully recovered Raghav attends his first day of college requesting the viewers to never ask what the name of his college is or what his rank was since he is content that he is getting to live life and enjoy it the maximum As he reaches the new campus he laughs at his seniors question as grownup apparitions of his parents and the rest of the losers look at him",

            "plot": "In the fictional town of Ebbing, Missouri, Mildred Hayes is grieving over the rape and murder of her teen daughter, Angela, seven months earlier. Angry over the lack of progress in the investigation, she rents three disused billboards near her home and posts on them. They attract attention, so Bill Willoughby, the local chief of police, visits Mildred, but is unable to persuade her to take them down, even by revealing he has terminal pancreatic cancer. He renews his efforts to solve the case, but does not get anywhere.Many townspeople are upset by the billboards, including Jason Dixon, an alcoholic police officer, who unsuccessfully tries to intimidate Red Welby, who rented Mildred the billboards, into taking them down. Mildreds dentist is sympathetic to Willoughby and menaces her during an appointment, so she drills a hole in his thumbnail. Willoughby brings her in for questioning and accidentally coughs up blood into her face. He has her released and is hospitalized, though he soon checks himself out against medical advice.The billboards have further strained Mildreds relationship with her son, Robbie, and she recalls that her last interaction with Angela was an argument during which she lashed back by saying she hoped she was raped. Her abusive ex-cop ex-husband Charlie confronts her about the billboards and ends up revealing that, shortly before Angelas murder, he had turned down her request to come live with him.At his mothers suggestion, Dixon arrests Mildreds friend Denise on trivial drug possession charges to put pressure on Mildred. Willoughby spends an idyllic day with his wife, Anne, and their two daughters, and then commits suicide later that night to spare his family from watching him die slowly. Dixon reacts to the news by assaulting Welby and throwing him out a second-story window. This is witnessed by Abercrombie, Willoughbys replacement, who fires Dixon.Before his death, Willoughby wrote several letters, including one to Mildred. Anne delivers it, interrupting an unknown man who was menacing Mildred at work. In the letter, Willoughby tells Mildred that she was not a factor in his suicide, asserts he was dedicated to finding Angelas killer and reveals he secretly paid to keep the billboards up another month.After the billboards are destroyed by arson, Mildred retaliates by tossing Molotov cocktails at the police station, which she believes to be unoccupied for the night. However, Dixon is inside reading Willoughbys letter to him, which advises him to let go of hate and embrace love if he wants to be a detective someday; he manages to escape the blaze with Angelas case file. James, an acquaintance of Mildred, happens by and extinguishes Dixons burning clothes before providing Mildred with an alibi. Dixon is put in the same hospital room as Welby, to whom he apologizes.Jerome, who was part of the team that put up the billboards, brings Mildred a set of copies and helps her restore the signs. Discharged from the hospital, Dixon overhears the man who menaced Mildred bragging in a bar about raping a girl in the same manner as Angela. He notes the number on the mans Idaho license plate and then scratches the mans face to get a DNA sample, passively accepting the resulting beating.Mildred is on a date with James to thank him for his help, when Charlie enters with his 19-year-old girlfriend Penelope and apologizes for burning the billboards when he was drunk. Unnerved that she retaliated against the wrong target, Mildred abruptly calls off the date, but James misinterprets her decision as embarrassment to be seen with him and leaves the restaurant incensed.Abercrombie informs Dixon that the DNA sample is not a match and the man was overseas on military duty at the time of Angelas death. Dixon gives Mildred the disappointing news and, believing the man to be guilty of some other rape, the pair plan a trip to Idaho to kill him. As they set out, Mildred confesses that she set the police station on fire, which Dixon had already assumed. They both express uncertainty about their mission, but Mildred says they can decide what to do along the way.",

            "plot": "Georgekutty started out as an orphan who had dropped out of school after his 4th year. He is now a businessman running a cable television service in the village of Rajakkad. He is married to Rani and they have two daughters Anju and Anu. His only interest apart from his family is watching films, as he spends most of his time in front of the TV in his small office. Due to his knowledge of his films, he is respected by the locals. During a nature camp, Anju gets photographed in the bathroom by a hidden cell phone held by Varun Prabhakar, who is the son of Inspector General of Police Geetha Prabhakar. Varun meets Anju and blackmails her to have sex with him. That same night, he arrives at their house, but Rani is informed by Anju and pleads Varun to leave Anju alone. He agrees on the condition that Rani have sex with him instead. In a successful attempt to destroy Varuns phone, Anju accidentally strikes Varun in the head, killing him. They bury his body in a compost pit, which is witnessed by Anu. Rani informs Georgekutty about the incident and he devises a way to save his family from the police. He removes the broken phone and disposes of Varuns car, which is seen by the local police constable Sahadevan, who hold a grudge against Georgekutty. As Georgekutty takes his family on a trip to attend a religious retreat, a movie and a restaurant, Geetha starts an investigation upon learning that Varun has gone missing. After a preliminary investigation, Geetha calls Georgekutty and his family for questioning. Georgekutty had predicted that this would happen and taught his family how to change their alibi at the time of murder. When questioned individually, they reply the same thing and they had also shown the bill of the restaurant, the movies and bus journey tickets as a proof of their alibi. Geetha questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Georgekuttys alibi. However, Geetha realises that on the day of the incident, Georgekutty had taken the tickets and the bill, made acquaintance with the owners and had gone for the trip with his family the next day, thus proving his alibi and making the owners unwittingly tell the lie. Georgekutty and his family are arrested and Sahadevan brutally tortures them, including Anu to make the truth come out. Geetha learns from Varuns friend Alex about Anjus video created by Varun. Eventually, Anu gives in and reveals the place where the body is buried. After digging the compost pit, they find the carcass of a cow, indicating that Georgekutty had moved the body. Before Geetha and Sahadevan could react to it, Georgekutty and Anu goes to the media and complains of Sahedevans torture against his family. Enraged, Sahadevan tries to attack the family again, but Ranis brother Rajesh and the villagers saves them and subdues Sahadevan, who later ends up being suspended while Geetha resigns from her post. Geetha and her husband Prabhakar meet Georgekutty to ask forgiveness for their rude and violent behavior and of their sons perverted behaviour, but Georgekutty suspects there might be foul play involved and still does not reveal directly about Varuns death. Georgekutty, now in remand, signs a register at the newly constructed local police station and leaves. As the police inspector tells him that he will find the body and that the police are not fools, Georgekutty replies by telling the officer he believes that the police are there to help the people. As he exits the police station, it is revealed that Georgekutty had buried Varuns body beneath the police station.",

            "plot": "The film starts in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, in which Milkha Singh is competing in the 400metres race. His coach yells Bhaag Milkha Bhaag Run, Milkha, run, and Singh is suddenly taken back to childhood memories that haunt him, causing him to drop to fourth place. His memories are full of the chaos surrounding the 1947 Partition of India, which resulted in mass religious violence in Punjab and the killing of Singhs parents. The flashback shows Singh arriving in Delhi alone, where he later meets his sister. Living in impoverished refugee camps, Milkha makes friends and survives by stealing. Now grown up, he falls in love with Biro, who asks him to live a life of honesty. Milkha soon finds himself in the army. There, he wins a race in which the top 10 runners are rewarded with milk, two eggs, and are excused from fatigue duty; his running skills are noticed by a havaldar sergeant. He gets selected for service commission, where he is frustrated. On the day before selection of the Indian team for the Olympics, Singh is beaten up by senior players whom he had previously defeated. Despite being injured, he participates in the race and overcomes his pain; he wins the race and breaks the national record. Proud of his achievement, Milkha goes back to Delhi to ask for Biros hand in marriage. However, his friend informs him that Biro was married and left Delhi. During the Melbourne 1956 Olympics, Singh is attracted to Stella, the granddaughter of his Australian technical coach. After a frolicking night in a bar, they have a one-night stand. The following day, he feels exhausted and comes late to the training the next day. Singh loses the final race. He realizes his mistake and, slaps himself in front of a mirror. On the flight back to India, he asks his coach what the world record is for the 400m race and learns that it is 459 seconds. A montage of tyre training in the cold desert of the Himalayas is depicted, wherein Milkha Singh pushes himself to the brink of absolute exhaustion. He subsequently enters the 1958 Asian Games with the hope of winning Gold for India. He then sees Abdul Khaliq, dubbed the Fastest Man of Asia. After Abdul wins his race, Milkha Singh approaches him to congratulate the victor. However, the Pakistani coach and his athlete shun him. But in the 200m, he defeats Khaliq by a considerable margin. Moving to the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, he wins another Gold in the 400m and is named The King of England by various newspapers. After celebrating his victory along with his teammates in the army, he burns the paper on which the time of 459 seconds was written. He finally achieves his life-long dream by breaking the 400m world record. Invited by the prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, to lead the Indian team in Pakistan for a friendly race with Abdul Khaliq, Singh adamantly refuses to go due to the trauma of having to flee his home in the newly formed Pakistan as a child. The prime minister learns of Singhs opposition but ultimately convinces him to go. Arriving in Pakistan, Singh misses the press conference and goes to his village where, it is shown how his parents were murdered and the last words of his father were Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. He starts crying and is comforted by a boy who turns out to be the son of his childhood friend, Sampreet. He then meets Sampreet. In the games, initially, Khaliq is winning, but Singh takes the lead after overtaking opponents one by one. Impressed how easily Singh passed the Pakistani athlete and won by a humongous margin, the president of Pakistan, General Ayub Khan, gives him the title of The Flying Sikh. Jawaharlal Nehru declares a day in the name of Milkha as a national holiday as requested by Singh himself. A final sequence of Milkha Singh is depicted where he is enjoying his victory lap and everybody in the stadium is in awe of what he has achieved. He sees his younger self running beside him, as the film ends.",

            "plot": "Chak De! India opens in Delhi during the final minutes of a Hockey World Cup match between Pakistan and India, with Pakistan leading 1\u20130. When Indian team captain Kabir Khan is fouled, he takes a penalty stroke. His shot just misses, causing India to lose the match. Soon afterwards, media outlets circulate a photograph of Khan shaking hands and embracing the Pakistani captain. The sporting gesture is misunderstood, and Khan is suspected of throwing the game out of sympathy towards Pakistan. Religious prejudice forces him and his mother to leave town.Seven years later Mr. Tripathi, the head of Indias hockey association, meets with field hockey advocate Uttam Singh to discuss the Indian womens hockey team. According to Tripathi, the team has no future since the only long-term role for women is to cook and clean. Uttam, however, tells him that Khan wants to coach the team. Initially skeptical, Tripathi agrees to the arrangement.Khan finds himself in charge of a group of 16 young women divided by their fiercely competitive natures and regional prejudices. Komal Chautala, a village girl from Haryana, clashes with Preeti Sabarwal from Chandigarh; short-tempered Balbir Kaur from Punjab bullies Rani Dispotta and Soimoi Kerketa, who are from remote villages in Jharkhand. Mary Ralte from Mizoram and Molly Zimik, from Manipur in Northeast India, face widespread racial discrimination, and sexual comments from some strangers. Team Captain Vidya Sharma must choose between hockey and the wishes of her husbands familys, and Preetis fianc\u00e9\u2014Abhimanyu Singh, Vice-Captain of the India national cricket team\u2014 brushes off hockey as unimportant to their future as a couple.Khan realises that he can make the girls winners only if he can help them overcome their differences. During his first few days as coach, he benches several players who refuse to follow his rules\u2014including Bindiya Naik, the most experienced player. In response, Bindiya repeatedly encourages the other players to defy Khan. When she finally succeeds, Khan angrily resigns; however, he invites the staff and team to a farewell lunch at McDonalds. During the lunch, local boys eve tease Mary; Balbir attacks them, triggering a brawl between the boys and the team. Khan, recognising that they are finally acting as one for the first time, prevents the staff from intervening; he only stops a man from hitting one of the women from behind with a cricket bat. After the fight, the women realise Khans intentions and ask him to remain their coach.The team faces new challenges. When Tripathi refuses to send the womens team to Australia for the World Cup, Khan proposes a match against the mens team. Although his team loses, their performance inspires Tripathi to send them to Australia after all. Bindiya is upset with Khan for choosing Vidya over her as the captain of the team. Her consequent behaviour results in a 7\u20130 loss to Australia. When Khan confronts Bindiya about her actions on the field, Bindiya responds by attempting to seduce Khan, to which he rejects  asks her to stay away from the game. Khan goes on to train the girls again, which is followed by victories over England, Spain, South Africa, New Zealand, and Argentina. Just before their game with South Korea, Khan approaches Bindiya, asking her to begin playing once more and break the strategy of Man to Man marking used by the Korean team so they can win the match. Bindiya goes onto the field and with the help of Gunjan Lakhani manages to beat South Korea and enter the finals.They are again matched with Australia for the final. Khan urges Komal and Preeti to put aside their differences for the teams sake. Preeti, in order to prove Abhimanyu a point, is determined to finish as the tournaments leading goal scorer. In the final few minutes of the game, the Indian women are trailing 1-2 when Komal passes the ball to Preeti, who scores and pushes the game into penalty shootouts. There, they go down 2-0 initially but come back to win the penalty shootouts 3-2 and thus claim the world cup against all odds. When the team returns home, their families treat them with greater respect and Khan, his good name restored, returns with his mother to their town and ancestral home.",

            "plot": "In 1898, Daniel Plainview finds silver while prospecting in New Mexico but breaks his leg. Dragging himself from the pit, he takes a sample to an assay office and receives a silver and gold claim. In 1902, he discovers oil in California. Following the death of a worker in an accident, Daniel adopts the mans orphaned son, H.W. The boy becomes his partner, allowing Daniel to present himself as a family man. In 1911, Daniel is approached by Paul Sunday, a young man who tells him of an oil deposit in Little Boston. Daniel visits the Sundays property in Little Boston and meets Pauls brother Eli, a preacher. Daniel attempts to purchase the farm from the Sundays at a bargain price under the ruse of using it to hunt quail, but his motives are questioned by Eli, who knows the land has oil. In exchange for the property, Eli demands 10000 for his church. An agreement is made and Daniel acquires all the available land in and around the Sunday property, save for one holdout, William Bandy. After Daniel reneges on an agreement to let Eli bless the well before drilling begins, a series of misfortunes occur: an accident kills one worker and a gas blowout deafens H.W. and destroys the drilling infrastructure. When Eli publicly demands the money still owed to him, Daniel beats him. At the dinner table that night, Eli attacks and berates his father for having trusted Daniel. A man arrives at Daniels doorstep claiming to be his half-brother, Henry. Later that night H.W. sets fire to their house, intending to kill Henry. Daniel sends H.W. to a school for the deaf in San Francisco. Standard Oil offers to buy out Daniels local interests, but Daniel refuses and instead strikes a deal with Union Oil to build a pipeline. However, Bandys ranch remains an impediment. Daniel becomes suspicious of Henry after he fails to recognize a joke and confronts him one night at gunpoint. Henry confesses that he was a friend of the real Henry, who died of tuberculosis, and that he had impersonated Henry in the hope that Daniel could give him a job. An enraged Daniel murders him and buries his body. Daniel drinks and weeps. The next morning, Daniel is awakened by Bandy, who knows of Daniels crime and wants him to publicly repent in Elis church in exchange for an easement to run his pipeline across the ranch. As part of his baptism, Eli humiliates Daniel and coerces him into confessing that he abandoned his child.

            "plot": "In a fairy tale, Princess Moanna, whose father is the king of the underworld, visits the human world, where the sunlight blinds her and erases her memory. She becomes mortal and eventually dies. The king believes that eventually, her spirit will return to the underworld, so he builds labyrinths around the world which act as portals, in preparation for her return.In 1944 Francoist Spain, ten-year-old Ofelia travels with her pregnant mother Carmen to meet Captain Vidal, her new stepfather. Vidal, a Civil Guard officer and devotee of Falangism, has been assigned to hunt down the Spanish Maquis. A large stick insect, which Ofelia believes to be a fairy, leads Ofelia into an ancient stone labyrinth, but she is stopped by Vidal\\'s housekeeper Mercedes, who is secretly supporting her brother Pedro and other members of the Maquis. That night, the insect appears in Ofelia\\'s bedroom, where it transforms into a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth. There, she meets a faun, who believes she is the reincarnation of Princess Moanna. He gives her a book and tells her she will find in it three tasks to complete in order for her to acquire immortality and return to her kingdom.Ofelia completes the first task \u2014 retrieving a key from the belly of a giant toad \u2014 but becomes worried about her mother, whose condition is worsening. The faun gives Ofelia a mandrake root, instructing her to keep it under Carmen\\'s bed and regularly supply it with blood, which seems to ease Carmen\\'s illness. Accompanied by three fairy guides and equipped with a piece of magic chalk, Ofelia then completes the second task \u2014 retrieving a dagger from the lair of the Pale Man, a child-eating monster. Warned not to consume anything there, she eats two grapes, awakening the Pale Man. He devours two of the fairies and chases Ofelia, but she manages to escape. Infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give Ofelia the third task.During this time, Ofelia becomes aware of Vidal\\'s ruthlessness in the course of hunting down the Maquis. After killing two local farmers, Vidal interrogates and tortures a captive member of the Maquis. He asks Doctor Ferreiro to tend to the captive, whom Ferreiro then euthanises at his own urging. Realising that Ferreiro is collaborating with the Maquis, Vidal kills him. He later catches Ofelia tending to the mandrake root, which Vidal considers delusional. Carmen agrees and throws the root into the fire. She immediately develops painful contractions and dies giving birth to Vidal\\'s son.A discovered spy, Mercedes tries to escape with Ofelia, but they are caught. Ofelia is locked in her bedroom, while Mercedes is taken to be interrogated. Mercedes frees herself, and stabs Vidal non-lethally in her escape to re-join the Maquis. The faun, having changed his mind about giving Ofelia a chance to perform the third task, returns and tells her to bring her newborn brother into the labyrinth to complete it. Ofelia retrieves the baby and flees into the labyrinth. Vidal pursues her as the Maquis launch an attack on a Civil Guard outpost. Ofelia meets the faun at the centre of the labyrinth. The faun suggests drawing a small amount of the baby\\'s blood, as completing the third task and opening the portal to the underworld requires the blood of an innocent, but Ofelia refuses to harm her brother. Vidal finds her talking to the faun, whom he cannot see. The faun leaves, and Vidal takes the baby from Ofelia\\'s arms before shooting her. Vidal returns to the labyrinth\\'s entrance, where he is surrounded by the Maquis, including Mercedes and Pedro. Knowing that he will be killed, he hands the baby to Mercedes, asking that his son be told the time of his father\\'s death. Mercedes replies that his son will not even know his name, before Pedro shoots Vidal dead.Mercedes enters the labyrinth and comforts a dying Ofelia. Drops of Ofelia\\'s blood fall down the centre of the spiral stone staircase onto an altar. Ofelia, well dressed and uninjured, then appears in a golden throne room. The King of the underworld tells her that, by choosing to spill her own blood rather than that of another, she passed the final test. The faun praises Ofelia for her choice, addressing her as Your Highness. The Queen of the underworld, her mother, invites Ofelia to sit next to her father and rule at his side. Back in the stone labyrinth, Ofelia smiles as she dies.The epilogue completes the tale of Princess Moanna, stating that she returned to the Underworld, ruled with kindness and justice for many centuries, and left little traces of her time in the human realm, visible only to those who know where to look.",

James oversaw the capture and execution of the three freedom fighters \u2013 Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru \u2013 at the Lahore Jail and has written in his diary about his admiration for their revolutionary spirit, in spite of his being an officer of the British Empire.Inspired by the revolutionaries story, Sue decides to make a film on them. She travels to India, where she searches for actors with the help of her local associate Sonia, a student of international studies at the University of Delhi. Following a string of unsuccessful auditions, Sue meets Sonias friends: Daljit DJ Singh, Karan Singhania, Sukhi Ram, and Aslam Khan. She immediately decides to cast them in her film, with DJ as Chandra Shekhar Azad, Karan Singhania as Bhagat Singh, Aslam Khan as Ashfaqulla Khan, and Sukhi Ram as Shivaram Rajguru.DJ, Aslam, Sukhi, and the spendthrift Karan, who is the son of politically well-connected businessman Rajnath Singhania, are at once carefree and cynical about their futures. While they get along well with Sue, they remain uninterested in working on a film expressing patriotism towards India. Tensions arise when Sue casts the boys rival, the rightwing party activist Laxman Pandey, as Ram Prasad Bismil. However, over the course of working on the film, Pandey grows closer to the others. Sue begins a relationship with DJ.The group becomes devastated when Sonias fianc\u00e9, Ajay Singh Rathod, a flight lieutenant in the Indian Air Force, is killed when his MiG21 jet malfunctions and crashes. The government attributes the accident to pilot error and closes the case, but Sonia and her friends refuse to accept the official explanation, knowing that Ajay was a skilled pilot who died while steering the plane away from crashing into a populous city. They learn that the corrupt Defense Minister Shastri signed a contract importing cheap parts for MiG21 aircraft in exchange for a personal favor. Karan is severely jolted when he realizes that his father Rajnath was involved in orchestrating the deal.Since working on the film has already made them imbibe idealism and galvanized them against government corruption, the group organizes a peaceful protest at the India Gate. The police arrive and violently break up the demonstration; Ajays mother, Aishwarya, is beaten by the police and goes into a coma. Laxman realizes that his senior party official, Raghuvir Mishra, was in league with the government officials who ordered the police to stop the protest and became disillusioned with his party. Inspired by the revolutionaries, the group decides to take action themselves. They assassinate Shastri to avenge Ajays death, while Karan confronts and murders Rajnath.The media reports that Shastri was killed by terrorists and celebrates him as a martyr. The group decides to publicly clarify their intent behind the assassination, and towards this end, they take over the All India Radio station after evacuating its employees and after alerting Karans friend Rahul, who works there and is live on air at the moment. Karan goes on air and calls out the defense ministrys corruption to the public. The police arrive at the station under instructions to kill them. Sukhi is shot dead, while Aslam and Laxman are killed by a grenade, and DJ is severely injured. DJ reunites with Karan in the recording room as the latter finishes his public statement, and the two of them get killed together.News of the boys deaths enrages the public, spurring a wave of demonstrations against the government.

            "plot": "In Gotham City, after falling down a well and getting swarmed by bats, a young Bruce Wayne develops a fear of them. At the opera with his parents, Bruce becomes unsettled by performers masquerading as bats and asks to leave. Outside, mugger Joe Chill murders Bruce\\'s parents in front of him. Bruce is raised by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Fourteen years later, Chill testifies against the mafia crime boss, Carmine Falcone, and is paroled. Bruce intends to murder Chill to avenge his parents, but one of Falcone\\'s hitmen does so first. Bruce\\'s childhood friend, Rachel Dawes, berates him for acting outside the justice system. After confronting Falcone, who says real power comes from being feared, Bruce spends the next seven years traveling the world, training in combat, and immersing himself in the criminal underworld. In a Bhutan prison, he is approached by Henri Ducard, who recruits him to the League of Shadows, led by Ra\\'s al Ghul. The League believes Gotham is beyond saving and intends to destroy it. After completing his training, Bruce rejects the League and its mandate that killing is necessary. He escapes, burning down their temple in the process. Ra\\'s is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves the unconscious Ducard. Intent on fighting crime, Bruce returns to Gotham and takes an interest in his family\\'s company, Wayne Enterprises, which is being taken public by businessman William Earle. Company archivist Lucius Fox, a friend of Bruce\\'s father, allows him access to prototype defense technologies, including a protective bodysuit and the Tumbler, an armored vehicle. Bruce poses publicly as a shallow playboy while setting up a base in the caves beneath Wayne Manor and taking up the vigilante identity of Batman, inspired by his childhood fear, which he has now conquered. Intercepting a drug shipment, Batman provides Rachel, now a Gotham Assistant District Attorney, with evidence against Falcone and enlists Sergeant James Gordon, one of Gotham\\'s few honest police officers, to arrest him. In prison, Falcone meets Dr. Jonathan Crane, a corrupt psychologist who smuggled drugs into Gotham with his help. Donning a scarecrow mask, Crane sprays Falcone with a fear-inducing hallucinogen, driving him insane and transferring him to Arkham Asylum. While investigating Crane, Batman is ambushed by him and sprayed with the hallucinogen. Batman barely escapes and is saved by Alfred and Fox, who develop an antidote for the hallucinogen. When Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, he reveals he has introduced his drug into Gotham\\'s water supply and drugs her with the hallucinogen. Batman later subdues Crane and sprays him with his own chemical. While being interrogated, Crane claims to work for Ra\\'s al Ghul. Batman evades the police to get Rachel to safety and administers the antidote. He gives her two vials: one for Gordon and the other for mass production. At Bruce\\'s birthday party, Ducard reappears and reveals himself to be the true Ra\\'s al Ghul. Having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from Wayne Enterprises, he plans to vaporize Gotham\\'s water supply, rendering Crane\\'s drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city. He sets Wayne Manor aflame and leaves Bruce to die, but Alfred rescues him. Ra\\'s loads the emitter onto Gotham\\'s monorail train to release the drug at the city\\'s central water source. Batman rescues Rachel from a drugged mob and reveals his identity to her. He confronts Ra\\'s on the train as Gordon uses the Tumbler\\'s cannons to destroy a section of the track. Batman escapes the train and leaves Ra\\'s to die as it crashes. Bruce gains Rachel\\'s respect. However, she refuses to be with him, promising they can be together when Gotham no longer needs Batman. Batman becomes a public hero. After purchasing a controlling stake in Wayne Enterprises, Bruce fires Earle and replaces him with Fox. Sergeant Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant, shows Batman the BatSignal, and tells him about a criminal who leaves behind Joker playing cards. Batman promises to look into it and disappears into the night.",

The game, however, is rigged and they wind up owing 500,000 to Harry, to be paid within a week. Harry sends his debt collector Big Chris to Eddies father JD, since Harrys true intention is to acquire JDs bar in payment of the debt. Also interested in two expensive antique Holland  Holland shotguns up for auction, Harry gets his enforcer Barry the Baptist to hire two thieves, Gary and Dean, to steal them from a bankrupt lord. After the incompetent thieves unwittingly sell them to Nick the Greek, a local fence, Barry threatens them into retrieving the guns. Meanwhile, Eddie returns home and overhears his neighbours, a gang of robbers led by a brutal man called Dog, planning a heist on some cannabis growers loaded with cash and drugs. He tells the other three and they decide to rob the neighbours after they return from their heist. Tom buys the shotguns from Nick both unaware of their true value, for use in the plan. Dogs gang execute their heist, and despite a gang members death by his own Bren gun and an incriminating encounter with a traffic warden, they succeed, returning with a duffel bag full of money and a van loaded with bags of cannabis. Eddie and his friends ambush them and escape in the van containing the cannabis and the warden. They transfer the loot to their own van and return home, knocking out the warden and dumping him by the road before arranging for Nick to fence the drugs to violent gangster Rory Breaker. Rory agrees to buy the cannabis at half price but two of his men visit the house of the growers, discover that they have been robbed and the cannabis he just bought has been stolen from his own growers. Rory threatens Nick into giving him Eddies address and tasks one of the two surviving growers, Winston, to identify the robbers. While the friends celebrate at JDs bar, Dogs crew, having accidentally discovered that they were robbed by their neighbours, set up an ambush in Eddies flat. Rory and his gang arrive at the flat instead and in the ensuing shoot-out, all except Dog and Winston are killed. Winston leaves with the drugs. Dog attempts to escape with the shotguns and the cash but Big Chris arrives, incapacitates him, and takes both. Attempting to recover the guns, Gary and Dean follow Chris, oblivious to the fact that Chris is bringing them to Harry. Having delivered the money and guns to Harry, Chris returns to his car to find Dog holding his son Little Chris at knifepoint, demanding the cash be returned to him. Chris complies and starts the car. Meanwhile, Gary and Dean burst into Harrys office. The ensuing confrontation results in the deaths of Gary, Dean, Barry and Harry. Having discovered the carnage at their flat and their loot missing, the four friends head to Harrys office, finding a second set of corpses, and decide to take the money for themselves. Chris deliberately crashes into their car to disable Dog and then fatally bludgeons him with his car door. He then retrieves the cash from the unconscious Eddie but allows Tom to leave with the shotguns after a brief stand-off. The friends are arrested but soon released after the warden identifies Dog and his crew as the culprits. Back at the bar, Eddie, Bacon and Soap dispatch Tom to discard the guns, as they are the only remaining evidence linking them to the case. While Tom is away, Chris arrives to announce his intentions of leaving the friends alone, but warns them not to seek him out in the future. Chris then returns the bag, from which he has taken all the cash for himself and his son and which is now empty save for a catalogue of antique weapons. Leafing through the catalogue, the three friends learn that the shotguns are actually far more valuable than they had realised and frantically call Tom to dissuade him from disposing of them. The film ends with Tom leaning over Southwark Bridge, holding his mobile phone ringing in his mouth, as he prepares to drop the guns into the River Thames.",

            "plot": "In 1880, in Big Whiskey, Wyoming, a cowboy named Quick Mike slashes prostitute Delilah Fitzgeralds face with a knife, permanently disfiguring her after she laughs at his small penis. As punishment, sheriff Little Bill Daggett orders Mike and his associate who was with him at the brothel, Davey Bunting, to turn over several of their horses to Delilahs employer, Skinny DuBois, for his loss of revenue. Outraged, the prostitutes offer a 1,000 bounty for the cowboys deaths.In Hodgeman County, Kansas, a boastful young man visits Will Munnys hog farm. He calls himself the Schofield Kid and claims to be an experienced bounty hunter looking for help pursuing the cowboys. Formerly a notorious outlaw and murderer, Will is now a repentant widower raising two children. After initially refusing to help, Will realizes that his farm is failing and his childrens future is in jeopardy. He recruits his friend Ned Logan, another retired outlaw, and they catch up with the Kid, who, they discover, is severely near-sighted.Back in Big Whiskey, British-born gunfighter English Bob, an old acquaintance and rival of Little Bill, seeks the bounty. He arrives in town with his biographer W. W. Beauchamp, who naively believes Bobs tall tales. Enforcing the towns anti-gun law, Little Bill, with his deputies, disarms Bob and beats him savagely to discourage others from attempting to claim the bounty. Bob, humiliated, is banished from town the next morning, but Beauchamp stays out of a fascination with the Sheriff, who debunks many of the romantic notions Beauchamp has about the Wild West. Little Bill explains to Beauchamp that the best attribute for a gunslinger is to be cool-headed under fire rather than to have the quickest draw, and to always kill the best shooter first.Will, Ned, and the Kid arrive in town during a rainstorm and enter Skinnys saloon. While Ned and the Kid meet with the prostitutes upstairs, Little Bill confronts a feverish Will. Not realizing Wills identity but correctly guessing that he wants the bounty, Bill confiscates his pistol and beats him. Ned and the Kid escape through a back window and take Will to an unoccupied barn outside of town, where they and the prostitutes nurse him back to health. A few days later, the trio ambush Davey. After missing Davey and shooting his horse, Ned falters and Will shoots Davey instead. Ned decides to quit and return to Kansas.Ned is later captured and flogged to death by Little Bill to learn the whereabouts of Will and the Kid. Will takes the Kid with him to the cowboys ranch, directing him to ambush Quick Mike in the outhouse and shoot him. After they escape, a distraught Kid drunkenly confesses he had never killed anyone before and is overcome with remorse. A prostitute arrives with the reward and tells them about Neds fate. Shocked by the news, Will begins drinking and demands the Kids revolver. The Kid hands it over, saying that he no longer wants to be a killer, and Will sends him back to Kansas to distribute the reward.That night, Will finds Neds corpse displayed in a coffin outside Skinnys saloon. Inside, Little Bill and his deputies are organizing a posse. Will walks in alone, brandishing a shotgun, and kills Skinny for displaying Neds corpse. He then aims at Little Bill, but the shotgun misfires. In the ensuing gunfight, Will shoots Little Bill and several other men with the revolver. He then orders the rest of the posse out. Beauchamp lingers briefly to ask how Will survived. Will replies that it was luck and scares him away. Little Bill tries and fails to take another shot while lying on the floor, then bemoans his fate and curses Will, who shoots him dead. Will shouts threats as he mounts his horse and rides out of town.A closing title card states that Wills mother-in-law found his farm abandoned years later, Will having possibly moved to San Francisco with the children, and she remained at a loss to understand why her daughter married such a notorious outlaw and murderer.",

            "plot": "In 1912, Boy Scout Indiana Jones lives with his father Henry Jones Sr. in Moab, Utah. One day, while undergoing a cave exploration, Indy takes a crucifix owned by Coronado from a group of graverobbers led by a man named Garth, and after a brief horse chase, flees to his home, where Garth and his men find him and retrieve the crucifix. Garth, however, admits his respect towards Indiana and gives him his fedora before leaving.In 1938, Indy successfully takes back the crucifix from the employer of the graverobbers off the Portuguese coast. After returning to the United States, Indy learns Henry has disappeared while searching for the Holy Grail. Walter Donovan, his father\u2019s financial backer, tasks Indy with finding both Henry and the Grail. Indy receives a package containing Henry\u2019s diary, which includes his research on the Grail, and travels to Venice alongside Marcus Brody to meet Henry\u2019s associate Elsa Schneider. Beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indy and Elsa discover a catacomb containing an inscribed shield which reveals that the path to the Grail begins in Alexandretta. The two are subsequently attacked by a mysterious group who reveal themselves to be the secret Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, dedicated to protecting the Grail. After saving the group\u2019s leader Kazim, Indy learns that Henry is being held at a castle in Austria. Indy entrusts Marcus with a map from the diary detailing a route to the Grail and sends him to Alexandretta to rendezvous with their old friend Sallah. Discovering their rooms have been ransacked, Indy reveals the diary\u2019s existence to Elsa before they sleep together.In Austria, Indy and Elsa infiltrate the castle, discovering it to be under Nazi control. Indy finds Henry and tries to escape, but surrenders after Elsa is held captive by the Nazis. She reveals herself to be a Nazi collaborator and takes the diary, and Indy and Henry are tied up and learn that Donovan is also working with the Nazis. After arriving in Alexandretta, Marcus is captured by the Nazis as well. Elsa returns to Germany, while Indy and Henry escape the castle before traveling to Berlin to retrieve the diary. After recovering it from Elsa, Indy and Henry flee on a zeppelin before evading two Luftwaffe planes pursuing them.Once Indy and Henry arrive in Hatay, Sallah informs them that the Nazis have also traveled there using the map. While they are following the trail, the Nazis are attacked by the Brotherhood but defeat them. Henry takes advantage of the distraction to try to rescue Marcus but is captured; Indy attacks the Nazi convoy in response and is eventually able to destroy it with help from Henry and Marcus. Indy, Henry, Marcus and Sallah proceed to a temple containing the Grail, where they observe the Nazis attempting to overcome the temple\u2019s traps before being captured. Donovan forces Indy to find safe passage for them by mortally wounding Henry; a drink from the Grail can heal him. With the help of the diary, Indy overcomes the traps and finds a room with many cups and an ancient knight, who explains that only one cup is the true Grail. Donovan and Elsa enter the room, and Elsa deliberately gives him the wrong cup, killing Donovan after he drinks from it. Indy identifies the true Grail and rescues Henry. Elsa falls to her death when her attempt to leave with the Grail causes the temple to collapse, and Indy nearly suffers the same fate before Henry saves him. The Grail falls into an abyss as Indy and his companions escape and ride off into the sunset.",

            "plot": "On Christmas Eve, NYPD Detective John McClane arrives in Los Angeles, hoping to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly, at a party held by her employer, the Nakatomi Corporation. He is driven to Nakatomi Plaza by a limo driver, Argyle, who offers to wait for McClane in the garage. While McClane washes himself, the tower is seized by the German radical Hans Gruber and his heavily armed team, including Karl and Theo. Everyone in the tower is taken hostage except for McClane, who slips away, and Argyle, who remains oblivious to events. Gruber is posing as a terrorist to steal the 640 million in untraceable bearer bonds in the building\\'s vault. He kills executive Joseph Takagi after failing to extract the access code from him and tasks Theo with breaking into the vault. The terrorists are alerted to McClane\\'s presence, and Karl\\'s brother, Tony, is sent after him. McClane kills Tony and takes his weapon and radio, which he uses to contact the skeptical LAPD. Sergeant Al Powell is sent to investigate. Meanwhile, McClane kills more terrorists and recovers their bag of C-4 and detonators. Realizing Powell is about to leave, having found nothing amiss, McClane drops a terrorist\\'s corpse onto his car. After Powell calls for backup, a SWAT team attempts to storm the building but is counterattacked by the terrorists. McClane throws some C-4 down an elevator shaft, causing an explosion that kills some of the terrorists and ends the counterattack. Holly\\'s co-worker Harry Ellis attempts to negotiate on Gruber\\'s behalf but is killed by Gruber when McClane refuses to surrender. While checking the explosives on the roof, Gruber encounters McClane and pretends to be an escaped hostage; McClane gives Gruber a gun. Gruber attempts to shoot McClane but finds the weapon is unloaded, and he is saved only by the intervention of other terrorists. McClane escapes but is injured by shattered glass and loses the detonators. Outside, FBI agents take control. They order the power to be shut off, which, as Gruber had anticipated, disables the final vault lock so his team can collect the bonds. The FBI agrees to Gruber\\'s demand for a helicopter, intending to send helicopter gunships to eliminate the group. McClane realizes Gruber plans to blow the roof to kill the hostages and fake his team\\'s deaths. Karl, enraged by Tony\\'s death, attacks McClane and is seemingly killed. Gruber sees a news report by Richard Thornburg on McClane\\'s children and deduces that he is Holly\\'s husband. The hostages are taken to the roof while Gruber keeps Holly with him. McClane drives the hostages from the roof just before Gruber detonates it and destroys the approaching FBI helicopters. Meanwhile, Theo retrieves an escape vehicle from the parking garage but is knocked out by Argyle, who has been following events on the limo\\'s CB radio. A weary and battered McClane finds Holly with Gruber and his remaining henchman. McClane surrenders to Gruber and is about to be shot but grabs his concealed service pistol taped to his back and uses his last two bullets to wound Gruber and kill his accomplice. Gruber crashes through a window but grabs onto Holly\\'s wristwatch and makes a last-ditch attempt to kill the pair. McClane unclasps the watch, and Gruber falls to his death. Outside, Karl ambushes McClane and Holly but is shot dead by Powell. Holly punches Thornburg when he attempts to interview McClane. Argyle crashes through the parking garage door in the limo and drives McClane and Holly away together.",

            "plot": "In 1941, Jake LaMotta is a young, up-and-coming middleweight boxer who suffers his first loss to Jimmy Reeves after a controversial decision. Jakes brother Joey discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts, but he repeatedly refuses the Mafis help, wanting to win the championship on his own terms. Some time after, Jake spots a fifteen-year-old girl named Vickie at a swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, although he is already married and Vickie is underage. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite Jake dominating Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson, who Joey feels won only because he was enlisting into the Army the following week. By 1945, Jake marries Vickie.Jake is controlling and domineering over Vickie, and constantly worries that she has feelings for other men. His jealousy is evident when he brutally beats his next opponent, Tony Janiro, in front of Tommy Como, the local mob boss, and Vickie. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vickie, who implies she is dissatisfied in her marriage with Jake. Under the wrong impression that Vickie is having an affair with Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. Jake purposely loses his next match against Billy Fox, and is booed out of the building after putting up a lackluster performance. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, much to his anguish. He is eventually reinstated, and in 1949, wins the middleweight championship title against Marcel Cerdan.A year later, Jake becomes increasingly paranoid that Vickie is having an affair. He asks Joey if he has had an affair with her, enraging Joey and causing him to leave. Jake later presses Vickie about whether she has had an affair, leading to her sarcastically confessing that she had sex with Joey, Salvy and Tommy. In a fit of rage, Jake, followed by Vickie, walks to Joys house and assaults him in front of his wife Lenora and their children before knocking Vickie unconscious. Vickie later returns to their home and threatens to leave, but they reconcile. After defending his championship belt in a grueling fifteen-round bout against Laurent Dauthuille in 1950, he calls his brother after the fight to make amends, but when Joey assumes Salvy is on the other end and starts insulting and cursing at him, Jake silently hangs up. Estranged from his brother, Jake sees his career decline and he eventually loses his title to Sugar Ray Robinson in their final encounter in 1951.By 1956, an aged and overweight Jake has retired and moved with his family to Miami. After he stays out all night at the nightclub which he owns, Vickie tells him she wants a divorce as well as full custody of their children. She also threatens to call the police if he comes anywhere near them. He is later arrested for introducing under-age girls to men in his club. He unsuccessfully attempts to bribe his way out of his criminal case using the jewels from his championship belt. In 1957, he goes to jail, sorrowfully questioning his misfortune and crying in despair. Upon returning to New York City in 1958, he encounters Joey, who reluctantly accepts his embrace.In 1964, Jake performs stand-up comedy at various clubs. Backstage before a show LaMotta prepares himself for his performance by shadowboxing, quoting scenes from On the Waterfront and chanting Im the boss before taking the stage.",

Along the way, Arthur debates whether swallows could carry coconuts, passes through a town infected with the plague, recounts receiving Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake to two anarcho-syndicalist peasants, defeats the Black Knight, and observes an impromptu witch trial. He recruits Sir Bedevere the Wise, Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Galahad the Pure, Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, and the aptly named Sir Not-Appearing-in-this-Film, along with their squires and Robins minstrels. Arthur leads the knights to Camelot, but, after a musical number, changes his mind, deeming it a silly place. As they turn away, God appears and orders Arthur to find the Holy Grail.Arthur and his knights arrive at a castle occupied by French soldiers, who claim to have the Grail and taunt the Britons, driving them back with a barrage of barnyard animals. Bedevere concocts a plan to sneak in using a Trojan Rabbit, but forgets to tell the others to hide inside it; the Knights are forced to flee when it is flung back at them. Arthur decides the knights should go their separate ways to search for the Grail. Meanwhile, a modern-day historian filming a documentary on the Arthurian legends is killed by an unknown knight on horseback, triggering a police investigation.Arthur and Bedevere are given directions by an old man and attempt to satisfy the strange requests of the dreaded Knights Who Say Ni Sir Robin avoids a fight with a Three-Headed Knight by running away while the heads are arguing amongst themselves. Sir Galahad is led by a grail-shaped beacon to Castle Anthrax, which is occupied exclusively by young women, who wish to be punished for misleading him, but is rescued against his will by Lancelot. Lancelot receives an arrow-shot note from Swamp Castle. Believing the note is from a lady being forced to marry against her will, he storms the castle and slaughters several members of the wedding party, only to discover the note is from an effeminate prince.Arthur and his knights regroup and are joined by Brother Maynard, his monk brethren, and three new knights: Bors, Gawain and Ector. They meet Tim the Enchanter, who directs them to a cave where the location of the Grail is said to be written. The entrance to the cave is guarded by the Rabbit of Caerbannog. Underestimating it, the knights attack, but the Rabbit easily kills Bors, Gawain and Ector. Arthur uses the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, provided by Brother Maynard, to destroy the creature. Inside the cave, they find an inscription from Joseph of Arimathea, directing them to Castle Aarrgh and warning them of the Legendary Black Beast, a cave monster whose location of origin is obscured by a screaming sound. In an animated sequence, the Black Beast devours Brother Maynard, but Arthur and the knights escape after the animator unexpectedly suffers a fatal heart attack.The knights approach the Bridge of Death, where the bridge-keeper demands they answer three questions in order to pass or else be cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril. Lancelot easily answers simple questions and crosses. An overly cocky Robin is defeated by an unexpectedly difficult question, and an indecisive Galahad fails an easy one; both are magically flung into the gorge. When Arthur asks for clarification on a question regarding the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow, the bridge-keeper cannot answer and is himself thrown into the gorge.Arthur and Bedevere cannot find Lancelot, unaware that he has been arrested by police investigating the historians death. The pair reach Castle Aarrgh, but find it occupied by the French soldiers from earlier in the film. After being repelled by showers of manure, they summon an army of knights and prepare to assault the castle. As the army charges, the police arrive, arrest Arthur and Bedevere on suspicion of the murder of the historian, and break the camera, abruptly ending the film.",

            "plot": "Judgment at Nuremberg centers on a military tribunal convened in Nuremberg, Germany, in which four German judges and prosecutors stand accused of crimes against humanity for their involvement in atrocities committed under the Nazi regime. Judge Dan Haywood is the chief judge of a three-judge panel of Allied jurists who will hear and decide the case against the defendants. Haywood is particularly interested in learning how the defendant Ernst Janning, a respected jurist and legal scholar, could have committed the atrocities he is accused of, including sentencing innocent people to death. Haywood seeks to understand how the German people could have been deaf and blind to the Nazi regimes crimes. In doing so, he befriends the widow of a German general who had been executed by the Allies. He talks with other Germans who have varying perspectives on the war. Other characters the judge meets are US Army Captain Harrison Byers, who is assigned to assist the American judges hearing the case, and Irene Hoffmann, who is afraid to provide testimony that may bolster the prosecutions case against the judges. German defense attorney Hans Rolfe argues that the defendants were not the only ones to aid or ignore the Nazi regime. He claims the United States has committed acts just as bad or worse than the Nazis. Meanwhile, as a strict constructionist jurist, Janning refuses to testify or participate in a legal proceeding that he profoundly feels is no better than a post-WWII Western kangaroo court of its own. As the proceeding becomes more and more intolerable to him, he dramatically breaks his silence. He chooses to testify before the Tribunal as a witness for the prosecution, admitting he is guilty of condemning to death a Jewish man of blood defilement charges \u2014 namely, that the man had sex with a 16-year-old Gentile girl \u2014 when he knew there was no evidence to support such a verdict. Janning explains that well-meaning people such as him helped Adolf Hitlers antisemitic, racist policies out of patriotism despite knowing it was wrong, and that all of Germany bears some measure of responsibility for the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. Haywood must weigh considerations of geopolitical expediency against his own ideals of justice. The trial is set against the background of the Berlin Blockade, and there is pressure to let the German defendants off lightly to gain German support in the growing Cold War against the Soviet Union. While the four defendants maintain their pleas of not guilty in their closing statements, Janning and fellow defendant, Werner Lampe, show clear remorse for their actions, while a third, Friedrich Hofstetter, claims they had no choice but to execute the laws handed down by Hitlers government. Only the fourth defendant, Emil Hahn, remains unrepentant, telling the Americans that they will live to regret not allying with the Nazis against the Soviet Union. Ultimately, all four defendants are found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. Haywood visits Janning in his cell. Janning affirms to Haywood that his verdict was a just one, but asks him to believe that, regarding the mass murder of innocents, he never knew that it would come to that. Judge Haywood replies it came to that the first time Janning condemned a man he knew to be innocent. Haywood departs; a title card informs the audience that, of 99 defendants sentenced to prison terms in Nuremberg trials that took place in the American Zone, none was still serving a sentence when the film was released in 1961.",

            "plot": "In Prohibition-era Chicago, Joe is a jazz saxophone player and an irresponsible, impulsive ladies man; his anxious friend Jerry is a jazz double bass player. They work in a speakeasy owned by local Mafia boss Spats Colombo. Tipped off by informant Toothpick Charlie, the police raid the joint. Joe and Jerry escape, but later witness Spats and his henchmen gunning down Toothpick and his gang in revenge an incident inspired by the Saint Valentines Day Massacre. Spats and his gang see them as they flee. Broke, terrified, and desperate to leave Chicago, Joe and Jerry disguise themselves as women named Josephine and Daphne so they can join Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators, an all-female band headed to Miami. On the train, Joe and Jerry befriend Sugar Kane, the bands vocalist and ukulele player. Joe and Jerry become obsessed with Sugar and compete for her affection while maintaining their disguises. Sugar confides to Josephine that she has sworn off male saxophone players, who have taken advantage of her in the past. She hopes to find a gentle, bespectacled millionaire in Florida. Josephine and Daphne become close friends with Sugar during a late-night party on the train and struggle to remember that flirting with her would compromise their cover. Once in Miami, Joe woos Sugar by affecting a Mid-Atlantic accent and posing as oil heir Shell Oil Junior while feigning indifference to her. An actual millionaire, the much-married, aging Osgood Fielding III, persistently pursues Daphne, whose refusals only increase his appetite. He invites her to dinner on his yacht. Joe convinces Jerry to keep Osgood occupied onshore so that Junior can take Sugar to Osgoods yacht and pass it off as his own. On the yacht, Junior tells Sugar that psychological trauma from the death of a former lover has left him impotent, but that he would marry anyone who could cure him. Sugar tries to arouse him, with considerable success. Meanwhile, Daphne and Osgood dance the tango La Cumparsita until dawn. When Joe and Jerry get back to the hotel, Jerry announces that Osgood has proposed marriage to Daphne and that he has accepted, anticipating a divorce and cash settlement when his ruse is revealed. Joe convinces Jerry that he cannot marry Osgood. The hotel hosts a conference for the Friends of Italian Opera Society, a front for a national Mafia meeting presided over by Little Bonaparte. Spats and his gang recognize Joe and Jerry as the witnesses they have been looking for. Fearing for their lives, Joe and Jerry realize they must quit the band and leave the hotel. Joe conceals his deception from Sugar by telling her over the telephone that Junior must marry a woman of his fathers choosing and move to Venezuela. Sugar becomes distressed and heartbroken. Joe and Jerry evade Spats men by hiding under a table at the syndicate banquet, where Little Bonaparte roasts Spats and has him and his men killed. Joe and Jerry flee through the hotel after being spotted. Joe, dressed as Josephine, sees Sugar onstage singing a lament to lost love. He runs onto the platform and kisses her, causing her to realize that Josephine and Junior were the same person. Jerry persuades Osgood to take Daphne and Josephine away on his yacht. Sugar runs from the stage at the end of her performance and jumps aboard Osgoods launch just as it is leaving the dock. Joe confesses the truth to Sugar and tells her that she deserves better, but Sugar wants him anyway, realizing he is the first man to genuinely care for her. Meanwhile, Jerry tries to get out of his engagement by listing reasons why Daphne and Osgood cannot marry, none of which bother Osgood. Exasperated, Jerry rips off his wig and says I am a man in his normal voice; still smiling, Osgood replies Well, nobody is perfect, confounding Jerry and leaving him speechless.",

            "plot": "The story begins in medias res, told via narration by acerbic theatre critic Addison DeWitt, who introduces the various characters as they attend the ceremony for the distinguished Sarah Siddons Award for Prestigious Achievement, awarded to rising star actor Eve Harrington. DeWitt\\'s narration promises the audience will learn Eve\\'s true story as the narrative voice switches to that of Karen Richards.Some years previous, Broadway star Margo Channing, recently turned 40, worries about what advancing age will mean for her career. After a performance of Margo\\'s latest play, Margo\\'s close friend, Karen Richards, wife of the play\\'s author Lloyd Richards, brings besotted fan Eve Harrington backstage to meet Margo. In Margo\\'s dressing room, Eve tells Karen, Lloyd, and Margo\\'s maid Birdie, that she followed Margo\\'s last theatrical tour to New York City after seeing her perform in San Francisco. She tells an engrossing story of growing up poor in Wisconsin and losing her young husband, Eddie, in the South Pacific during World War II. Moved by Eve\\'s story, Margo takes her into her home as her assistant, upsetting Birdie. Eve quickly manipulates her way into Margo\\'s life, acting as both secretary and adoring fan.Adding to Margo\\'s concerns about aging is her romantic relationship with the play\\'s director, Bill Sampson, 8 years her junior. Without telling Margo, Eve places a long-distance phone call \"on Margo\\'s behalf\" to Bill when Margo forgets his birthday. This results in Margo\\'s embarrassment, exposing her to Bill\\'s realizing that Margo forgot his birthday, while Eve remembered and even sent her own greetings. Margo grows increasingly distrustful toward Eve, particularly after catching Eve taking a bow in front of a mirror while pretending to wear Margo\\'s costume. Margo asks producer Max Fabian to hire Eve at his office, but instead, Eve becomes Margo\\'s understudy without Margo\\'s knowledge.As Margo\\'s irritation grows, Karen sympathizes with Eve, believing that Margo is overdramatizing her resentment of Eve out of temperamental peevishness. Hoping to humble Margo, Karen conspires for her to miss a performance so that Eve can perform. Eve invites the city\\'s theater critics to attend the performance \u2013 including the influential DeWitt. Eve\\'s performance is a triumph. Later that night, Eve  attempts to seduce Bill, who as a successful Broadway producer might be useful to her career. Bill  rejects Eve, letting her know that he sees her manipulations. Instead, Addison takes an interest in Eve. He interviews her for a column, harshly criticizing Margo for resisting younger talent.Margo and Bill announce their engagement at dinner with Lloyd and Karen. Eve summons Karen to the ladies\\' room and, after first appearing regretful, delivers an ultimatum: Karen must recommend her to Lloyd to play Cora, the lead role in Lloyd\\'s new play. Otherwise, she will reveal Karen\\'s part in Margo\\'s missed performance. When Karen returns to the table\u2014to her relief\u2014Margo surprisingly announces that she does not wish to play Cora, saying she is too old for the ing\u00e9nue role.Eve is cast as Cora. Just before the new play\\'s premiere in New Haven, Eve reveals her next plan to Addison: to marry Lloyd\u2014who she has seduced despite his wife Karen\\'s championship of her\u2014so that Lloyd can write plays for her to star in. Angered with Eve\\'s audacity, Addison says he knows her backstory is entirely lies; her real name is Gertrude Slescynski, she was never married, and she was paid to leave town over an affair with her married boss. He also says Lloyd would never leave Karen for Eve. Addison then blackmails Eve, saying she now \"belongs\" to him.The story catches up to the opening scene; months later, Eve is a Broadway star headed for Hollywood. While accepting the Sarah Siddons Award, she thanks Margo, Bill, Lloyd, and Karen as all four coldly stare back. Eve skips the after-party and returns home, where she encounters Phoebe, a teenage fan who slipped into her apartment and fell asleep. Phoebe professes her adoration and ingratiates herself with Eve, then begins packing her trunk. Eve invites her to stay over rather than take the long subway ride back to Brooklyn. While Eve is resting, Addison brings Eve\\'s forgotten award to the door and is greeted by Phoebe, who admits she chose her own theatrical name. Addison realizes Phoebe will do to Eve what Eve did to Margo. When she is alone, Phoebe puts on Eve\\'s elegant cloak and poses in front of a floor-length mirror, holding the award and bowing.",

            "plot": "During the Klondike Gold Rush, in Alaska, gold prospector Big Jim finds an enormous gold deposit on his parcel of land when a blizzard strikes. The Lone Prospector gets lost in the same blizzard while also prospecting for gold. He stumbles into the cabin of Black Larsen, a wanted criminal. Larsen tries to throw the Prospector out when Jim also stumbles inside. Larsen tries to scare both out using his shotgun but is overpowered by Jim, and the three agree to a truce allowing them all to stay in the cabin. When the storm is taking so long that food is running out, the three draw lots for who will have to go out into the blizzard to obtain food. Larsen loses and leaves the cabin. While outside looking for food, he encounters Jims gold deposit and decides to ambush him there when Jim returns. Meanwhile, the two remaining in the cabin get so desperate that they cook and eat one of the Prospectors shoes. Later, Jim gets delirious, imagines the Prospector as a giant chicken and attacks him. A bear then enters the cabin and is killed, supplying them with food. After the storm subsides, both leave the cabin, the Prospector continuing on to the next gold boom town while Jim returns to his gold deposit. There, he is knocked out by Larsen with a shovel. While fleeing with some of the mined gold, Larsen dies in an avalanche. Jim recovers consciousness and wanders into the snow, having lost his memory from the blow. When he returns to the town, his memory has been partly restored and he remembers that he found a large gold deposit, that it was close to a cabin, and that he stayed there with the Prospector. But he knows neither the location of the deposit nor of the cabin, and so looks for the Prospector, hoping that he can lead him to the cabin. The Prospector arrives at the town and encounters Georgia, a dance hall girl, and falls in love with her. To irritate Jack, a man who is making aggressive advances toward Georgia and is pestering her for a dance, she instead decides to dance with the most deplorable looking tramp in the dance hall, the Prospector. After encountering each other again, she accepts his invitation for a New Years Eve dinner, but does not take it seriously and forgets about it. On New Years Eve, while waiting for her to arrive to the dinner, the Prospector imagines entertaining her with a dance of bread rolls on forks. When she does not arrive until midnight, he walks alone through the streets, desperate. Meanwhile, Georgia remembers his invitation and decides to visit him. Finding his home empty but seeing the meticulously prepared dinner and a present for her, she has a change of heart and prepares a note asking to talk to him. When the Prospector is handed the note, he goes searching for Georgia. Jim finds him and drags him away to go search for the cabin, giving the Prospector only enough time to tell Georgia that he will return to her as a millionaire. Jim and the Prospector find the cabin and stay for the night. Overnight, another blizzard blows the cabin half over a cliff right next to Jims gold deposit. The next morning the cabin is rocking dangerously over the cliff edge while the two try to escape. Jim eventually gets out and pulls the Prospector to safety right when the cabin falls off the cliff. One year later, both have become wealthy, but the Prospector never could find Georgia. They return to the contiguous United States on a ship on which, unknown to them, Georgia is also traveling. When the Prospector agrees to don his old clothes for a photograph, he falls down the stairs, encountering Georgia once more. After she mistakenly thinks he is a stowaway and tries to save him from the ships crew, the misunderstanding is cleared up and both are happily reunited.",

He is in love with The Girl but  has a rival, The Local Sheik. Neither has much money. He finds a dollar note in the garbage he swept up in the lobby. He takes it and adds it to the 2 he has. A woman comes and says that she lost a dollar. He gives it back. But then a sad old woman also says that she lost a dollar, so he gives that also, leaving himself with 1. A man comes and searches the garbage and finds a wallet full of money. Projectionist buys a 1 box of chocolates, all he can afford, and changes the price to 4 before giving it to the woman he loves at her house. He later gives her a ring. The Sheik comes into the house and steals the pocket watch of the Girls Father and pawns it for 4. With the money, he buys a 3 box of chocolates for the Girl. When the Father notices that his watch is missing, the Sheik slips the pawn ticket into the Projectionists pocket unnoticed. The Projectionist offers to solve the crime, but when the pawn ticket is found in his pocket, he is banished from the house. When the Sheik leaves, the Projectionist shadows his every movement. The Sheik loses him by shutting him in a train car. Later, the Girl takes the pawn ticket to the pawnbroker and asks him to describe who pawned it. He points to the Sheik, standing outside. While showing a film advertised in the lobby as Hearts and Pearls about the theft of a pearl necklace, the Projectionist falls asleep and dreams that he enters the movie as a detective, Sherlock Jr. The other actors are replaced by the Projectionists acquaintances, with the Sheik taking the role of the Villain. The dream begins with the theft being committed by the Villain with the aid of the Butler. The Girls Father calls for the worlds greatest detective and Sherlock Jr. arrives. Fearing that they will be caught, the Villain and the Butler attempt to kill Sherlock Jr. through several traps, poison, and an elaborate pool game with an exploding 13 ball. When these fail, the Villain and Butler try to escape. Sherlock Jr. tracks them down to a warehouse but is outnumbered by the gang to which the villain was selling the necklace. During the confrontation, Sherlock Jr. discovers that they have kidnapped the Girl. With the help of his assistant, Gillette, Sherlock Jr. manages to save the woman, and after a car chase, manages to defeat the gang. When he awakens, the Girl shows up to tell him that she and her father learned the identity of the real thief after she went to the pawn shop to see who actually pawned the pocket watch. As a reconciliation scene happens to be playing on the screen, the Projectionist mimics the actors romantic behavior.",

            "plot": "In a cemetery in the former nation of Zubrowka, a woman visits the shrine of a renowned writer, known simply as Author, reading his most-cherished book: The Grand Budapest Hotel. The book, written in 1985, recounts the 1968 vacation of the young writer at the once-grand, then-drab hotel. There, he meets its owner, Zero Moustafa, who tells his rags to riches story at dinner.In 1932, Zero is an illegal refugee escaping a war waged by a fascist regime, which killed his entire family. He is hired as a lobby boy supervised by Monsieur Gustave H., the hotels concierge. Gustave strikes up affairs with old, wealthy clients, including dowager Madame C\u00e9line Villeneuve Desgoffe-und-Taxis known as Madame D., with whom hes had a nearly two-decade affair. She mysteriously dies a month after her last hotel visit so Gustave and Zero visit her estate, where relatives come for the reading of her will. There, her attorney, Deputy Vilmos Kovacs, announces a recent codicil which bequeaths the famous Renaissance painting Boy with Apple to Gustave. Madame Ds son and an agent of the regime, Dmitri, refuses to let it happen. Gustave and Zero abscond with the painting, hiding it in a safe in the Grand Budapest.After a testimony by Madame Ds butler Serge X, Gustave is arrested by Inspector Alfred J. Henckels for Madame Ds murder; Serge then goes into hiding. Gustave befriends a gang during his imprisonment and provides them with pastries from Mendls, a well-known bakery. After extensive research of the prison, one of Gustaves cellmates, Ludwig, tells the gang that they can escape via a storm-drain sewage system. Convinced to join the prison break, Gustave has Zero place hammers, chisels, and sawblades inside pastries made by Agatha, an apprentice of Herr Mendl and Zeros fianc\u00e9e. The guard responsible for checking contraband cannot bring himself to break open the pastries since Mendls pastries are works of art. During the prison break, the group of convicts runs into guards who secretly gamble at night, and convict Gunther is forced to sacrifice himself to dispatch the guards. The rest of the group manages to escape and disperse. Meanwhile, Dmitri sends his hitman, J. G. Jopling, to kill Kovacs after questioning his loyalty, as well as Serges sister for hiding his whereabouts.When Zero and Gustave are reunited, they set out to prove Gustaves innocence with the assistance of a fraternity of concierges known as the Society of the Crossed Keys, which locates Serge and facilitates a meeting between him, Gustave and Zero. Serge reveals that he was pressured to implicate Gustave by the real killer, Dmitri, and that Madame D. had a missing second will, which would only take effect should she be murdered. Jopling arrives and kills Serge, leaving Gustave and Zero without a witness, then tries to flee. After a chase through the snow, Gustave is left dangling off a cliff at the mercy of Jopling. Before it is too late, Zero rescues Gustave by pushing Jopling off the cliff, and the two men continue their escape from swarming Zubrowkan troops led by Henckels.Gustave, Zero, and Agatha return to the Grand Budapest to find it converted into a fascist headquarters by Dmitri. Agatha sneaks in to retrieve the painting but is spotted by Dmitri. Gustave and Zero rush in to save Agatha, but Dmitri shoots at them and initiates a melee with Zubrowkan troops, which Henckels stops. On the back of the painting, the group finds Madame Ds second will, which reveals her as the Grand Budapest owner and bequeaths it to Gustave. He is exonerated in court, while Dmitri becomes the main suspect and flees the country. Over time, Gustave becomes one of the wealthiest Zubrowkans, and Zero and Agatha are wed. However, while the three are later traveling by train, soldiers come by and destroy Zeros refugee documents; Gustave tries to fend them off but is killed. His own will bequeaths the hotel and his fortune to Zero. He maintains the Grand Budapest up to its eventual decline in memory of Agatha who, like their infant son, died from Prussian Grippe.",

            "plot": "In 1929 Lynchburg, Virginia, young Desmond Doss nearly kills his brother while roughhousing. That event and his Seventh-day Adventist upbringing reinforce Desmonds belief in the commandment Thou shalt not kill. Years later, he takes an injured man to the hospital and meets a nurse, Dorothy Schutte. They strike a romance, and Desmond tells her of his interest in medical work. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brings the United States into World War II, Desmond enlists in the United States Army to serve as a combat medic. His father, Tom, a PTSD-ridden World War I veteran, is deeply upset by the decision. Shortly before leaving, Desmond and Dorothy get engaged. Desmond is placed in basic training with the 77th Infantry Division under the command of Sergeant Howell. He excels physically but becomes a pariah among some of his fellow soldiers for refusing to handle a rifle and train on Saturdays. Howell and Captain Glover attempt to discharge Desmond for psychiatric reasons under Section 8, but are overruled, as Desmonds religious beliefs do not constitute mental illness. They subsequently torment Desmond by putting him through grueling labor, intending to drive him out. Despite being beaten one night by his fellow soldiers, he refuses to identify his attackers. Desmonds unit completes basic training and is released on leave during which Desmond intends to marry Dorothy, but his refusal to carry a firearm leads to an arrest for insubordination. Captain Glover and Dorothy visit Desmond in jail and try to convince him to plead guilty so that he can be released without charge, but he refuses to compromise his beliefs. At his court-martial, Desmond pleads not guilty, but before he is sentenced, his father bursts into the tribunal with a letter from his former commanding officer, now a brigadier general, stating that his sons pacifism is protected by the US Constitution. The charges against Desmond are dropped, and he and Dorothy are married. Desmonds unit is deployed to the Pacific Theater. During the Battle of Okinawa, they are tasked with ascending and securing the Maeda Escarpment Hacksaw Ridge. During the initial fight, with heavy losses on both sides, Desmond saves the life of his squad-mate Smitty, earning his respect. Smitty apologizes for doubting his courage, and Desmond reveals to him that his aversion to holding a firearm stems from nearly shooting his drunken father, who threatened his mother with a gun. The next morning, the Japanese launch a massive counterattack and drive the Americans off the escarpment. Smitty is killed, and Howell and several of Desmonds comrades are left injured on the battlefield. Desmond hears the cries of dying soldiers so returns to save them, carrying the wounded, and Smittys body, to the cliffs edge and belaying them down by rope, each time praying to save one more. The arrival of dozens of wounded who had been presumed dead comes as a shock to the rest of the unit below. When day breaks, Desmond rescues Howell, and both escape Hacksaw under enemy fire. Captain Glover apologizes for dismissing Desmonds beliefs and states that they are scheduled to retake the ridge on Saturday but will not launch the next attack without him. Desmond agrees, but the operation is delayed until after he concludes his Sabbath prayers. With reinforcements, they turn the tide of battle. In an ambush set by Japanese soldiers who pretend to surrender, Desmond manages to save Glover and others by deflecting enemy grenades. He is wounded by a grenade blast, but the battle is won. Desmond is lowered from the cliff, clutching the Bible that Dorothy had given to him. The film switches to real photos and footage showing that Desmond was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman for rescuing 75 soldiers at Hacksaw Ridge, as well as real-life footage of Desmond just before his death, recounting his experiences during the war.",

            "plot": "Murphy, also known as Barfi, is an optimistic, street-smart, charming young man who was born deaf and mute to a couple in Darjeeling. His mother died after giving birth to him and his father, Jungbahadur raised him alone while working as a chauffeur. Barfi is known as a troublemaker; he cuts lampposts, plays practical jokes, and is chased by Inspector Sudhanshu Dutta, a local police officer. Barfi meets Shruti Ghosh, a gorgeous, educated young girl who has just arrived in Darjeeling. She is engaged to Ranjeet Sengupta and is due to get married in three months, but Barfi is immediately smitten with Shruti. She also falls in love with Barfi, but Shruti\\'s mother dissuades her from pursuing him because he could not take care of her with his disabilities and lack of money. Shruti unwillingly takes her mother\\'s advice, marries Ranjeet, and leaves town, cutting off all contact with Barfi. Meanwhile, Barfi\\'s father suffers from kidney failure and Barfi is compelled to somehow raise the amount of Indian rupee7000 for his surgery. After an unsuccessful attempt to rob a local bank, Barfi contemplates the kidnapping of Jhilmil Chatterjee, his autistic childhood friend and wealthy heiress of her grandfather\\'s fortune, for a ransom. Upon arriving, Barfi discovers that Jhilmil has already been kidnapped and her father, Durjoy Chatterjee, files a police report and arranges a ransom of 50,000 as demanded. Barfi is escaping from Inspector Dutta from the bank robbery case and spots Jhilmil in a van. He sneaks inside and drives Jhilmil away from the ransom delivery. Barfi proceeds to hide her in his apartment with the police in pursuit. Barfi writes a new ransom note for 7000 and collects the amount from Jhilmil\\'s father, but finds that his father has died just as he makes the hospital payment. Dejected, Barfi tries to leave Jhilmil at the village of her caretaker, but she refuses to leave him and the two soon move to Kolkata, where Barfi assumes responsibility for Jhilmil and takes care of her. Six years later, Barfi and Shruti reunite by chance in Kolkata. Shruti is unhappy with her marriage with Ranjeet, and rekindles her friendship with Barfi, much to the chagrin of the lovestruck Jhilmil, who then goes missing in the city. Shruti files a missing person report for Jhilmil. Inspector Dutta and the Darjeeling police learn about the report, resume their pursuit of Barfi and arrest him. Shruti strives hard to help Barfi and Ranjeet abandons her as a result. As he is being interrogated, another ransom demand for Jhilmil is made and she is apparently killed in the process of the exchange, though her cadaver is never recovered. Inspector Dutta is confused that how come Jhilmil\\'s father received a ransom note for her in Darjeeling when she was living in Kolkata for last six years. In order to conclude the case, the police decide to frame Barfi for Jhilmil\\'s murder, but Inspector Dutta, who grew fond of Barfi after investigating him for his nuisances, asks Shruti to take him away, offering him a second chance at life. She agrees and hopes that now Jhilmil is dead, she can finally be with Barfi. However, Barfi is deeply affected by Jhilmil\\'s loss and finds living with Shruti unfulfilled. He eventually finds the location of Jhilmil\\'s childhood home from the scribbles that she made in their house. Barfi takes Shruti to the place to find Jhilmil, and in a plot twist, the two discover that Jhilmil is alive all along, and that both the kidnappings were fabricated by her father so that he could embezzle money from Jhilmil\\'s trust fund. In the second attempt, the second time, Jhilmil\\'s caretakers from her childhood foster home colluded with Jhilmil\\'s father and faked her death so that she could return to her special-care home, away from her alcoholic mother. In return, Jhilmil\\'s father received control of the trust fund that Jhilmil\\'s late grandfather had left behind for her. Barfi happily reunites with Jhilmil and the two get married, while Shruti spends the rest of her days alone, regretting the loss of her chance to be with Barfi, but still happy about Barfi and Jhilmil reuniting. On the present day, Barfi is gravely ill in a hospital and is close to death. Jhilmil arrives and lies with Barfi in his hospital bed as Shruti narrates that the two died peacefully together, not wanting to leave each other behind in life or death. The film closes showing the last days of Barfi and Jhilmil as credits roll.",

            "plot": "In 1963, Ford Motor Company Vice President Lee Iacocca proposes to Henry Ford II to boost their car sales by purchasing Ferrari, dominant in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Owner Enzo Ferrari uses Ford\\'s offer to secure a deal with Fiat that allows him to retain ownership of the firm\\'s racing team, Scuderia Ferrari, and insults Ford and his whole company. This leads Ford into ordering his racing division to build a car to compete against Ferrari at Le Mans, and Iacocca hiring Carroll Shelby InternationalShelby American owner Carroll Shelby, a retired driver who won Le Mans in 1959. Shelby enlists his friend Ken Miles, a hottempered English racing driver and mechanical engineer.Shelby and Miles develop the UKbuilt Ford GT40 Mk I prototype at Los Angeles International Airport. At the launch of the new Ford Mustang, Miles gives a witheringly rude appraisal of it to Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe. Beebe campaigns against sending Miles to the upcoming race at Le Mans as a public relations liability. Shelby reluctantly excludes Miles and sends Phil Hill and Bruce McLaren to Le Mans; none of the Fords finish.When Ford demands why he should not sack Shelby, Shelby explains that despite the GT40\\'s reliability problems, it instilled fear in Enzo Ferrari by reaching 218 mph350.8 kmh, on the Mulsanne Straight before breaking down. He says a race car cannot be designed by committee. Ford tells him to continue the project and report directly to him. During testing of the GT40 Mk II, the recurrent problem of brake fade causes a crash and fire, which Miles survives. The team realizes the rules permit replacing the whole brake assembly during the race.In 1966, Beebe takes over the racing division. When he and Ford arrive to inspect the program, Shelby locks Beebe in his office and gives Ford a ride in the GT40. Shelby makes an agreement with Ford: if Miles wins the 24 Hours of Daytona, then he will race at Le Mans. If not, Ford will take full ownership of Shelby American. At Daytona International Speedway, Beebe enters a second GT40 supported by a NASCAR team with quicker pit stops. However, Shelby clears Miles to push his car beyond the 7,000 RPM redline, and he wins.At the next race at Le Mans, Miles struggles with a faulty door during the first lap. The pit crew fixes it and Miles sets lap records, catching the Ferraris. The GT40 suffers brake fade while dicing with the prototype 330 P3 Ferrari of Lorenzo Bandini, so Miles limps into the pits for replacement of the entire braking system. Ferrari protests but Shelby assures race officials it is legal.Miles and Bandini duel on the Mulsanne Straight until the Ferrari breaks down, putting Bandini out of the race. With Fords in the top three positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other Fords to catch him and give the press a three car photo finish. Shelby tells Miles what Beebe wants but says it is Miles\\'s call. Miles initially continues to set new lap records, but decides to comply on the final lap.McLaren is declared the winner as, having started behind Miles, his car traveled further overall. Miles is placed second. Shelby accuses Beebe of deliberately costing Miles the win, but an unusually sanguine Miles lets it pass, saying to Shelby, You promised me the drive, not the win. From his vantage point, Enzo Ferrari tips his hat to Miles on the track. As they walk off together, Shelby tells Miles they will win Le Mans next time.Two months later, during testing at Riverside International Raceway, a mechanical failure in the Jcar kills Miles in a crash. Six months later, Shelby parks outside Miles\\'s widow Mollie\\'s house and hesitates. Miles\\'s son Peter arrives and the two talk about Miles. Shelby gives Peter a wrench that Miles once threw at him in anger.A textual epilogue text reveals Ford continued its Le Mans winning streak in 1967, 1968, and 1969, and Miles was posthumously inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2001.",

            "plot": "A poison-gas attack on a Kolkata Metro Rail compartment kills the passengers on board. Two years later, Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant British-Indian software engineer, arrives in Kolkata from London during the Durga Puja festivities in search of her missing husband, Arnab Bagchi. A police officer, Satyoki Rana Sinha, offers to help. Although Vidya claims that Arnab went to Kolkata on an assignment for the National Data Center NDC, initial investigations suggest that no such person was employed by the NDC. Agnes D Mello, the NDC\u2019s head of human resources, suggests to Vidya that her husband resembled former employee Milan Damji, whose file is probably kept in the old NDC office. Before Agnes can provide any further help, she is killed by Bob Biswas, an assassin working undercover as a life insurance agent. Agnes is shot at the entrance of her house, before which she is seen enjoying some music. Vidya and Rana break into the NDC office and find Damji\u2019s file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is searching for the same information. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji\u2019s records have attracted the attention of two Intelligence Bureau India Intelligence Bureau officials in Delhi\u2014the chief Bhaskaran K and his deputy Khan. Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was a rogue IB agent responsible for the poison gas attack. Despite Khan\u2019s warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab\u2019s resemblance to Damji may have led him into trouble. The address on Damji\u2019s record leads Vidya and Rana to a dilapidated flat. An errand boy from the neighbourhood tea stall identifies R Sridhar, an NDC officer, as a frequent visitor to Damji\u2019s flat. Bob attempts, but fails, to kill Vidya and is soon run over by a truck during a chase. Examination of Bob\u2019s mobile phone leads Vidya and Rana to an IP address, sending instructions to kill her. They break into Sridhar\u2019s office to verify his IP address, but he is alerted electronically and returns to his office. Vidya accidentally kills Sridhar during a scuffle, which upsets Khan, who had wanted him alive. Sridhar\u2019s computer data reveals a code, which when deciphered reveals Bhaskaran\u2019s phone number. Vidya calls Bhaskaran to tell him that she has retrieved sensitive documents from Sridhar\u2019s office. She asks Bhaskaran to help find her husband in exchange for the documents, but Bhaskaran tells her to contact the local police. Vidya soon gets a call from an unknown number, warning her that she should hand over the documents to the caller if she wishes to see her husband alive. Khan thinks the caller is Damji. Vidya goes to meet Damji, followed by Rana and Khan. Damji cuts the meeting short when Vidya expresses her doubt that he will be able to return her husband in exchange for the sensitive file, and he attempts to leave. Vidya tries to stop him, and in the ensuing struggle, Damji draws a gun on her. Vidya disarms him using the prosthetic belly she has been using to fake her pregnancy and promptly stabbing him in the neck with her hairstick before finally killing him with his own gun. She flees into the crowd before the police arrive, leaving a thank-you note for Rana and a pen drive containing data from Sridhar\u2019s computer, which leads to Bhaskaran\u2019s arrest. Rana concludes that neither Vidya nor Arnab Bagchi ever existed and that Vidya had been using the police and the IB to achieve her own ends. Vidya is revealed to be the widow of Major Arup Basu, an IB and Army officer and Damji\u2019s colleague, who was killed in the poison-gas attack, which also caused Vidya to immediately fall unconscious upon seeing her husband\u2019s corpse and suffer a miscarriage. In her mission to avenge his and their unborn child\u2019s deaths, Vidya was helped by the retired IB officer, Col Pratap Bajpayee, who suspected the involvement of a top IB official.",

            "plot": "Kabir Dewan (Abhay Deol), an architect at his fathers construction company in Mumbai, gets engaged to his girlfriend, Natasha Arora (Kalki Koechlin), who is an interior designer. Before their marriage, Kabir plans a three-week road trip bachelor party in Spain with his two childhood friends: Imran Qureshi (Farhan Akhtar), an advertising copywriter in Delhi; and Arjun Saluja (Hrithik Roshan), a successful investment banker in London. The trio has a long-standing pact that during the road trip, each of them will pick a surprise adventure sport that they all have to participate in together. Arjun is initially reluctant to take the trip for being too tied up with work, but eventually agrees after much emotional blackmailing. Meanwhile, Imran secretly plans to find his estranged biological father in Spain, after discovering letters from his late stepfather, Faisal Qureshi, although his widowed mother, Rahila (Deepti Naval), resists the thought and states that it was only Faisal who should be considered his real father. The trio flies to Spain separately and meets in Barcelona. They plan to visit Costa Brava, Seville and Pamplona. While there, Imran takes Kabir out to find an art gallery where they come across the work of Salman Habib, an artist who resides in Spain. On their way to Costa Brava, Imran and Kabir are annoyed when Arjun continues working. While Arjun is driving and answering a phone call related to work simultaneously, Imran casually grabs his mobile phone from his hand and throws it out of their moving car through the window, which results in a physical altercation. Arjun, in a fit of rage, accuses Imran of being unapologetic for being involved four years prior with Arjuns then-girlfriend, Sonali. However, Kabir stops the argument and advises them not to bring Sonali up as she was the main reason why the trip was cancelled four years prior. After reaching Costa Brava, the trio meets Laila (Katrina Kaif), an Anglo-Indian woman studying fashion design, whom Arjun is immediately attracted to, but Imran flirts with her and makes Arjun jealous. Kabir informs his friends that his choice of sport is underwater diving, and the trio later finds out that Laila is their diving instructor. Arjun, who cannot swim and is aquaphobic, receives assistance from Laila to overcome his fears, and finishes the sport successfully, gaining a new perspective of life. Laila then invites the trio to attend the La Tomatina festival with her in Bu\u00f1ol, interfering with Arjuns planned activity, but he accepts. Meanwhile, Natasha becomes suspicious that Kabir is involved with Laila after she sees her on a video call with him. Kabir tries to explain that Laila is just a friend who has been invited over to the trios villa for dinner, but Natasha refuses to believe him. She crashes the bachelor party trip, much to Kabirs discomfort. Imran spends time with Lailas friend, Nuria (Ariadna Cabrol), and Arjun with Laila, even opening up to Laila on his past. After the trio leaves for Seville, both Arjun and Laila realise they have fallen in love. Not to regret their parting, Laila pursues them on a motorbike and shares a passionate kiss with Arjun before bidding farewell. Arjun now feels much more at peace with himself, and Natasha is relieved of her suspicions about Kabir. On their way to Seville, Kabir drops Natasha off at the airport, while Arjun and Imran discuss Kabirs change in behaviour around Natasha. The trio then arrives at Seville to go skydiving, which is Arjuns choice of sport. During the task, Imran is forced to confront his acrophobia and hesitates to take part, but does so nevertheless. After skydiving, the trio visits a bar and becomes drunk. After a childish prank on a stranger backfires, they are arrested and held in custody by the police, until Imran reveals to his friends that Salman is his father. Imran calls Salman, who bails them out and takes them to his home. In an in-person conversation with Imran, Salman is proud of his biological sons hidden writing talent, but reveals that he never wanted the responsibility of married life or children while Rahila did. Imran realises that Salman still does not feel apologetic for abandoning Rahila and their unborn child, and storms out with a final request to Salman that he must apologise to him only when it is genuine. Realising how his actions must have hurt Arjun four years ago, Imran sincerely apologises to him, and Arjun, appreciating the genuineness of his apology, forgives Imran with a hug. On reaching Pamplona, the trio learns about the running of the bulls, which is Imrans choice of sport, baffling Kabir and Arjun. Imran calls Laila, who joins them in Pamplona. When confronted by his friends, Kabir reveals that he had actually proposed to Natasha by accident: he had purchased a ring as a birthday gift for his mother, and while showing it to Natasha during the celebration, she had misunderstood it for an engagement ring. Kabir eventually played along, spurred on by his familys approval. Arjun realises why this trip was so important to Kabir as no one apart from his friends would advise him to cancel his marriage. On the morning of the bull run, Imran suggests that they make another pact for if they survive the event: Imran vows to publish his secret poetry, Arjun vows to follow Laila to Morocco and live to the fullest, and Kabir vows to confess to Natasha that he is not willing to marry her. The trio completes the event successfully, gaining a renewed sense of life. In the epilogue, Imran, Kabir, Nuria and Natasha attend Arjun and Lailas marriage. Kabir and Natasha are no longer together, but are still friends, and Natasha introduces Kabir to her new partner, while Imrans poetry is revealed to have been published.",

            "plot": "Max Rockatansky, a survivor haunted by memories of all the people he failed to protect, is captured by cult leader Immortan Joes War Boys and taken to his fortress, the Citadel. Max, a universal donor, is forced to transfuse his blood to Nux, a sick War Boy. Meanwhile, Joe sends his lieutenant Imperator Furiosa in the armoured War Rig to trade produce and water for petrol and ammunition with two of his allies, the Bullet Farmer and the People Eater. When Joe realises his five wives are fleeing in the Rig, he leads his entire army in pursuit, calling on his allies to help. Nux joins the pursuit with Max strapped to his car, and a chasing battle ensues. After entering enemy territory and fending off a rival gang, Furiosa drives into a sandstorm and loses all of her pursuers except Nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to blow up the Rig. Max frees himself and restrains Nux, and Furiosa destroys Nuxs car. After the sandstorm, Max catches Furiosa repairing the Rig, accompanied by Joes wives: Toast, Capable, the Dag, Cheedo, and Angharad, the last of whom is heavily pregnant with Joes child. Max fights and subdues Furiosa, but her engine kill switch prevents him from stealing the Rig. He begrudgingly agrees to help Furiosas group escape Joes wrath. Nux sneaks onto the Rig and attempts to kill Furiosa, but the wives overpower him and throw him out. He rejoins Joes army when it catches up. Furiosa drives through a canyon controlled by a biker gang, having pre-arranged to trade petrol for safe passage. The bikers turn on her when they spot Joes army approaching, forcing her to flee. The bikers detonate the canyon walls to block Joe and then pursue the Rig as Max and Furiosa fend them off. Joe drives over the blockade in a monster truck and catches up with the Rig. He sends Nux to carjack the Rig, but Nux fails, to Joes disgust. While helping Max, Angharad falls off the Rig and Joe fatally runs her over. Capable finds Nux hiding in the Rig and consoles him as he laments his failure. At night, Furiosa and Max drive through a swamp and get stuck in the mud. They slow Joes forces with landmines, but the Bullet Farmer continues the pursuit in his ATV. Furiosa and Max work together to blind the Bullet Farmer and disable his ATV. Moved by Capables compassion, Nux joins the group and helps get the Rig moving again. In the morning, Furiosa tells Max that her group is escaping to a Green Place, the bountiful land where she grew up before she was kidnapped and brought to the Citadel. She spots a Green Place watchtower and identifies herself to the watchwoman, who summons their matriarchal clan, the Vuvalini. The Vuvalini recognise Furiosa as one of their own, but inform a devastated Furiosa that the Green Place was the now-uninhabitable swamp from the previous night, and that there are only seven Vuvalini left. The group decides to ride across an immense salt flat, hoping to find a new home on the other side. Max goes his own way. After seeing a vision of a child he failed to save, Max catches up with the group and convinces them to return to the Citadel, since they do not know what lies beyond the salt flat but do know that the now-undefended Citadel has ample water and crops. Joe intercepts them, and in the ensuing battle, five Vuvalini are killed, Toast is captured, and Furiosa is severely wounded. Joe overtakes the Rig as they approach the canyon. While Max fights Joes son and enforcer, Rictus, Furiosa boards Joes truck to rescue Toast, who distracts Joe, allowing Furiosa to kill him. The remnants of the group drive Joes truck back to the Citadel, while Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the Rig to block the canyon behind them, killing Rictus. Max transfuses his blood to Furiosa, saving her life. Back at the Citadel, the people rejoice upon learning of Joes death. As Maxs companions are lifted to Joes cliffside fortress, Max exchanges a glance with Furiosa before disappearing into the crowd.",

His Rust Belt neighborhood in Metro Detroit has become ridden with gang violence and poor Hmong immigrants, including Walt\\'s next-door neighbors, the Vang Lor family. Walt is estranged from his spoiled family, and on his 80th birthday, enragedly rejects his son\\'s suggestion that he move to a retirement community in favor of living alone with his elderly labrador Daisy. A chronic tobacco user, Walt suffers from coughing fits, occasionally spitting up blood. As Walt\\'s late wife requested, her priest, Father Janovich, tries to comfort Walt and persuade him to go to confession. Despite being harshly rejected by Walt, Father Janovich repeatedly tries to get through to him. 15-year-old Thao Vang Lor is coerced by a Hmong gang led by his cousin, \"Spider\", to steal Walt\\'s 1972 Ford Torino as an initiation. Walt catches Thao and thwarts the theft; Thao escapes after Walt nearly shoots him. When the gang tries to abduct Thao forcefully, Walt scares them off with his M1 Garand rifle, earning the local Hmong community\\'s respect. Thao\\'s mother makes him work for Walt as penance, who has him do different tasks to improve the local neighborhood. The two soon form a grudging mutual respect; Walt mentors Thao, helping him obtain a construction job. Walt also rescues Thao\\'s sister, Sue, from the unwanted advances of three African American gangsters. Despite his initial prejudices, Walt bonds with the Vang Lor family. With his cough worsening, Walt consults a doctor who gives him a gloomy prognosis that he conceals. After the gang assaults Thao on his way home from work, Walt physically assaults a member as a warning. In retaliation, the gang beats and rapes Sue and then injures Thao in a drive-by shooting. The family refuses to report the crimes out of fear. The following day, an enraged Thao seeks Walt\\'s help to exact revenge; Walt convinces him to return later that day. Walt buys a suit, gets a haircut, and finally confesses to Father Janovich. When Thao arrives, Walt takes him to his basement and gives him his Silver Star, telling him that he is haunted by the memory of killing an enemy child soldier who was trying to surrender to him, and he wants to spare Thao from shedding blood. He locks Thao in the basement and departs to the gang\\'s residence. When Walt arrives, the gang draws their guns on him as he berates them for their crimes, drawing the attention of the neighbors. Walt puts a cigarette in his mouth, slowly reaches into his jacket pocket, and pulls his hand out quickly. Thinking Walt is brandishing a pistol, the gang members shoot and kill him. Walt\\'s hand opens to reveal his Zippo lighter with the 1st Cavalry insignia. Following Walt\\'s directions, Sue frees Thao, and they arrive at the scene. A police officer tells Thao and Sue that Walt was unarmed and that the gang members have been arrested for murder. The officer goes on to say to them that the gang members will be going to prison for a very long time, thanks to the fact that witnesses have come forward. Father Janovich conducts Walt\\'s funeral, which his family and the Hmong community attend. Afterward, Walt\\'s last will and testament is read. Much to the dismay of Walt\\'s family, Walt leaves his house to the church and his cherished Gran Torino to Thao, on the condition that Thao does not modify the car. Sometime later, Thao drives the Torino along Detroit\\'s Jefferson Avenue with Daisy at his side.",

            "plot": "In 1976, eightyearold Mary Daisy Dinkle lives a lonely life in Mount Waverley, Victoria, Australia. Her classmates tease her because of a birthmark on her forehead. Her distant father, Noel, and alcoholic, kleptomaniac mother, Vera, provide little support. Her only comforts are her pet rooster, Ethel, her favourite food, sweetened condensed milk, and a Smurfslike cartoon show called The Noblets. While at the post office with her mother, Mary spots a New York City telephone book and, curious about Americans, decides to write to one. She randomly chooses Max Jerry Horowitz from the phone book and sends him a letter telling him about herself. Max is a morbidly obese 44yearold Jewish atheist who has trouble forming relationships due to various mental and social problems. Marys letter initially gives him an anxiety attack, but he writes back, and the two become friends partly due to their shared love of chocolate and The Noblets. Vera disapproves of Max, so Mary tells him to send his letters to her agoraphobic neighbour, Len Hislop. Mary asks Max about love, and he suffers a severe anxiety attack, being institutionalised for eight months. He wins the New York Lottery and buys a lifetime supply of chocolate and the entire collection of Noblet figurines. He gives the remainder to his elderly neighbour, Ivy, who pampers herself before dying in an accident. Mary becomes despondent, thinking Max has abandoned her. Max finally writes back to Mary, explaining he has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. The two continue their correspondence for the next several years. When Noel retires, he takes up metal detecting and is swept away by a large tidal bore while on a beach. The nowadult Mary goes to the University of Melbourne. She has her birthmark removed and develops a crush on her neighbour, Damien Popodopoulos. Vera accidentally kills herself after she drinks embalming fluid instead of cooking sherry. Mary and Damien later marry. Mary studies psychology and writes her doctoral dissertation on Asperger syndrome with Max as her case study. She sends Max a copy, and he is infuriated, believing she has taken advantage of him. He breaks off communication with Mary by removing the letter M from his typewriter. Mary has the entire run of her book pulped, ending her career. She becomes depressed and begins drinking. She finds a can of condensed milk and sends it to Max as an apology. She finds a letter from Damien informing her that he has left her for his pen pal, Desmond. After nearly choking a homeless man in anger all because he threw a cigarette on the ground, Max realises everyone is imperfect like himself. He sends Mary his Noblet figurine collection as a gesture of forgiveness. Mary fails to find the box on her doorstep for several days. Unaware she is pregnant, Mary decides to commit suicide. Having finally conquered his agoraphobia, Len alerts her of Maxs package. A letter from Max tells her of his realisation that they are not perfect. He also states how much their friendship means to him and hopes their paths will cross one day. Mary travels to New York with her infant child to visit Max. Mary discovers Max dead on his couch, gazing upward and smiling. Mary finds all the letters she sent Max over the years taped to the ceiling. Seeing how much Max valued their friendship, Mary cries tears of joy as she sits beside him on the couch.",

            "plot": "Margaret Maggie Fitzgerald, a waitress from the Ozarks, enters the Hit Pit, a rundown boxing gym in Los Angeles operated by Frankie Dunn. Dunn is a cantankerous Irish-American trainer, estranged from his daughter. Maggie asks Frankie to train her, but he refuses because he does not want to train women and believes Maggie is too old. Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, Frankies friend and the gyms handyman, allows her to train at the Hit Pit regardless. Frankies prize prospect, Big Willie Little, signs with rival manager Mickey Mack after becoming impatient with Frankie rejecting offers for a championship bout, so Maggie gets her chance. Maggie fights her way up in the womens amateur boxing division with Frankies coaching. Since she has earned a reputation for quick knockouts, Frankie bribes managers to put their trainee fighters against her. Scrap, concerned when Frankie rejects several offers for big fights, arranges a meeting for Maggie with Mack, but out of loyalty to Frankie, she declines. Frankie bestows Maggie a Gaelic nickname, embroidered on her boxing robe, Mo Chuisle, but does not tell her its meaning. The two travel to Europe as she continues to win. Maggie eventually saves enough of her winnings to buy her mother a house, but her mother berates Maggie for endangering her welfare checks, claiming that everyone back home is laughing at her. Frankie is finally willing to arrange a title fight. He secures Maggie a 1 million match in Las Vegas against the WBA womens welterweight champion, Billie the Blue Bear Osterman, a German ex-prostitute who has a reputation as a dirty fighter. Maggie begins to dominate the fight, but Billie knocks her out with an illegal sucker punch from behind after the bell rings to end the round. Maggie lands hard on her corner stool, breaking her neck and leaving her a ventilator-dependent quadriplegic. Frankie goes through the five stages of grief, seeking multiple doctors opinions in denial, lashing out in anger at Scrap, and trying to bargain with God through prayer. He later apologizes to Scrap and blames himself for Maggies injuries. Scrap tells him not to as Maggie owed it to him for getting her shot at the world championship. While in the hospital, Maggie looks forward to a visit from her family. They arrive late, having first toured Disneyland and Universal Studios Hollywood. Accompanied by an attorney, their sole concern is to get Maggies assets transferred to them. Disgusted, she orders them to leave and threatens to report their welfare fraud if they try to contact her again. Maggie develops bedsores and undergoes an amputation for an infected leg. She asks Frankie to help her die, declaring that she had everything she wanted out of life. A horrified Frankie refuses, so Maggie later bites her own tongue in an attempt to bleed to death. Knowing the fatherly affection Frankie has developed for Maggie, Frankies priest warns him that he would never find himself again if he were to go through with Maggies request. Frankie sneaks into the hospital one night, unaware that Scrap is watching from the shadows. Just before administering a fatal injection of adrenaline, he tells Maggie the meaning of mo chuisle: my darling, and my blood, then gives Maggie a final goodbye kiss. He leaves and retires from boxing altogether. Scrap writes to Frankies daughter, informing her of her fathers true character.",

            "plot": "In April 1994, tensions between the Hutu-controlled government and Tutsi rebels led to genocide in Rwanda, where corruption and bribes between politicians were routine. Paul Rusesabagina, manager of the Belgian-owned H\u00f4tel des Mille Collines, is Hutu, but his wife Tatiana is Tutsi. Their marriage is a source of friction with Hutu extremists, including Georges Rutaganda, a goods supplier to the hotel who is also the local leader of Interahamwe, a brutal Hutu militia.Paul curries favor with Rwandan Army  general Augustin Bizimungu, who favors the Hutu. Following the assassination of the president, a Hutu, Paul and his family observe neighbors being killed, initiating the early stages of the genocide. When civil war erupts and a Rwandan Army Captain threatens Paul and his neighbors, Paul barely negotiates their safety and brings them to the hotel. Upon returning with them, he finds his insolent receptionist Gregoire occupying the presidential suite and threatening to expose the Tutsi refugees, including Pauls wife, if he is made to work.The UN peacekeeping forces, led by Canadian Colonel Oliver, are forbidden to intervene in the conflict and prevent the genocide. Pauls boss and owner of the hotel, who lives in Belgium, apologizes to him over the phone, saying theres nothing he can do to provide safe passage for him and his family. The foreign nationals are evacuated, but the Rwandans are left behind to fend for themselves.More evacuees arrive at the hotel from the overburdened United Nations refugee camp, the Red Cross, and various orphanages, totaling 800, both Tutsi and Hutu. Tatiana desperately searches for her brother, sisterinlaw, and two nieces. As the situation becomes more violent, Paul must divert the Hutu soldiers, care for the refugees, protect his family, and maintain the appearance of a functioning 4star hotel. Paul forces Gregoire to work with the help of General Bizimungu.Low on supplies, Paul and Gregoire drive to collect hotel supplies from Georges Rutaganda and witness the Interahamwe militia raping Tutsi hostages. Georges explains to Paul that the rich cockroaches money will become worthless since all of the Tutsis will be killed. Paul expresses disbelief that the Hutu extremists will wipe out all of the Tutsis, but Georges replies: Why not? We are halfway there already. They return to the hotel through the dark, thick fog, on the riverside road recommended by Georges, only to find it is carpeted with dead bodies.When the UN forces attempt to evacuate a group of refugees, including Pauls family, Gregoire betrays them to the Interahamwe, who use radio broadcasts to accost them. After giving General Bizimungu the remaining valuables and Scotch from his office safe to protect the refugees, Paul then admonishes Bizimungu for genocide apathy and promises to testify on his behalf for his help.Soon afterward, Pauls family and the hotel refugees are finally able to leave the besieged hotel in a UN convoy. They travel through retreating masses of refugees and militia to reach safety behind Tutsi rebel lines and are reunited with their nieces.The end title cards explain that Paul saved at least 1200 Tutsi and Hutu refugees. He and his family, who adopted the two nieces, moved to Belgium, but Tatianas brother Thomas and his wife were never found. The genocide came to an end in July 1994 when the Tutsi rebels drove the Hutu and the Interahamwe militia across the border into the Congo. At least 800000 people died in the genocide. Georges and Bizimungu were tried and sentenced for war crimes, with Georges receiving a life sentence.",

During a book tour in Europe, he does a reading at Shakespeare and Company, where three journalists interview him: one is convinced the novel\\'s characters meet again, another that they do not, and a third who wants them to but is doubtful that will occur. C\u00e9line also attends the reading. Required to leave for the airport in an hour, Jesse and C\u00e9line use the time to roam Paris. Their conversations soon become deeply personal, and they passionately discuss work, politics and lament their failure to meet again in Vienna or exchange contact details. C\u00e9line informs she did not return as her grandmother died, and Jesse claims that he did not return either; after C\u00e9line asks him why he did not, he confesses that he did return. They reveal how their lives have changed in the nine years apart: Jesse is married and has a son named Hank, while C\u00e9line works for an environmental non-governmental organization and is in a relationship with a photojournalist. Their old romantic feelings become slowly rekindled while walking around Paris. Jesse says his novel was inspired by the hope of seeing C\u00e9line again, and she says that reading it caused painful memories. They both admit that their previous night together had profoundly affected their perceptions of love, leading to dissatisfaction in both of their lives as C\u00e9line has had difficulty maintaining relationships while Jesse\u2019s marriage is deeply strained. C\u00e9line and Jesse arrive at her apartment, even after continuous insistence that Jesse should not miss his flight. Jesse persuades her to play a waltz on her guitar, which she wrote about their encounter in Vienna. Jesse plays Nina Simone\\'s Just in Time on her stereo, which C\u00e9line dances to as he watches, the pair acknowledging he will miss his flight.",

            "plot": "Murliprasad Sharma is a gangster in Mumbai, known by the title Munna Bhai bhai means brother or don in the local dialect, who runs an extortion racket. Every year, with the help of his aide Sarkeshwar Circuit Sharma and his gang, he converts his hideout into a fullyfunctioning hospital to fool Munnas visiting parents Hariprasad and Parvati, who believe Munna is a real doctor. Meanwhile, one of Haris annual visits with Parvati culminates in Hari bumping into his friend Dr. Jagdish Asthana, who is the dean of a local medical college. Hari proposes to Asthana that they get his daughter and Munnas childhood friend Chinki married to him. Asthana agrees, even though Munna asks her to reject him, lest his parents discover the truth. However, when his maid reacts shockingly to Munnas photo, Asthana realizes the truth and exposes Munna to Hari and Parvati. Humiliated at their sons lack of a real vocation, they leave the city and return home. Munna vows to become a doctor to get back at Asthana but unknowingly ends up enrolling into his college with the help of home surgeon Dr. Rustom Pawri. Certain that Munna has cheated his way through the entrance exam, but lacking real evidence, he is forced to allow Munna to study there. Upon becoming a student, Munna falls back into his ways by enforcing his regime of common-sense treatment, directly challenging Asthanas conventional opinions to get under his skin. Despite the schools emphasis on mechanical, cartesian, impersonal, and often bureaucratic relationships between doctors and patients, Munna, who constantly seeks to impose a more empathetic and almost holistic regimen around himself, clashes with professors over their lack of empathy towards patients, especially those who are deemed incurable by conventional medicine. His behavior is wellreceived by the hospital staff and patients, who are able to see the goodnatured intent behind his antiestablishment actions. Asthana, perceiving this as chaos, is unable to stop it and resorts to laughter therapy to deal with his stress. Munna simultaneously develops a friendly relationship with Dr. Suman, who works at the hospital, unaware that she is Chinki, an ignorance she hilariously exploits, and uses oldfashioned kindness and love to cure many patients at the hospital, including Karan, a suicidal youngster he met on his first day of college, and Dr. Pawris father, who at one point fell ill and short of a desire to live. He even thanks an underappreciated janitor and arranges to bring a stripper inside the patient ward to cheer up Zaheer, a man dying from stomach cancer who he befriends in the process. When Asthana learns about the stripper episode, he sees this as a potential reason to expel Munna on disciplinary grounds but fails to do so after Munna injures himself to stay back. However, after he recovers, the hospital staff, patients and students stand in Asthanas way and refuse to let Munna leave. Munna is then made to take a test before the entire college the next day to keep his enrolment. Later that night, Zaheer dies; still in shock, Munna gives up at a point during the test and leaves; in the process, Anand Banerjee, a paraplegic patient who has been braindead for the last 12 years, comes back to life. Suman realizes Munna as the miracle behind Anands recovery and gives a heartfelt speech, defending his actions. Asthana, finally moved, is forced to change his opinion of Munna. Munna does not become a doctor, but news of his miraculous treatments reaches his parents. They return to the city and forgive him. Munna ends up marrying Suman after learning of her true identity, and together, they open a real hospital in Munnas family village. Circuit also gets married a year later and has a son nicknamed Short Circuit. Asthana resigns as the dean and becomes the head doctor, employing Munnas methods. As the film concludes, Anand, restored to normal mental health, narrates the story to a few children at the hospital as he is about to leave for Kolkata.",

During his youth, he witnesses his father\\'s many techniques for conning people, but Frank Sr.\\'s tax problems with the IRS eventually force the family to move from their house and into a small apartment.One day, Frank discovers his mother is having an affair with Jack Barnes, his father\\'s friend from the New Rochelle Rotary Club. When his parents divorce, Frank runs away. Needing money, he turns to confidence scams to survive, his cons progressively growing bolder. He poses as a Pan Am pilot named Frank Taylor and forges the airline\\'s payroll checks. Soon, his forgeries are worth millions of dollars.News of the crimes reaches the FBI and Carl begins tracking Frank. He finds him at a motel, but Frank tricks Carl into believing he is a Secret Service agent named Barry Allen. He escapes before Carl realizes he was fooled.Frank then begins to impersonate a doctor. As Dr. Frank Conners, he falls in love with Brenda, a naive young hospital nurse, and asks her attorney father for both her hand in marriage and help with arrangements to take the Louisiana State Bar exam, which Frank passes. Carl tracks Frank to his and Brenda\\'s engagement party, but Frank escapes through a bedroom window, telling Brenda to meet him at Miami International Airport two days later.At the airport, Frank spots Brenda, but also plainclothed agents. He realizes she has given him up, then drives away. Reassuming his pilot identity, he stages a recruiting drive for stewardesses at a local college. Surrounded by eight women as stewardesses, he conceals himself from Carl and the other agents at the airport and escapes on a flight to Madrid.In 1967, Carl tracks down Frank in his mother\\'s hometown of Montrichard, France, and convinces him to surrender to the French police. Frank is immediately arrested and taken into French custody, but Carl assures him that he will get him extradited back to the U.S.Picking back up once more in 1969, Carl takes Frank on a flight back to the U.S. As they approach, Carl informs Frank that Frank Sr. has died.

Frank surrenders to Carl and is sentenced to 12 years in a maximum-security prison.Carl occasionally visits Frank. During one visit, he shows him a fraudulent check from a case he is working on. Frank immediately deduces that the bank teller was involved in the fraud. Impressed, Carl convinces the FBI to allow him to serve the remainder of his sentence working for the FBI Financial Crimes Unit. Frank agrees but soon grows restless doing the tedious office work.One weekend, Frank prepares to impersonate a pilot again and is intercepted by Carl, who is willing to let him continue with his con, assuring him that no one is chasing him and that it\\'s his choice.  Frank returns to work and discusses another fraud case with Carl, who asks him how he cheated on the Louisiana State Bar exam. Frank tells him he studied and passed it. Carl smiles and asks Frank if he\\'s telling the truth, but Frank doesn\\'t answer, instead giving Carl input on a new fraud case.A postscript says that Frank lived for 26 years in the Midwestern United States with his wife, with whom he had three sons, remained friends with Carl, and made a living as a leading expert on bank fraud and forgery in the FBI.",

            "plot": "Selected at birth and legally adopted by a television studio following an unwanted pregnancy, Truman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of The Truman Show, a reality television program filmed and broadcast worldwide, 247, through approximately five thousand hidden cameras.Truman\\'s hometown, Seahaven Island, is set inside an enormous soundstage, which allows Christof, the show\\'s creator and executive producer, to control most aspects of Truman\\'s life, including the weather. Truman\\'s world is populated by actors and crew members who serve as his community while carefully keeping him from discovering the truth. They also earn revenue for the show through cleverly disguised product placement. To prevent Truman from escaping, Christof has orchestrated various scenarios, such as the death of Truman\\'s father in a boating accident to instill thalassophobia, and has the cast reinforce Truman\\'s anxieties with messages about the dangers of traveling and the virtues of staying home.Though the producers intend for Truman to fall in love with and marry a woman named Meryl, Truman develops feelings for Sylvia, an extra. Sympathetic to Truman\\'s plight, she tries to tell him the truth, but is fired and forcibly removed from the set before she can convince him. Truman eventually marries Meryl, but their relationship is stilted and passionless, and he secretly continues to imagine a life with Sylvia and dreams of traveling to Fiji, where he was told she had moved. Meanwhile, in the real world, Sylvia joins Free Truman, an activist group that calls for Truman\\'s liberation.As the show approaches its thirtieth anniversary, Truman begins to notice unusual occurrences, such as a stage light falling from the sky, an isolated patch of rain that falls only over him, a radio transmission describing his movements through town, and the reappearance of his father, who is rushed away by crew members before Truman can confront him. Deducing that the city somehow revolves around him, Truman begins questioning his life and asking who he sees as his closest confidants to help him solve the mystery.Truman\\'s suspicions culminate in an attempt to escape the island, but increasingly implausible occurrences block his path. Eventually, he is caught and returned home under a flimsy pretext. There, he confronts Meryl and challenges the sincerity of their marriage. A panicked Meryl tries to change the subject with a product placement, causing Truman to snap and hold her at knifepoint. Meryl breaks character to call for help and is removed from the show.Hoping to bring Truman back to a controllable state, Christof reintroduces his father to the show under the guise of him having developed amnesia after the boating accident. The show regains its ratings, and Truman seems to return to his routines. One night, however, Christof discovers that Truman has begun sleeping in his basement. Disturbed by this change in behavior, Christof sends Truman\\'s best friend Marlon to visit and discovers that Truman has disappeared through a makeshift tunnel in the basement. Christof suspends the broadcast for the first time in its history, leading to record viewing numbers.Christof orders a citywide search for Truman and is soon forced to break the production\\'s daynight cycle to optimize the hunt. Truman is found sailing away from Seahaven, having conquered his fear of water. Christof resumes the transmission and creates a violent storm in an attempt to capsize Truman\\'s boat. Truman nearly drowns, but he continues to sail until his boat strikes the wall of the dome. Horrified, Truman looks around and finds a staircase leading to an exit door. As he contemplates leaving, Christof speaks to Truman directly, revealing the truth about the show and encouraging him to stay by claiming that there is no more truth in the real world than in his artificial one. Truman utters his catchphrase: In case I don\\'t see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night, bows to the audience, and exits. Viewers around the world celebrate Truman\\'s escape, and Sylvia races to greet him. The executive producers end the program with a shot of the open exit door, leaving Christof devastated. After the broadcast ends, Truman\u2019s viewers look for something else to watch.",

One enforcer urinates on the Dudes rug before the two realize they have the wrong man and leave. Consulting his bowling partners, Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak and Donny Kerabatsos, the Dude visits wealthy philanthropist Jeffrey Lebowski the big Lebowski, requesting compensation for the rug. Lebowski refuses but the Dude tricks his assistant Brandt into letting him take a similar rug from the mansion. Outside, he meets Bunny, Lebowskis trophy wife and her German nihilist friend Uli. Soon afterward, Bunny is apparently kidnapped and Lebowski hires The Dude to deliver a ransom. That night, another group of thugs ambushes the Dude, taking his replacement rug on behalf of Lebowskis daughter Maude, who has a sentimental attachment to it. Convinced the kidnap was a ruse by Bunny, Walter fakes the ransom drop. He and the Dude return to the bowling alley, leaving the briefcase of money in the car trunk. While they are bowling, their car is stolen. The Dude is confronted by Lebowski, who has an envelope from the kidnappers containing a severed toe, supposedly Bunnys. Maude asks the Dude to help recover the money her father illegally withdrew from the familys charity foundation. The police recover the Dudes car. The briefcase is missing but the Dude finds a clue: a sheet of homework signed by a teenager named Larry Sellers. Walter learns that Larry is the goodfornothing son of Arthur Digby Sellers, a principal writer for the television show Branded, that Walter reveres. The Dude and Walter visit Larry but get no information from him, as Larry remains mute and affectless through Walters increasingly volatile and obscene interrogation. Walter assumes a sports car in front of Larrys house was purchased with the ransom and smashes it. The car actually belongs to a neighbor, who smashes the Dudes car in return. Jackie Treehorns thugs abduct the Dude and bring him to the porn kingpin, who demands to know where Bunny is and what happened to his money. The Dude says Bunny faked her kidnapping and Larry has the money then passes out from a spiked drink Treehorn gave him. He is arrested while wandering deliriously in Malibu and evicted by the police chief. On his way home Bunny whose toes are intact drives by, unnoticed by the Dude. Maude is waiting for the Dude at his home and has sex with him, wishing to become pregnant by a father with whom she will not have to interact. She tells the Dude that her father has no money of his own, his wealth came from her late mother. The Dude and Walter confront Lebowski and find Bunny has returned, having gone out of town without telling anyone. Bunnys nihilist friends took the opportunity to blackmail Lebowski, who in turn, had tried to embezzle money from the family charity, blaming its disappearance on the blackmailers. The Dude believes the briefcase never contained any money. An enraged Walter suspects Lebowski is faking his paralysis and lifts him out of his wheelchair but his condition is real. Walter and the Dude are bowling when a rival bowler, Jesus Quintana, interrupts them. Walter had previously stated that he could not bowl on Saturdays since he is shomer Shabbos. In a tirade, Quintana implies he does not believe Walters excuse for not bowling on Saturday, threatens Walter and the Dude and storms out. Outside the bowling alley, the nihilists set fire to the Dudes car and demand the ransom money. Walter fights them off but Donny dies from a heart attack. On a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Walter eulogizes Donnys passing, but ultimately ruins it by unrelatedly referring to his fallen comrades in Vietnam. As he scatters Donnys ashes, they are blown back onto the Dude by an illtimed updraft. As Walter tries to brush off the ashes, the Dude finally loses his temper and yells at him for everything that has happened. After apologizing and consoling the Dude, the two go bowling. At the bowling alley, the Dude encounters the Stranger, the movies narrator, who sums up everything that happened in the film and states that while he didnt like seeing Donny go, he remains inspired by the Dude and that Maude is pregnant with a little Lebowski on the way.",

A Welton alumnus who studied English Literature at Cambridge, Keating encourages his students to \"seize the day\", referencing the Latin expression carpe diem.Keating has the students take turns standing on his desk to demonstrate ways to look at life differently, tells them to rip out the introduction of their poetry books that explains a mathematical formula for rating poetry, and invites them to make up their own style of walking in a courtyard to encourage their individualism. Keating\\'s methods attract the attention of strict headmaster Gale Nolan.Upon learning that Keating had been a member of the unofficial Dead Poets Society during his time as a student at Welton, Neil restarts the club, and he and his friends sneak off campus to a cave, where they read poetry. Keating\\'s lessons and their involvement with the club encourage them to live their lives on their own terms. Knox pursues Chris Noel, a cheerleader who is dating Chet Danburry, a football player from a local public school, and whose family is friends with his.Neil discovers his love of acting, and gets the role of Puck in a local production of A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream, despite the disapproval of his controlling father, who wants him to attend Harvard to study medicine. Keating helps Todd come out of his shell and realize his potential when he takes him through an exercise in selfexpression, resulting in his spontaneously composing a poem in front of the class.Charlie publishes an article in the school newspaper, on behalf of the club, recommending that girls be admitted to Welton. In response, Nolan paddles Charlie, attempting to force him to reveal who else is in the Dead Poets Society; but Charlie remains defiant. Nolan also confronts Keating, advising him that he should discourage his students from questioning authority. Keating admonishes the boys, warning them that one must assess all potential consequences of one\\'s actions.On the eve of the play\\'s opening performance, Neil\\'s father discovers his involvement in the play and demands that he quit immediately. Keating advises Neil to stand his ground to prove to his father that he takes acting seriously. After Neil performs in the play, his father retaliates by withdrawing him from Welton and enrolling him in Braden Military School. Lacking any support from his mother and unable to explain to his father how he feels, Neil commits suicide using his father\\'s gun.At Neil\\'s parents\\' request, Nolan investigates his death. During the investigation, Cameron shifts blame onto Keating to avoid punishment for his role in the Dead Poets Society, and he names the other members of the group. When Charlie confronts him over this, Cameron urges the other students to let Keating take the fall. Charlie punches Cameron and is expelled. Each of the boys is called to Nolan\\'s office to sign a letter confirming Cameron\\'s false allegations. When Todd\\'s turn comes, he reluctantly signs the letter under the pressure of his parents, and Keating is fired as a result.Nolan, who had taught English at Welton prior to becoming headmaster, temporarily takes over Keating\\'s English class. As Keating interrupts the class to gather his belongings, Todd confesses that the boys were pressured into signing the letter that led to his dismissal. Keating assures Todd that he believes him. Nolan threatens to expel Todd and anyone else who speaks out of line. Despite the threat, Todd stands up on his desk and says \"O Captain! My Captain!\".  The other members of the Dead Poets Society, except for Cameron, along with several other students in the class, follow suit. Touched by their support, Keating proudly thanks the boys before departing.",

            "plot": "In the early part of the 20th century, Iquitos, Peru, a small city east of the Andes in the Amazon basin, is experiencing rapid growth due to a rubber boom, and many Europeans and North African Sephardic Jewish immigrants are settling in the city, bringing their cultures with them. One immigrant, an Irishman named Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald known by the locals as Fitzcarraldo, is a lover of opera and a great fan of the internationallyrenowned Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. He dreams of building an opera house in Iquitos, but, although he has an indomitable spirit, he has little capital. The Peruvian government has parceled up the areas in the Amazon basin known to contain rubber trees. However, the best parcels having already been leased to private companies for exploitation, Fitzcarraldo has been trying and failing to make the money to bring opera to Iquitos by various other means, including an ambitious attempt to construct a TransAndean Railway.A rubber baron shows Fitzcarraldo a map and explains that, while the only remaining unclaimed parcel in the area is on the Ucayali River, a major tributary of the Amazon, it is cut off from the Amazon and access to Atlantic ports by a lengthy section of rapids. Fitzcarraldo notices that the Pachitea River, another Amazon tributary, comes within several hundred meters of the Ucayali upstream of the parcel. He leases the inaccessible parcel from the government, and his paramour, Molly, a successful brothel owner, funds his purchase of an old steamship, which he christens the SS Molly Aida, from the rubber baron. After fixing up the boat, Fitzcarraldo recruits a crew and takes off up the Pachitea, which is largely unexplored because of the hostile indigenous people who live on its banks.Fitzcarraldo intends to go to the closest point between the Ucayali and the Pachitea, pull his threedeck, 320ton steamship up the muddy 40\u00b0 hillside, and portage it from one river to the next. He plans to use the ship to collect rubber harvested along the upper Ucayali and then transport the rubber over to the Pachitea and, on different ships, down to market at Atlantic ports.Soon after they enter indigenous territory, the majority of Fitzcarraldos crew, who are unaware of his full plan, abandon the expedition, leaving only the captain, engineer, and cook. The natives are impressed by the steamship and, once they make contact, agree to help Fitzcarraldo without asking many questions. After months of work and great struggles, they successfully pull the ship over the mountain using a complex system of pulleys and aided by the ships anchor windlass. The crew falls asleep after a drunken celebration, and the chief of the natives severs the rope securing the ship to the shore. Fitzcarraldo awakens as the boat is going through the Ucayali rapids, and is unable to stop it. The ship does not sustain any major damage, but Fitzcarraldo is forced to abandon his quest. Before returning to Iquitos, he learns that the natives helped him move the ship so they could attempt to appease the river gods by shooting the rapids in the enormous ship.Despondent, Fitzcarraldo sells the steamship back to the rubber baron, but there is time before the title changes hands for him to send for a European opera company that he hears is in Manaus. Lacking an opera house, they construct their sets on the deck of the ship, and the entire city of Iquitos comes down to the riverbank to watch as Fitzcarraldo floats it by, managing to bring opera to the city after all.",

            "plot": "In 2019 Los Angeles, former police officer Rick Deckard is detained by Officer Gaff, who likes to make origami figures, and is brought to his former supervisor, Bryant. Deckard, whose job as a blade runner was to track down bioengineered humanoids known as replicants and terminally retire them, is informed that four replicants are on Earth illegally. Deckard begins to leave, but Bryant ambiguously threatens him and Deckard stays. The two watch a video of a blade runner named Holden administering the Voight-Kampff test, which is designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional responses to questions. The test subject, Leon, shoots Holden on the second question. Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and three other Nexus-6 replicants: Roy Batty, Zhora, and Pris.Bryant has Deckard meet with the CEO of the company that creates the replicants, Eldon Tyrell, so he can administer the test on a Nexus-6 to see if it works. Tyrell expresses his interest in seeing the test fail first and asks him to administer it on his assistant Rachael. After a much longer than standard test, Deckard concludes privately to Tyrell that Rachael is a replicant who believes she is human. Tyrell explains that she is an experiment who has been given false memories to provide an emotional cushion, and that she has no knowledge of her true nature.In searching Leon\\'s hotel room, Deckard finds photos and a scale from the skin of an animal, which is later identified as a synthetic snake scale. Deckard returns to his apartment where Rachael is waiting. She tries to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo, but Deckard reveals that her memories are implants from Tyrell\\'s niece, and she leaves in tears.Replicants Roy and Leon meanwhile investigate a replicant eye-manufacturing laboratory and learn of J. F. Sebastian, a gifted genetic designer who works closely with Tyrell. Pris locates Sebastian and manipulates him to gain his trust.A photograph from Leon\\'s apartment and the snake scale lead Deckard to a strip club, where Zhora works. After a confrontation and chase, Deckard kills Zhora. Bryant also orders him to retire Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation. Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd, but he is ambushed by Leon, who knocks the gun out of Deckard\\'s hand and beats him. As Leon is about to kill Deckard, Rachael saves him by using Deckard\\'s gun to kill Leon. They return to Deckard\\'s apartment and, during a discussion, he promises not to track her down. As Rachael abruptly tries to leave, Deckard restrains her and forces her to kiss him, and she ultimately relents. Deckard leaves Rachael at his apartment and departs to search for the remaining replicants.Roy arrives at Sebastian\\'s apartment and tells Pris that the other replicants are dead. Sebastian reveals that because of a genetic premature aging disorder, his life will be cut short, like the replicants that were built with a four-year lifespan. Roy uses Sebastian to gain entrance to Tyrell\\'s penthouse. He demands more life from his maker, which Tyrell says is impossible. Roy confesses that he has done questionable things but Tyrell dismisses this, praising Roy\\'s advanced design and accomplishments in his short life. Roy kisses Tyrell and then kills him by crushing his skull. Sebastian tries to flee and is later reported dead.At Sebastian\\'s apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but he kills her as Roy returns. Roy\\'s body begins to fail as the end of his lifespan nears. He chases Deckard through the building and onto the roof. Deckard tries to jump onto another roof but is left hanging on the edge. Roy makes the jump with ease and, as Deckard\\'s grip loosens, Roy hoists him onto the roof to save him. Before Roy dies, he laments that his memories will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Gaff arrives to congratulate Deckard, also reminding him that Rachael will not live, but then again, who does? Deckard returns to his apartment to retrieve Rachael. While escorting her to the elevator, he notices a small origami unicorn on the floor. He recalls Gaff\\'s words and departs with Rachael.",

However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injured hand, and that all other potential replacements are either booked up or unable to get into shape in time. Having already invested heavily into the fight, Creed decides to give a local contender a chance to challenge him.Creed selects Rocky Balboa, an Italian-American journeyman southpaw boxer who fights primarily in small gyms and works as a collector for a Mafia loan shark, on the basis of his nickname, The Italian Stallion. Rocky fights in a local Philadelphia fight club, and he won his last fight with Spider Rico. He meets with promoter George Jergens, who tells him Creed has selected Rocky to fight him for the World Heavyweight Championship. Reluctant at first, Rocky eventually agrees to the fight, which will pay him $150,000. Rocky undergoes several weeks of unorthodox training, such as using sides of beef as punching bags.Rocky is later approached by Mickey Goldmill, a former bantamweight fighter-turned-trainer whose gym Rocky frequents, about further training. Rocky is not willing initially, as Mickey has not shown much interest in helping him before and saw him as a wasted talent, but eventually Rocky accepts the offer.Rocky begins to build a romantic relationship with Adrian Pennino, a shy woman who is working part-time at the J&M Tropical Fish pet store. Adrians brother and Rockys best friend, Paulie, helps Rocky get a date with his sister and offers to work as a cornerman with him for the fight, an offer Rocky turns down. Paulie becomes jealous of Rockys success, but Rocky placates him by agreeing to advertise the meat packing business where Paulie works for sponsorship as part of the upcoming fight, and both of them reconcile. Rocky trains extensively for the championship fight, while Apollo is unconcerned about the match and puts more effort into promotion than training. The night before the match, Rocky visits the Spectrum and begins to lose confidence. He confesses to Adrian that he does not believe he can win, but strives to go the distance against Creed, which no other fighter has done, to prove himself to everyone.On New Years Day, the fight is held with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as George Washington and then Uncle Sam. Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first roundthe first time that Creed has ever been knocked down. Humbled and worried, Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight, though his ego never fully fades. The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds, with both combatants sustaining various injuries: Rocky, with hits to the head and swollen eyes, requires his right eyelid to be cut to restore his vision, while Apollo, with internal bleeding and a broken rib, struggles to breathe. As the fight concludes, Creeds superior skill is countered by Rockys apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches and his dogged refusal to go down. As the final bell sounds, with both fighters embracing each other, they promise each other there will be no rematch.The fight is extremely well received by the sportscasters and the audience. Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down as Paulie distracts security to help her get into the ring. As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a split decision, Rocky and Adrian embrace and profess their love for each other, not caring about the outcome of the fight.",

            "plot": "In the 1750s Kingdom of Ireland, Redmond Barry\\'s father is killed in a duel. Barry becomes infatuated with his cousin Nora Brady, and shoots her suitor, British Army captain John Quin, in a duel. He flees but is robbed by highwaymen on his way to Dublin. Penniless, Barry enlists in the British Army. Family friend Captain Grogan informs him that Quin is not dead: the duel was staged so that Nora\\'s family could get rid of Barry and improve their finances through her marriage to Quin.Barry serves with his regiment in Germany during the Seven Years\\' War, but deserts after Grogan dies in combat against the French Royal Army. Absconding with a lieutenant\\'s horse and uniform, Barry has a brief affair with Frau Lieschen, a married German peasant woman. On his way to Bremen, he encounters Captain Potzdorf, who sees through the ruse and impresses him into the Prussian Army. Barry later saves Potzdorf\\'s life and receives a commendation from Frederick the Great.At the end of the war, Barry is recruited by Captain Potzdorf\\'s uncle into the Prussian Ministry of Police. The Prussians suspect that the Chevalier de Balibari, an Austrian diplomat and professional gambler, is in fact an Irishman and a spy for Empress Maria Theresa, and assign Barry to become his manservant. An emotional Barry confides everything to the Chevalier and they become confederates. After they win an enormous sum from the Prince of T\u00fcbingen at cards, the Prince deduces that he has been cheated and refuses to pay his debt; the Chevalier in turn threatens to demand satisfaction. To avoid a scandal, the Ministry of Police pays off the debt and quietly escorts the Chevalier outside Prussian borders, which allows Barry, disguised as the Chevalier, to leave the country as well.Barry and the Chevalier travel across Europe, perpetrating similar gambling scams, with Barry forcing payment from debtors with sword duels. In Spa, he encounters the beautiful, wealthy, and visibly depressed Lady Lyndon. He seduces her, and goads her elderly husband Sir Charles Lyndon to death with verbal repartee.In 1773, Barry marries Lady Lyndon, takes her last name and settles in England. The Countess bears Barry a son, Bryan Patrick, whom Barry spoils. The marriage is unhappy: Barry is openly unfaithful and squanders his wife\\'s wealth while keeping her in seclusion. Lord Bullingdon, Lady Lyndon\\'s son by Sir Charles, still grieves for his father and sees Barry as a gold digger who does not love his mother. Barry responds with years of escalating emotional and physical abuse.Barry\\'s mother comes to live with him and warns him that if Lady Lyndon dies, Bullingdon will inherit everything. She advises her son to obtain a title. To this end, Barry cultivates the influential Lord Wendover and spends even larger sums of Lady Lyndon\\'s money to ingratiate himself with high society. Bullingdon, now a young adult, interrupts a society party Barry throws. He publicly accuses his stepfather of infidelity, abuse and financial mismanagement, and announces that he will leave the Lyndon estate for as long as Barry remains there. Barry responds by brutally assaulting Bullingdon until they are physically separated by the party attendees. In the aftermath, Barry is ostracised by high society and plunges further into financial ruin.Barry arranges to gift Bryan a full-grown horse for his ninth birthday. An impatient Bryan rides the horse unaccompanied and dies in a riding accident. Barry sinks into alcoholism, while Lady Lyndon seeks religious counseling from clergyman Samuel Runt, who had been tutor to Bullingdon and Bryan and a longtime companion of Lady Lyndon. When Barry\\'s mother dismisses Runt to keep her son from losing control, Lady Lyndon attempts suicide. Runt and Graham, the family\\'s steward, write to Bullingdon, who returns to the estate and challenges his stepfather to a duel.After Bullingdon misfires the first shot, Barry fires into the ground in an effort to abort the duel. Bullingdon refuses to accept this as satisfaction and shoots Barry in the leg, forcing an amputation below the knee. While Barry is recovering, Bullingdon takes control of the Lyndon estate. Through Graham, he reminds Barry that his credit is exhausted and offers him 500 guineas a year to leave Lady Lyndon, her estates, and England forever. Barry grudgingly accepts and resumes his former gambling profession, but without any real success. In December 1789, a melancholic Lady Lyndon signs Barry\\'s annuity cheque as her son looks on.",

            "plot": "In early 1950s Florida, decorated World War II veteran Lucas Luke Jackson drunkenly beheads several parking meters. He is sentenced to two years on a chain gang in a prison camp run by the Captain, a stern warden, and Walking Boss Godfrey, a quiet rifleman nicknamed the man with no eyes because he always wears mirrored sunglasses. There, even minor violations are punished by a night in the box, a small wooden booth in the prison yard with limited air and space.Luke refuses to observe the established order among the prisoners and quickly runs afoul of their leader, Dragline. When the two have a boxing match, Luke is severely outmatched but refuses to acquiesce. Eventually, Dragline stops the fight, but Lukes tenacity earns the prisoners respect and draws the guards attention. He later wins a poker game by bluffing with a hand worth nothing, and Dragline christens him Cool Hand Luke.After a visit from his sick mother, Arletta, Luke becomes more optimistic about his situation. He repeatedly shows defiance to the Captain and the guards, and his sense of humor and independence prove inspiring to the other prisoners. Lukes struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than a day. The prisoners start to idolize him after he wins a bet that he can eat 50 hard-boiled eggs in an hour.One evening, Luke receives notice that his mother has died. Anticipating that Luke might attempt to escape to attend the funeral, the Captain has him locked in the box. After being released, Luke becomes determined to escape. Under cover of a Fourth of July celebration, he makes his initial escape attempt. He is recaptured by local police and returned to the chain gang. The Captain has Luke fitted with leg irons and delivers a warning speech to the inmates.Shortly afterward, Luke escapes a second time. While free, Luke mails the prison a magazine that includes a photograph of himself with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. The Captain warns Luke that he will be killed if he ever attempts to escape again. Luke becomes annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and says he faked it. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but when Luke returns after a long stay in the box and is punished by being forced to eat a massive serving of rice, the others help him finish it.For his escape, the guards brutalize Luke to the point of exhaustion, particularly when he is forced to repeatedly dig and refill a grave-sized hole in the prison yard. He eventually breaks down and begs for mercy, losing the respect of his fellow inmates. Luke seems to succumb to cowardice and become an errand boy for the guards, but when an opportunity presents itself, he flees again by stealing a truck, with Dragline joining him. After abandoning the truck, the pair agree to separate. Luke enters a church and talks to God, whom he blames for sabotaging him so he cannot win in life. Police cars appear moments later, and Dragline arrives to tell him that he will not be hurt if he surrenders peacefully. Instead, Luke mockingly repeats the Captains warning speech at the police. Godfrey shoots him in the neck. Dragline carries Luke outside and surrenders, but charges at Godfrey and strangles him until he is subdued by the guards.While Luke is loaded into the Captains car, Dragline tearfully implores him to live. Despite protests from local police, the Captain decides to take Luke to the distant prison infirmary instead of the local hospital to ensure Luke will not survive the trip. As the car drives away, a semi-conscious Luke weakly smiles while the tires crush Godfreys sunglasses. It is implied that Luke soon dies of his injuries.Some time later, the prison crew works near a rural intersection close to where Luke was shot, with Dragline now wearing leg irons and a new Walking Boss supervising. Dragline and the other prisoners fondly reminisce about Luke.",

            "plot": "Nine young samurai believe that the lord chamberlain, Mutsuta, is corrupt after he tore up their petition against fraud at court. One of them tells the superintendent Kikui of this and he agrees to intervene. As the nine meet secretly to discuss this at a shrine, a r\u014dnin overhears and cautions them against trusting the superintendent. While at first they do not believe him, he saves them from an ambush. But as their rescuer is about to leave, he realises that Mutsuta and his family must now be in danger and decides to stay and help. By the time the samurai get to Mutsuta\\'s house, the chamberlain has been abducted and his wife and daughter are held prisoner there. Following the r\u014dnin\\'s suggestion, a servant from the house gets the guards drunk, allowing the samurai to free the women. Then the group hide in a house next door to the superintendent\\'s compound. When Mutsuta\\'s wife asks the r\u014dnin his name, he looks out of the window at the surrounding camellia trees and says it is Tsubaki Sanj\u016br\u014d, literally \"thirty-year-old camellia\". The lady then criticises \"Sanjuro\" for killing too frequently and insists that \"the best sword is kept in its sheath\". Sanjuro decides to get closer to the corrupt officials and joins their henchman Hanbei, who had previously offered him a job after the ambush at the shrine. Although the samurai distrustfully decide to keep watch on him, Sanjuro realises he is being followed as he walks along with Hanbei, and their shadows are easily captured and bound. Made to believe that a much larger group may be involved, Hanbei leaves to request reinforcements. Sanjuro then frees the four captured samurai, although having to kill all their guards. He tells the four to leave him tied up, then explains to Hanbei on his return that he did not wish to die in a cause in which he had no stake. The chamberlain\\'s whereabouts are not discovered until the next day, when Mutsuta\\'s wife and daughter find a piece of the torn petition in the small stream that flows from the superintendent\\'s compound past their hideout. Since an attack on the officials is impossible with the compound full of armed men, Sanjuro hatches a plan to get the army away by reporting to Hanbei that he saw the rebels at a temple where he was sleeping. Meanwhile he has told his group of samurai that he will send the signal to attack by floating large numbers of camellias down the stream. The first part of the plan works, with the superintendent\\'s forces rushing off to the temple; however, Hanbei becomes suspicious after catching Sanjuro trying to drop the camellias into the stream and ties him up. Just as Hanbei is preparing to kill him, the remaining corrupt officials realise that Sanjuro has tricked them\u2014his description of the temple was incorrect. They convince Hanbei not to waste any further time and instead catch up with the superintendent\\'s forces and have them return as soon as possible. However, Sanjuro tricks the officials into giving the signal for the samurai to come to the rescue. Hanbei returns to find he has been made a fool of once again. Mutsuta is restored to his position and the superintendent commits hara-kiri, much to the chamberlain\\'s regret, as he wished to avoid a public scandal. As his family and the loyal samurai are celebrating, they discover that Sanjuro has slipped away. The samurai race off to find Sanjuro and Hanbei about to duel. Sanjuro is reluctant to fight and tries to dissuade Hanbei, but Hanbei is furious at his loss of dignity and declares he can only find peace by killing Sanjuro. Hanbei draws his sword, but the faster Sanjuro kills him. When the young samurai cheer his victory, Sanjuro becomes angry, stating that Hanbei was just like him: \"a sword unsheathed\". Also warning that he will kill them if they follow him. His admirers can only kneel and bow as he walks away.",

            "plot": "Near the turn of the 20th century, U.S. Senator Ransom Ranse Stoddard and his wife Hallie arrive in Shinbone, a frontier town in an unnamed Western state, to attend the funeral of Tom Doniphon. When asked by the local newspaper reporter why a senator would attend the funeral of a poor rancher, Stoddard answers with a story that flashes back 25 years. Entering the thenunincorporated territory as a young lawyer, Ranse is beaten and robbed by infamous outlaw Liberty Valance and his gang. Tom Doniphon and his handyman, Pompey, find Ranse and take him to Shinbone, where Tom\\'s girlfriend, Hallie, treats his wounds. Ranse learns Valance frequently terrorizes Shinbone and the surrounding country since the local marshal, Link Appleyard, is too cowardly to stop him. Tom says Valance only understands force, but Ranse is determined to bring Valance to justice through the law. While establishing his practice, Ranse buses tables at Peter Ericson\\'s steakhouse, where Hallie works, and befriends Dutton Peabody, the editor of the Shinbone Star newspaper. After learning Hallie is illiterate, Ranse opens a school for children and adults in the back of the newspaper\\'s office. He also begins practicing with Peabody\\'s old gun after Valance bullies him in the restaurant. Hallie tells Tom of Ranse\\'s gun practice. Tom takes Ranse to his ranch for a shooting lesson, shows off renovations that are intended for his planned marriage to Hallie and makes those intentions clear to Ranse. During the lesson, he tricks Ranse by shooting a paint can above his head and staining his clothes, telling Ranse he can expect the same kind of trickery from Valance. Ranse angrily punches Tom and leaves. Shinbone\\'s men meet to elect two delegates to the upcoming statehood convention at the territorial capital. Tom refuses Ranse\\'s nomination; ultimately, Ranse and Peabody are elected. Valance, hired by the cattle barons who oppose statehood, fails to intimidate the voters into selecting him. Valance challenges Ranse to a gunfight. Tom offers to assist Ranse in leaving town, but Ranse stubbornly declines. That evening, Valance and his gang vandalize the newspaper office and severely injure Peabody for reporting Valance\\'s murder of a local farmer. Ranse arms himself and goes after Valance; even drunk, Valance easily wounds and disarms Ranse, then prepares to kill him. Ranse retrieves his gun and shoots, and Valance falls dead. Ranse returns to Ericson\\'s, where Hallie treats his wounded arm; Tom enters and sees Hallie\\'s affection for Ranse as she attends his wounds. He gets drunk and forces Appleyard to run Valance\\'s men out of town. Tom then attempts suicide by setting fire to his house, but Pompey rescues him. At the territorial convention, Ranse is nominated for delegate to Congress, but withdraws after a representative of the cattle barons accuses him of building a career from murdering a man. Tom arrives and explains to Ranse that it was he who killed Valance; knowing that Ranse could not beat Valance, Tom shot him with Pompey\\'s rifle at the same time Ranse fired. Tom encourages Ranse to accept the nomination for Hallie\\'s sake before quietly walking out of the convention. In the present, Ranse\\'s rising political achievements \u2013 state governor, senator, ambassador to the United Kingdom, and likely vice-presidential nominee in the upcoming election \u2013 fill the intervening years. The newspaper editor decides publishing the story would ruin Ranse\\'s legacy, burns the reporter\\'s notes, and leaves Ranse to conduct Tom\\'s funeral. When Ranse asks why, the editor says when the legend becomes fact, print the legend. On the return trip to Washington, D.C., Ranse contemplates retiring to Shinbone, which pleases Hallie. Hallie admits placing a cactus rose on Tom\\'s coffin, a plant Tom knew Hallie liked. As Ranse thanks the train conductor for the railroad\\'s courtesies, the conductor answers, Nothing\\'s too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance",

            "plot": "In 1943, a contingent of British prisoners of war, led by Colonel Nicholson, arrive at a Japanese prison camp in Thailand. Commander Shears tells Nicholson that the camp conditions are horrific. Nicholson forbids any escape attempts because headquarters ordered them to surrender. Also, the dense surrounding jungle renders escape virtually impossible.Colonel Saito, the camp commandant, informs the prisoners they will construct a railway bridge over the River Kwai connecting Bangkok and Rangoon. Nicholson objects, citing the Geneva Convention exempting officers from manual labour. Saito threatens to have the officers shot, but Major Clipton, the British medical officer, warns him there are too many witnesses. The officers are left standing in the intense heat until evening when Saito then confines them to a punishment hut. Nicholson is beaten and locked in an iron box.Shears and two other prisoners try to escape, though only Shears survives. Wounded, he wanders into a Thai village, where he is nursed back to health. He eventually recuperates in the British colony of Ceylon.The bridge construction proceeds badly due to incompetent Japanese engineering and the prisoners slow pace and sabotage. Saito informs Nicholson he is expected to commit ritual suicide if the construction is not completed by the deadline. Desperate, he releases Nicholson and his officers, exempting them from manual labour. Nicholson, shocked by the poor job his men have done, orders the design and building of a proper bridge. He considers it a lasting tribute to the British Armys ingenuity but Clipton argues it is collaboration with the enemy. Nicholsons obsession drives him to volunteer his officers to work on the project.Major Warden tries to recruit Shears for a commando mission to destroy the bridge. Shears refuses, revealing he impersonated an officer in hopes of better treatment as a prisoner. He is informed that they already knew of his deception, and that he has been temporarily transferred to the British military and therefore has no choice. Warden, Shears, and two others\u2014Chapman and Joyce\u2014parachute into Thailand. Chapman dies on landing, and Warden is wounded in an encounter with a Japanese patrol. Khun Yai, a village chief, and a group of Thai women guide Warden, Shears, and Joyce to the river. Under cover of darkness, Shears and Joyce plant explosives at the base of the bridge towers. The first train to cross the bridge is scheduled for the following day, and Warden wants to destroy both the train and the bridge. By daybreak, however, the river level has dropped, exposing the wire leading to the detonator.Nicholson spots the wire, and he and Saito investigate as the train approaches. Nicholson pulls up the wire on the riverbank, leading them toward Joyce, who is manning the detonator. Joyce breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson inexplicably calls to Japanese soldiers for help and attempts to stop Joyce from reaching the detonator. After Joyce is shot, Shears swims across the river to detonate the explosives, but is wounded. Recognizing Shears, Nicholson exclaims, What have I done? Warden fires a mortar, fatally wounding Nicholson. Dazed, Nicholson stumbles towards the detonator and falls on the plunger, blowing up the bridge; the train tumbles into the river. Witnessing the carnage, Clipton exclaims, Madness!  Madness!",

Terry now works for Friendlys labor union as a longshoreman while his older, more educated brother Charley is Friendlys right-hand man. Terry is coerced into luring fellow worker Joey Doyle onto a rooftop, where he believes Friendlys henchmen want to talk Joey out of testifying to the Waterfront Crime Commission. When they instead murder Joey by throwing him off the roof, Terry confronts Friendly, but is threatened and bribed into acquiescence. Joey's sister Edie and priest Father Barry try to inspire the dockworkers to stand up to Friendly. Terry attends the meeting as a snitch, but when it is violently broken up by Friendlys men, he helps Edie escape and misses Father Barry convincing one worker to testify. After the testimony, the worker is killed in a staged workplace accident. Terry's own unwillingness to testify is softened by his growing feelings for Edie and her and Father Barrys pursuit of justice. He confesses his role in Joys death to both. Shocked by this, Edie distances herself from him. Friendly sends Charley with a job offer to keep Terry quiet. Knowing refusal will get Terry killed, Charley urges him to comply. When Terry expresses regret about throwing his best fight and blames Charley for setting up the fix, Charley hands him a gun and tells him to run. Terry finds Edie and they kiss. After hearing someone in the street, they find Charley murdered. Determined to kill Friendly, Terry is convinced by Father Barry to instead testify in court. Following the hearing, Friendly loses his powerful connections and faces indictment. When he is excluded from the next hiring call at the harbor, Terry confronts Friendly together with the other workers, saying that he is proud of testifying and no longer betraying himself. After seeing Terry get beaten severely by Friendlys thugs, the longshoremen refuse to work without him and renounce Friendly, wishing to run the union on the up-and-up. Encouraged by Edie and Father Barry, Terry stumbles to the warehouse. The men follow him inside and the door closes, leaving Friendly outside, ignored by the workers and shippers.",

            "plot": "Holly Martins, an American author of Western pulp novels, arrives in the British sector of Allied-occupied Vienna seeking Harry Lime, a childhood friend who has offered him a job. However, Martins is told that Lime was killed by a car while crossing the street. At Lime\\'s funeral, Martins meets two Royal Military Police officers: Sergeant Paine, a fan of Martins\\' novels, and Major Calloway. Afterward, Martins is asked to lecture at a book club a few days later. He then meets a friend of Lime\\'s, \"Baron\" Kurtz, who tells Martins that he and another friend, Popescu, carried Lime to the side of the street after the accident, and that, before he died, Lime asked them to take care of Martins and Lime\\'s girlfriend, actress Anna Schmidt. As Martins and Anna query Lime\\'s death, they realise that accounts differ as to whether Lime was able to speak before his death, and how many men carried away the body. The porter at Lime\\'s apartment tells them that he saw a third man helping. He offers to give Martins more information but is murdered before they can speak again; Martins and Anna flee the scene after a mob begins to suspect him of the murder. When Martins confronts Major Calloway and demands that Lime\\'s death be investigated, Calloway reveals that Lime was stealing penicillin from military hospitals, diluting it, and then selling it on the black market, injuring or killing countless people. Martins agrees to drop his investigation and leave. An inebriated Martins visits Anna and confesses his feelings for her. A man crosses the street towards her front door, but moves away after seeing Martins at the window. After leaving, Martins walks the streets until he notices Anna\\'s cat and realises someone is watching from a darkened doorway. In a momentary flash of light, Martins sees that the man is Lime. Martins calls out, but Lime flees and vanishes. Martins summons Calloway, who realises that Lime has escaped through the city\\'s sewers to the Soviet sector. The British police exhume Lime\\'s coffin and discover that the body is that of a hospital orderly who had been assisting him. Anna, who is Czech, is to be sent to the Soviet sector after the British police discover that she has a forged Austrian passport, and is questioned again by Calloway. Martins goes to Kurtz and asks to see Lime. They meet and talk as they ride the Wiener Riesenrad. Lime speaks cynically of the insignificance of his victims\\' lives and the personal gains to be earned from the city\\'s chaos and deprivation, further suggesting that he sold Anna out to the Soviet authorities in order to discourage them from pursuing him. He obliquely threatens Martins and taunts him for his infatuation with Anna before leaving quickly. Calloway asks Martins to help arrest Lime; he agrees provided that Calloway will arrange for Anna to leave Vienna rather than be handed over to the Soviets. The British authorities arrange for Anna to take a train to Paris, but she spots Martins, who has come to observe her departure, at the station. After persuading Martins to reveal the plan to capture Lime, she leaves in order to warn him. Exasperated, Martins decides to leave Vienna; on the way to the airport, Calloway stops at a hospital to show Martins children dying of meningitis who were treated with Lime\\'s diluted penicillin, which convinces him to stay and assist in capturing Lime. Lime arrives at a caf\u00e9 in the international zone to meet Martins, but Anna is able to warn him that the police are closing in. He flees into the sewer, with the police following him underground. Lime shoots and kills Sgt. Paine, but Calloway shoots and badly wounds Lime. Lime drags himself up a cast-iron stairway to a street grating but cannot lift it. Martins, armed with Paine\\'s gun, finds Lime beneath the grating and they exchange a look. Calloway shouts that Martins must take no chances and shoot on sight. Lime nods his head slightly at Martins, who then shoots and kills him. Martins attends Lime\\'s second funeral at the risk of missing his flight out of Vienna. He waits on the road to the cemetery to speak with Anna, but she walks past without glancing in his direction.",

            "plot": "In the late 1930s, the governor of an unnamed western state, Hubert Happy Hopper, appoints Jefferson Smith to replace deceased U.S. Senator Sam Foley. Smith is head of the Boy Rangers, and his appointment is supported by the governors children. Corrupt political boss Jim Taylor sought the appointment of his handpicked stooge, while popular committees wanted another candidate. Smith, however, was chosen because his naivety about politics was expected to make him easy to manipulate. Smith is taken under the wing of the publicly esteemed, but secretly crooked, Senator Joseph Paine, who was Smiths late fathers friend. Smith develops an immediate attraction to the senators daughter, Susan. At Senator Paines home, Smith has a conversation with Susan, fidgeting and bumbling, entranced by the young socialite. Smiths na\u00efve and honest nature allows the unforgiving Washington press to take advantage of him, quickly tarnishing Smiths reputation with ridiculous front-page pictures and headlines branding him a bumpkin. To keep Smith busy, Paine suggests he propose a bill. With the help of his secretary, Clarissa Saunders, who was the aide to Smiths predecessor and had been around Washington and politics for years, Smith comes up with a bill to authorize a federal government loan to buy some land in his home state for a national boys camp, to be paid back by youngsters across America. Donations pour in immediately. However, the proposed campsite is already part of a dam-building graft scheme included in an appropriations bill framed by the Taylor political machine and supported by Senator Paine. Unwilling to crucify the worshipful Smith so that their graft plan will go through, Paine tells Taylor he wants out, but Taylor reminds him that Paine is in power primarily through Taylors influence. Paine then advises Smith to keep silent about the matter. The following day, when Smith speaks out about the bill at Senate, the machine in his state \u2014 through Paine \u2014 accuses Smith of trying to profit from his bill by producing fraudulent evidence that Smith already owns the land in question. Smith is too shocked and angry by Paines betrayal to defend himself and runs away. Saunders, who looked down on Smith at first, but has come to believe in him, talks him into launching a filibuster to postpone the appropriations bill and prove his innocence on the Senate floor just before the vote to expel him. In his last chance to prove his innocence, he talks non-stop for about 25 hours, reaffirming the American ideals of freedom and disclosing the dam schemes true motives. Yet none of the senators are convinced. The constituents try to rally around him, but the entrenched opposition is too powerful, and all attempts are crushed. Owing to the influence of Taylors machine, newspapers and radio stations in Smiths home state, on Taylors orders, refuse to report what Smith has to say and even distort the facts against the senator. The Boy Rangers effort to spread the news in support of Smith results in vicious attacks on the children by Taylors gangsters. Although all hope seems lost, the senators begin to pay attention as Smith approaches utter exhaustion. Paine has one last card up his sleeve: he brings in bins of letters and telegrams from Smiths home state, purportedly from average people demanding his expulsion. Nearly broken by the news, Smith finds a small ray of hope in a friendly smile from the President of the Senate. Smith vows to press on until people believe him but immediately collapses in a faint. Overcome with the pangs of remorse, Paine leaves the Senate chamber and attempts to commit suicide by gunshot but is stopped by onlooking senators. He then bursts back into the Senate chamber, shouting a confession to the whole scheme; the reformed Paine further insists that he must be expelled from the Senate and affirms Smiths innocence to Clarissas delight. The President of the Senate observes the ensuing chaos with amusement.",

            "plot": "During the First World War, two French aviators of the Service A\u00e9ronautique, the aristocratic Captain de Bo\u00ebldieu and the working-class Lieutenant Mar\u00e9chal, set out to investigate a blurred spot found on reconnaissance photographs. They are shot down by German flying ace and aristocrat, Rittmeister von Rauffenstein, and both are taken prisoner by the Imperial German Army. Upon returning to the aerodrome, Rauffenstein sends a subordinate to find out if the aviators are officers and, if so, to invite them to lunch. During the meal, Rauffenstein and Bo\u00ebldieu discover they have mutual acquaintances\u2014a depiction of the familiarity, if not solidarity, within the upper classes that crosses national boundaries. Bo\u00ebldieu and Mar\u00e9chal are then taken to a prisoner-of-war camp, where they meet a colorful group of French prisoners and stage a vaudeville-type performance just after the Germans have taken Fort Douaumont in the epic Battle of Verdun. During the performance, word arrives that the French have recaptured the fort. Mar\u00e9chal interrupts the show, and the French prisoners spontaneously burst into La Marseillaise. As a result of the disruption, Mar\u00e9chal is placed in solitary confinement, where he suffers badly from lack of human contact and hunger; the fort changes hands once more while he is imprisoned. Bo\u00ebldieu and Mar\u00e9chal also help their fellow prisoners to finish digging an escape tunnel. However, just before it is completed, everyone is transferred to other camps. Because of the language barrier, Mar\u00e9chal is unable to pass word of the tunnel to an incoming British prisoner. Bo\u00ebldieu and Mar\u00e9chal are moved from camp to camp, finally arriving in Wintersborn, a mountain fortress prison commanded by Rauffenstein, who has been so badly injured in battle that he has been given a posting away from the front, much to his regret. Rauffenstein tells them that Wintersborn is escape-proof. At Wintersborn, the pair are reunited with a fellow prisoner, Rosenthal, from the original camp. Rosenthal is a wealthy French Jew who generously shares the food parcels he receives. Bo\u00ebldieu comes up with an idea, after carefully observing how the German guards respond to an emergency. He volunteers to distract the guards for the few minutes needed for Mar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal to escape. After a commotion staged by the prisoners, the guards are ordered to assemble them in the fortress courtyard. During the roll call, it is discovered that Bo\u00ebldieu is missing. He makes his presence known high up in the fortress, drawing the German guards away in pursuit. Mar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal take the opportunity to lower themselves from a window by a homemade rope and flee. Rauffenstein stops the guards from firing at Bo\u00ebldieu and pleads with his friend to give himself up. Bo\u00ebldieu refuses, and Rauffenstein reluctantly shoots him with his pistol, aiming for his legs but misses and accidentally and fatally hits him in the stomach. Nursed in his final moments by a grieving Rauffenstein, Bo\u00ebldieu laments that the whole purpose of the nobility and their usefulness to both French and German culture is being destroyed by the war. He expresses pity for von Rauffenstein, who will have to find a new purpose in the postwar world. Mar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal journey across the German countryside, trying to reach neutral Switzerland. Rosenthal injures his foot, slowing Mar\u00e9chal down. They quarrel and part, but then Mar\u00e9chal returns to help his comrade. They take refuge in the modest farmhouse of a German woman, Elsa, who lost her husband at Verdun, along with three brothers, at battles which, with quiet irony, she describes as our greatest victories. She takes them in and does not betray them to a passing army patrol. She and Mar\u00e9chal fall in love, despite not speaking each other\\'s language, but he and Rosenthal eventually leave from a sense of duty after Rosenthal recovers from his injury. Mar\u00e9chal declares he will come back to Elsa and her young daughter, Lotte, if he survives the war. A German patrol sights the two fugitives crossing a snow-covered valley. They fire a few rounds, but their commanding officer, hurrying to the scene, orders them to stop, saying the pair have crossed into Switzerland.",

            "plot": "Spoiled heiress Ellen Ellie Andrews has eloped with pilot and fortunehunter King Westley against the wishes of her extremely wealthy father, Alexander Andrews, who has sequestered his daughter and wants to have the marriage annulled because he knows that Westley is interested only in Ellies money. Jumping ship in Florida, Ellie runs away and boards a Greyhound bus to New York City to reunite with her husband. She meets fellow passenger Peter Warne, a newspaper reporter who recently lost his job. Soon, Peter recognizes her and gives her a choice. If she gives him an exclusive on her story, he will help her reach Westley. If not, he will tell her father where she is. Ellie agrees. Ellie loses her initial disdain for Peter and they begin to fall in love. When the bus breaks down, they try hitchhiking. They fail to secure a ride until Ellie displays a shapely leg to Danker, the next driver. When they stop en route, Danker tries to drive away with their luggage, but Peter chases him down and takes his Model T. Near the end of their journey, Ellie confesses her love to Peter. The owners of the motel in which they are staying notice that Peters car is gone and expel Ellie. Believing Peter has deserted her, Ellie telephones her father, who agrees to let her marry Westley. Meanwhile, Peter has obtained money from his editor to marry Ellie but he misses her on the road. Although Ellie has no desire to be with Westley, she believes that Peter has betrayed her for the reward money and so agrees to have a second, formal wedding with Westley. On the wedding day, she finally reveals the whole story to her father. When Peter comes to Ellies home, Andrews offers him the reward money, but Peter insists on being paid only his expenses, a mere 39.60 for items that he had been forced to sell to buy gasoline. When Andrews presses Peter for an explanation of his odd behavior and demands to know if he loves her, Peter first tries to dodge the questions but then admits that he does and storms out. Westley arrives via an autogyro, but at the ceremony, Andrews reveals to his daughter Peters refusal of the reward money and tells her that her car is waiting by the back gate in case she changes her mind. At the last minute, Ellie dumps Westley at the altar, bolts for her car, and drives away as the newsreel cameras crank. A few days later, Andrews is working at his desk when Westley calls to tell him that he will take the financial settlement and not contest the annulment. His executive assistant brings him a telegram from Peter: Whats holding up the annulment, you slowpoke? The walls of Jericho are toppling! That is a reference to a makeshift wall made of a blanket hung over a rope that was tied across the rooms separating the beds they had slept in, in order to give them each privacy while traveling together. With the annulment in hand, Andrews sends the reply, Let em topple. Peters battered Model T is parked in a motor court in Glen Falls, Michigan. The momandpop owners talk and wonder why, on such a warm night, the newlyweds he had seen the marriage license wanted a clothesline, an extra blanket, and a little tin trumpet. As they look at the cabin, the toy trumpet sounds a fanfare, the blanket falls to the floor, and the lights in the cabin go out.",

She whistles from the fence outside. The Man is torn, but finally departs, leaving his wife with the memories of better times when they were deeply in love. The man and woman meet in the moonlight and kiss passionately. She wants him to sell his farm\u2014which has not done well recently\u2014to join her in the city. When she suggests that he solve the problem of his wife by drowning her, he throttles her violently, but even that dissolves in a passionate embrace. The Woman gathers bundles of reeds so that when the boat is overturned, the Man can stay afloat. The Wife suspects nothing when her husband suggests going on an outing, but when they set off across the lake, she soon grows suspicious. He prepares to throw her overboard, but when she pleads for his mercy, he realizes he cannot do it. He rows frantically for shore, and when the boat reaches land, the Wife flees. She boards a trolley, and he follows, begging her not to be afraid of him. The trolley brings them to the city. Her fear and disappointment are overwhelming. He plies her with flowers and bread and finally she stops crying and accepts his gifts. Emerging back on the street, they are touched to see a bride enter a church for her processional, and follow her inside to watch the wedding. The Man breaks down and asks her to forgive him. After a tearful reconciliation, they continue their adventure in the city, having their photograph taken together and visiting a funfair. As darkness falls, they board the trolley for home. Soon they are drifting back across the lake under the moonlight. A sudden storm causes their boat to begin sinking. The Man remembers the two bundles of reeds he placed in the boat earlier and ties the bundles around the Wife. The boat capsizes, and the Man awakes on a rocky shore. He gathers the townspeople to search the lake, but all they find is a broken bundle of reeds floating in the water. Convinced the Wife has drowned, the grief-stricken Man stumbles home. The Woman from the City goes to his house, assuming their plan has succeeded. The Man begins to choke her. Then the Maid calls to him that his wife is alive, so he releases the Woman and runs to the Wife, who survived by clinging to one last bundle of reeds. The Man kneels by the Wife\\'s bed as she slowly opens her eyes. The Man and the Wife kiss, while the Woman from the city\\'s carriage rolls down the hill toward the lake, and the film dissolves to the sunrise.",

After a hard day at work, Mias next audition goes awry because the casting director takes a phone call during an emotional scene. That night, her roommates take her to a lavish party in the Hollywood Hills, promising her that someone in the crowd could jump-start her career. After her car is towed, she walks home in disappointment. During a gig at a restaurant, Seb slips into jazz improvisation despite the owners warning to only play traditional Christmas pieces. Mia hears him playing as she passes by. Moved, she enters the restaurant and observes Seb being fired for disobedience. Mia attempts to compliment him as he storms out, but he brushes by her. Months later, she runs into Seb at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band. Mia makes Seb play I Ran for her. After the gig, they walk to their cars and lament wasting a lovely night together despite their clear chemistry. Seb arrives at Mias workplace, and she shows him around the Warner Bros backlot, where she works as a barista, while expressing her passion for acting. He takes her to a jazz club, describing his passion for jazz and his desire to open his own club. Seb invites Mia to a screening of Rebel Without a Cause and she accepts, forgetting a date with her boyfriend. Bored with the latter date, she rushes to the theater and finds Seb as the film begins. When the screening is interrupted by a projector malfunction, Seb and Mia spend the rest of the evening together with a romantic visit to the Griffith Observatory. After more failed auditions, Mia decides, with Sebs encouragement, to write a one-woman play. Seb begins to perform regularly at a jazz club, and the two of them eventually move in together. A former bandmate of Seb invites him to be the keyboardist in a new jazz fusion band, which will give him a steady income. Although dismayed by the bands pop style, Seb signs on after hearing Mia trying to convince her mother that he is working on his career. The band finds success, but Mia knows their music is not the type of music Seb wants to perform. During the bands first tour, Seb and Mia argue: she accuses him of abandoning his dreams, while he claims that she liked him more when he was unsuccessful because it made her feel better about herself. Two weeks later, Seb misses Mias play because of a photoshoot he had forgotten about. The play fails, very few people attend, and Mia overhears dismissive comments about her performance. Unable to forgive him for missing her play and their previous argument, Mia returns to her hometown of Boulder City, Nevada. Seb receives a phone call from a prominent casting director who attended Mias play, inviting her to audition for an upcoming film. Knowing that this could be her big break, he drives in a hurry to Boulder City. He finds her house since he remembered that she lived across the street from the library, the library where she fell in love with acting. Seb persuades her to attend, and she reluctantly agrees to go. The next morning, Seb picks her up, and Mia greets him with a coffee. During the audition, Mia is asked to tell a story. In response, she talks about how her aunt, a one-time stage actress who eventually died from alcoholism, inspired her to chase her dreams. Confident the audition was a success, Seb encourages Mia to devote herself to acting. The two then recognize that they will always love each other despite what may come for their relationship. Five years later, Mia is a famous actress and married to a different man, with whom she has a daughter. She is living a happy life. That night, the couple stumble upon a jazz bar. Recognizing the logo she had once designed, Mia realizes that Seb has opened his own jazz club. Seb notices Mia in the crowd and begins to play their love theme on the piano. The two imagine what might have been had their relationship thrived along with their careers before acknowledging each other with a silent exchange of smiles and going their separate ways.",

When Grace finds out she is pregnant, she schedules an appointment for an abortion; she eventually tells Mason about the pregnancy; he is overjoyed. She does not tell him she plans to have an abortion. At their facility, Grace and Mason focus their efforts on Marcus, a resident who is about to turn 18 and is struggling with the prospect of leaving the facility. Grace bonds with Jayden, a recent arrival at Short Term 12 who has a history of self-harm. Jayden distances herself from the other teenagers, as she does not intend to stay at the facility for long. When her father fails to pick her up on her birthday, she reacts violently toward the staff. After her outburst, she sits in the cool-down room with Grace, who shows Jayden her own scars from cutting herself. That night, Jayden leaves the facility in the middle of her birthday celebrations. Unable to force her to return, Grace follows Jayden to her fathers house. After finding the house empty, they return to Short Term 12. When Jayden reads Grace a cryptic story she has written, Grace begins to suspect that Jayden was abused by her father. At a party hosted by Masons foster parents, he proposes to Grace, who accepts. The following morning, Grace is upset by a phone call that reveals her father is being released from prison. She refuses to be consoled by Mason. She arrives at Short Term 12 to discover that Jayden has been picked up by her father overnight. She is angry at the decision to send Jayden back to her father, but her boss maintains that Jayden denied that she was abused by him. Later that day, Grace finds that Marcus has attempted to commit suicide after the death of his fish. While waiting at the hospital as Marcus is being treated, Grace breaks down. Mason becomes upset for her refusing to talk to him about how she feels; instead, she tells him that she no longer wants to marry him and that she plans to have an abortion. She returns to Jaydens fathers house and breaks in, intending to kill him while he sleeps, but she is interrupted by Jayden, who suggests that they smash his car instead. Grace tells Jayden that she was sexually abused by her own father. After Jayden shows Grace bruises from blows by her father, they return together to Short Term 12, where Jayden reports her father for physical abuse. Grace goes home to apologize to Mason, who tells her that Marcus will recover. Several weeks later, Grace starts seeing a therapist. She is shown viewing an ultrasound of her fetus with Mason.

            "plot": "In 1951, police investigate the mathematician Alan Turing after an apparent home break-in. During his interrogation, Turing talks of his work at Bletchley Park during WWII.In 1928, the young Turing is constantly bullied at boarding school. Developing a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks his interest in cryptography, he soon develops romantic feelings. However, Christopher shortly dies from tuberculosis.When Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing joins the cryptography team of Conel Hugh ODonel AlexanderHugh Alexander, John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman, and Charles Richards in Bletchley Park, directed by Commander Alastair Denniston. They are to analyze the Enigma machine, which the Nazis use to send coded messages.Difficult to work with, and believing his colleagues inferior, Turing works alone to design a machine to decipher Enigma messages. When Denniston refuses to fund the machines 100000 construction cost, Turing contacts Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who makes him team leader and funds them. Turing fires Furman and Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers to find replacements.Cambridge graduate Joan Clarke passes Turings test but her family will not allow her to work with the male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her to live and work with the women who intercept the messages, and shares his plans with her. Clarke helps Turing warm to the others, who begin to respect him.Turings machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed but cannot determine the Enigma encryption settings quickly enough; as the Germans reset them each day. Denniston orders it to be destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes.When Clarke plans to leave because of her parents, Turing proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their engagement party, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who advises he keep secret.Overhearing a clerk talking about messages she receives from the same German coder and always contain the same combination of letters at the beginning, Turing has an epiphany: he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages. They realize that the answer to the daily code combination is in the 600am weather forecast, and that all telegrams contain the same phrase Heil Hitler, which reveals enough of the days Enigma code for Christopher to quickly decode all the messages that same day. Recalibrating the machine, it quickly decodes a message, and the cryptographers celebrate.Discovering a British convoy is about to be attacked, Turing realizes that if they suddenly react to prevent it, the Germans will know Enigma is compromised and change it. Therefore, the team cannot act on every decoded message, so they do not act to save the convoy although Peter begs them, as his brother serves on one of the ships. Turing asks Chief of MI6 Stewart Menzies to keep this discovery a secret, and in return promises to create a statistical model to choose the warnings to send to maximize destruction and minimize detection.Discovering Cairncross is a Soviet spy, Turing confronts him. Cairncross argues that the Soviets are allies, working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by disclosing Turings sexuality if he divulges his identity. When Menzies threatens to have Clarke arrested as a suspected spy, Turing reveals that the spy is actually Cairncross. Menzies reveals that he already knew, and he had put Cairncross in the team so he could choose exactly what information to leak to the Soviets for British benefit.Turing urges Clarke to leave Bletchley Park and terminate their engagement, telling her he is a homosexual. She reacts calmly, saying she always suspected but insists they would have been happy together anyway, as she never expected them to have a normal marriage like most couples. Fearing for her safety, Turing says he never cared for her, and only used her for her cryptography skills. Although heartbroken, Clarke stays on, knowing how important their task is. She refuses to bow down to what Turing or her parents want her to do, or what they think of her decisions.After the war, Menzies has the cryptographers destroy the evidence, as MI6 wants governments to believe they have unbreakable code machines. The team should never meet again or share what they have done.In 1952, Turing is convicted of gross indecency and chooses to undergo chemical castration instead of going to prison, so he can continue his work. Clarke visits him, witnesses his physical and mental deterioration, and tries to comfort him that he has saved countless lives and made the world an infinitely better place.The epilogue shows Turing committed suicide on June 7, 1954, after a year of government-mandated hormonal therapy. In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous Royal Pardon. Historians estimate that breaking Enigma shortened the war by over two years, saving over 14 million lives; and Turings work was an important step towards todays computers.",

            "plot": "In 2049, 30 years after the events of Blade Runner, bioengineered humans known as replicants are still used for slave labor. K (short for serial number, KD6-3.7), a Nexus-9 replicant, works for the Los Angeles Police Department as a blade runner, an officer who hunts and retires (kills) rogue replicant models. After retiring replicant Sapper Morton, K finds a box buried under a tree at Mortons farm. It contained the remains of a female replicant who died during a caesarean section. This demonstrates that replicants could reproduce biologically, previously thought impossible. Ks superior, Lt. Joshi, fears this knowledge could lead to war between humans and replicants, so she orders K to retire the replicant child. K visits the Wallace Corporation, successor to the defunct Tyrell Corporation in the manufacture of replicants. DNA archives identify the deceased female as Rachael, an experimental Nexus 7 replicant. K learns of Racheals romantic ties with former blade runner Rick Deckard. CEO Niander Wallace wants the secret to replicant reproduction to expand interstellar colonization. He sends his replicant enforcer, Luv, to monitor K. At Mortons farm, K finds the date 6.10.21 carved into the tree trunk and recognizes it from a childhood memory of a wooden toy horse. Because replicant memories are artificial, Ks holographic AI girlfriend Joi believes this is evidence that K was born, not created. K discovers in LAPD records two children born on that date with identical DNA aside from the sex chromosome, but only the boy is listed as alive. K tracks the child to an orphanage but the records from that year are missing. K recognizes the orphanage from his memories and finds the toy horse in the furnace where he remembers hiding it. Replicant memory designer Dr. Ana Stelline confirms that his memory of the orphanage is authentic, leading K to conclude he is Racheals son. K then fails a baseline test, marking him as rogue. When he implies to Joshi that he killed the replicant child, she gives him 48 hours to pass the test, or he will be retired. Joi hires replicant prostitute Mariette as a surrogate for her to have sex with K. The following morning, Mariette places a tracker on Ks jacket prior to being sent away by a jealous Joi. Analysis of the toy horse leads K to the ruins of a radioactive Las Vegas. There he finds Deckard, who informs him he is the father of Racheals child and scrambled the birth records to protect their offspring\u2019s identity. Deckard left the child in the custody of the replicant freedom movement. Luv kills Joshi and tracks K to Las Vegas. She kidnaps Deckard, destroys Joi, and leaves a weakened K behind. Using Mariettes tracker, the replicant freedom movement rescues K. When their leader, Freysa, discloses to him that Racheals child was a girl, K deduces that Stelline is her daughter and that the toy horse memory is hers. Fearing Deckard may give up Stelline or the freedom movement to Wallace, Freysa urges K to kill him. Luv takes Deckard to meet Wallace, who offers Deckard a duplicate Rachael in exchange for information about his childs whereabouts. He refuses, so Luv kills the duplicate. As Luv transports Deckard to be tortured Off-World, K intercedes. He fights and drowns Luv to death but is severely wounded in the process. K stages Deckards death to protect him from Wallace and the replicant freedom movement before taking Deckard to Stellines office and handing him her toy horse. As K dies on the steps looking up at the falling snow, Deckard enters the building and tearfully meets his daughter for the first time.In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Blade Runner 2049 screenwriter Michael Green confirmed that K dies as he lies on the steps.",

            "plot": "At the official closing of the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium, Prince Albert Bertie, Duke of York, the second son of King George V, addresses the crowd with a strong stammer. His search for treatment has been discouraging, but his wife, Elizabeth, persuades him to see Australianborn Lionel Logue, a nonmedically trained Harley Street speech defects therapist. Bertie believes the first session is not going well, but Lionel has him recite Hamlets To be, or not to be soliloquy while listening to classical music over a pair of headphones. Bertie is frustrated but Lionel gives him the acetate recording that he has made of the reading as a souvenir. After Berties father, King George V, broadcasts his 1934 Royal Christmas Message, he explains to Bertie that the wireless will play a significant part in the role of the royal family, allowing them to enter the homes of the people, and that Berties brothers neglect of his responsibilities makes training in it necessary. The attempt at reading the message himself is a failure, but Bertie plays the recording Lionel gave him that night and is astonished at the lack of stutter. He returns for daily treatments to overcome the physical and psychological roots of his stutter. George V dies in 1936. His eldest son David ascends the throne as King Edward VIII. A constitutional crisis arises with Edward over a prospective marriage with twicedivorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. Edward, as the supreme governor of the Church of England, cannot marry her, even if her second divorce occurs, since both her previous husbands are alive. At an unscheduled session, Bertie expresses frustration that, while his speech has mostly improved, he still stammers when talking to David, simultaneously revealing the extent of Edward VIIIs folly with Simpson. When Lionel insists that Bertie himself could make a good king, Bertie accuses Lionel of treason and angrily quits Lionel. They reconvene after King Edward decides to abdicate to marry. Bertie, urged by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, ascends the throne as King George VI and visits Lionels home with his wife before their coronation, much to the surprise of Mrs. Logue when she learns who Lionels client has been. Berties and Lionels relationship is questioned by the Kings advisors during preparations for his coronation in Westminster Abbey. The archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Gordon Lang, points out that George never sought advice from his advisors about his treatment and that Lionel lacks formal training. Lionel explains to an outraged Bertie that at the time he started with speech defects there were no formal qualifications and that the only known help that was available for returning Great War shellshocked Australian soldiers was from personal experience. Bertie remains unconvinced until provoked to protest at Lionels disrespect for King Edwards Chair and the Stone of Scone. After realising he has just expressed himself without impairment, Bertie is able to rehearse with Lionel and complete the ceremony. As king, Bertie has a crisis when he must broadcast to Britain and the Empire following the declaration of war on Nazi Germany in 1939. Lionel is summoned to Buckingham Palace to prepare the king for his speech. Knowing the challenge that lies before him, Lang, Winston Churchill, and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain accompany for support. Bertie and Logue are left in the broadcasting room. He delivers his speech with Logue conducting him, but eventually begins speaking freely. Logue mentions that Bertie still struggles enunciating w, to which Bertie replies, I had to throw in a few so theyd know it was me. As the Royal Family step onto the palace balcony and are applauded by the crowd, a title card explains that Logue, who was made Commander of the Royal Victorian Order for services to the Crown, was always present at King George VIs speeches during the war and that they remained friends until the Kings death from lung cancer in 1952.",

            "plot": "In 2006, 18-year-old Jamal Malik, a resident of the Juhu slum of Mumbai, is a contestant on Kaun Banega Crorepati. Before answering the final INR2 crore question, he is detained and tortured by the police, who suspect him of cheating. Through a series of flashbacks, he recounts the incidents in his life that provided him with each answer.In 1992, five-year-old Jamal obtains the autograph of Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan after jumping into a cesspit. Jamal\\'s elder brother Salim later sells the autograph. Their mother is killed during the Bombay riots. While fleeing the riot, the brothers briefly encounter a child dressed up as Rama, with a bow and arrow in their right hand. Having escaped the riots and taken shelter from the rain, the brothers meet Latika, a girl from their slum. Salim is reluctant to take her in, but Jamal suggests that she could be their third musketeer, a reference to the Alexandre Dumas novel The Three Musketeers which the brothers had learned about in school. The brothers refer to themselves as Athos and Porthos but do not know the third musketeer\\'s name.The three children are found by Maman\u2014a gangster who trains street children to become beggars. After learning that Maman is blinding the children to make them more effective beggars, Salim escapes with Jamal and Latika. The brothers successfully board a moving train, but Latika is unable to keep up. Salim grabs her hand but purposefully lets go as revenge for pulling a prank on him, leaving her to be recaptured by Maman. For the next few years, Salim and Jamal travel on top of trains, making a living by selling goods, pickpocketing, washing dishes, and pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal. At Jamal\\'s insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika and discover that Maman is raising her to be a prostitute. The brothers rescue her, Salim shooting Maman dead. Salim gets a job with Javed\u2014a rival crime lord. In their room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him alone with Latika, presumably to sexually assault her. When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him, and Latika persuades Jamal to leave.In 2004, Jamal, now working as a chaiwala in a call centre, learns that Salim is a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed\\'s crime organisation. Jamal confronts Salim, who pleads for forgiveness. Jamal then sneaks into Javed\\'s residence and reunites with Latika. Although he professes his love for her, she tells him to forget her. Despite the refusal, Jamal promises to wait for her every day at five o\\'clock at Victoria Terminus. Attempting to meet him there, Latika is captured by Javed\\'s men, led by Salim. He scars her face while driving away. Jamal loses contact with Latika and in a final attempt to reach her, he becomes a contestant on Kaun Banega Crorepati, knowing she watches the show.Jamal plays extremely well and becomes popular across India, much to the dismay of the show\\'s host, Prem Kumar. Kumar attempts to trick Jamal by feeding him the wrong answer to the penultimate question. However, Jamal answers correctly, raising suspicion of him cheating.When the episode ends, Jamal is arrested. After an initial beating, the police inspector listens to his explanation of how he knew each answer. The officer believes Jamal and allows him to return to the show. Latika sees that Jamal was arrested on the news. Feeling guilty about his past behaviour, Salim gives Latika his phone and car keys, asking her to forgive him. After Latika leaves, Salim fills a bathtub with money and sits in it, waiting for Javed to realise what happened.For the final question, Jamal is asked the name of the third musketeer. Jamal admits to not knowing the answer and uses his Phone-A-Friend lifeline to call Salim because it is the only phone number he knows. Latika answers and tells Jamal that she is safe, but does not know the answer. Javed hears Latika on the show and realises that Salim betrayed him. He and his men break down the bathroom door. Salim kills Javed before getting shot and killed by the gang. Relieved about Latika, Jamal guesses and picks the first answer, Aramis. He is correct and wins the grand prize. Jamal and Latika meet on the platform at the train station, kiss, and dance to the song Jai Ho along with all the other characters.",

            "plot": "In 1985, promiscuous Dallas electrician and rodeo cowboy Ron Woodroof is diagnosed with HIVAIDS and told that he has about 30 days to live. At first, he refuses to accept the diagnosis until he remembers having unprotected sex with a prostitute who was an intravenous drug user. Woodroofs family and friends ostracize him, mistakenly assuming he contracted AIDS from gay sex. He is fired from his job and evicted from his home. His doctor, Eve Saks, tells him an antiretroviral drug called zidovudine AZTthe only drug yet approved for testing in human clinical trials by the FDAis thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients. Saks informs him that half of the trial patients receive the drug and the other half a placebo since this is the only way to determine if the drug works. Woodroof bribes a hospital worker to get him AZT, which, exacerbated by his cocaine and alcohol abuse, causes his health to deteriorate. Recuperating in the hospital, he meets Rayon, a drugaddicted, HIVpositive trans woman he is initially hostile toward. As his health worsens, he drives to a makeshift Mexican hospital to get more AZT. The facility is run by an American, Dr. Vass, whose medical license was revoked because his work with people with AIDS had violated US regulations. Vass warns Woodroof against AZT, telling him it is poisonous. Instead, he prescribes a cocktail of drugs and nutritional supplements centered on ddCand the protein peptide T, which are not yet approved for use in the United States by the FDA. Three months later, Woodroof finds his health much improved and realizes he could make money by importing the drugs and selling them to other HIVpositive patients. He is able to get the drugs over the border by masquerading as a priest with cancer and claiming they are for personal use. Dr. Saks starts to notice the adverse effects of AZT, but her supervisor, Dr. Sevard, tells her the trials cannot be discontinued. Woodroof starts selling the drugs in Dallas on the street, at gay nightclubs, and discotheque bars. He reluctantly partners with Rayon since she can bring in more customers. The pair establishes the Dallas Buyers Club, charging 400 per month for membership and giving away the drugs to members to circumvent the laws that made it illegal to sell the drugs. The club is extremely popular, and Woodroof gradually begins to respect Rayon as a friend. When Woodroof is hospitalized for a heart attack caused by an overdose of recently acquired interferon from Japan, Dr. Sevard learns of the club and its alternative drugs and is angry that the buyers club is interfering with his trial. The FDA confiscates the interferon and threatens to have Woodroof arrested. Dr. Saks agrees that there are benefits to clubs for HIV drugs but feels powerless to change anything. The process the FDA uses to research, test, and approve drugs is considered flawed and part of the problem for people suffering from AIDS. At that time, the United States and the FDA were particularly conservative by international standards in testing and approving antiAIDS drugs. They were hostile to imported drugs to the point they were made contraband. Dr. Saks and Woodroof begin a friendship. The FDA gets a warrant to raid the Buyers Club but can do nothing but fine Woodroof. The FDA changes its regulations in 1987, making any unapproved drug illegal. With the club strapped for cash, Rayon begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico to get more peptide T. Upon his return, he finds that Rayon has died in the hospital and is extremely upset by her death. Dr. Saks is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she has been sending patients to the buyers club, but she refuses and insists they will have to fire her instead. After Rayons death, Woodroof begins to show more compassion toward LGBT members of the club, and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority becomes providing the drugs as peptide T gets increasingly challenging to acquire. Woodroof files a lawsuit against the FDA in late 1987, seeking the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as nontoxic but is still not FDAapproved. The judge is sympathetic toward him and admonishes the FDA but lacks the power to do anything. The FDA later allows Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use. He dies of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially had predicted.",

            "plot": "In 1981, San Francisco salesman Chris Gardner invests his entire life savings in portable bone-density scanners, which he demonstrates to doctors and pitches as a handy improvement over standard X-rays. The scanners play a vital role in Chris life. While he can sell most of them, the time lag between the sales and his growing financial demands enrages his bitter and estranged wife, Linda, who works as a hotel maid. The economic instability increasingly erodes their marriage, despite caring for Christopher Jr, their soon-to-be 5-year-old son. While Chris tries to sell one of the scanners, he meets Jay Twistle, a lead manager and partner for Dean Witter Reynolds and impresses him by solving a Rubiks Cube during a taxi ride. After Jay leaves, Chris skips out on paying the fare, causing the driver to angrily chase him into a BART station, he is forced to leave. However, Chris new relationship with Jay earns him an interview to become an intern stockbroker. The day before the interview, Chris grudgingly agrees to paint his apartment for free to postpone eviction by his landlord for late rent. While painting, Chris is greeted by two policemen at his doorstep, who arrest him for failure to pay multiple parking tickets. Chris has to spend the night in jail, complicating his schedule for the interview the next day. Chris narrowly arrives at Dean Witters office on time, albeit still in shabby, paint-spattered clothes. Despite his appearance, Chris still impresses the interviewers and lands a six-month unpaid internship. He is among 20 interns competing for a paid position as a stockbroker. A possible position at her sisters boyfriends restaurant tempts Linda to leave for New York. With regret, she leaves Christopher in Chris care. However, Chris financial problems worsen when his already diminished bank account is garnished by the IRS for unpaid income taxes, and his landlord finally evicts him and Christopher. With only 2133 in his bank account, Chris and Christopher are left homeless and desperate, Chris is able to get food and beds at the local shelter, and eventually scraps together cash for a motel room, but the locks are then changed when he cant pay on time, he is then forced to live out of the restrooms in local BART stations with his son. Later, Chris finds the scanner that he lost in the station earlier. He sells his blood to pay for repairs and then gets a local physician to purchase it, thereby freeing himself to focus solely on his stockbroker training. Disadvantaged by his limited work hours and knowing that maximizing his client contacts and profits is the only way to earn the broker position, Chris develops several ways to make sales calls more efficiently, including reaching out to potential high-value customers in person, a violation of firm protocol. One sympathetic prospect, Walter Ribbon, a top-level pension fund manager, even takes Chris and Christopher to a San Francisco 49ers game, where Chris befriends some of Mr Ribbons friends, who are also potential clients. Regardless of his challenges, Chris never reveals his lowly circumstances to his colleagues, even going so far as to lend one of his supervisors, Mr Frohm, the last five dollars in his wallet for cab fare. He also studies for and aces the stockbroker license exam. As Chris concludes his last day of internship, he is summoned to a meeting with the partners. Mr Frohm notes that Chris is wearing a nice shirt, to which Chris explains he thought it appropriate to dress for the occasion on his last day. Mr Frohm thanks him and says Chris should wear another one the following day, letting Chris know that he has won the coveted full-time position and reimburses Chris for the previous cab ride. Fighting back tears, he shakes hands with the partners, then rushes to Christophers daycare to embrace him. They walk down a street and joke with each other and are passed by the real Chris Gardner, in a business suit. An epilogue reveals that Gardner went on to form his own multimillion-dollar brokerage firm in 1987, and Gardner sold a minority stake in his brokerage firm in a multi-million-dollar deal in 2006.",

            "plot": "In 1999, Sierra Leone is ravaged by civil war. The Revolutionary United Front terrorizes the countryside and enslaves many locals to harvest diamonds, which fund their increasingly successful war effort. Solomon Vandy, a Mende fisherman from Shenge, is separated from his family and assigned to a workforce overseen by Captain Poison, a ruthless warlord. While mining a river, Vandy discovers an enormous pink diamond. Captain Poison tries to take the stone, but the area is suddenly raided by government troops. Vandy buries the stone before being captured. Vandy and Poison are incarcerated in Freetown along with Danny Archer, a white Rhodesian gunrunner and Border War veteran jailed for trying to smuggle diamonds into Liberia. The diamonds were intended for Rudolph van de Kaap, a corrupt South African mining executive. Hearing of the pink diamond in prison, Archer arranges for himself and Vandy to be freed. He travels to Cape Town to meet his employer: Colonel Coetzee, an Afrikaner formerly with the apartheid-era South African Defence Force whom Archer also served under in the 32 Battalion, who now commands a private military company. Archer wants the diamond so he can sell it to van de Kaap and retire, but Coetzee wants it as compensation for Archers botched smuggling mission. Archer returns to Sierra Leone, locates Vandy, and offers to help him find his family if he will help recover the diamond. The RUF conquers Freetown, while Vandy\\'s son Dia is captured to serve as a child soldier under a liberated Captain Poison. Archer and Vandy narrowly escape to Lungi, where they plan to reach Kono with the help of an American journalist, Maddy Bowen, in exchange for Archer providing evidence of the illicit diamond trade. Maddy helps Vandy locate his remaining family at a refugee camp in Guinea. Eventually, the trio arrive in Kono after a harrowing journey, where Coetzee and his private army \u2014 contracted by the Sierra Leone government \u2014 prepares to repulse the rebel offensive. While Maddy gets out with her story, the two men set out for Captain Poison\\'s encampment. Dia, stationed with the RUF garrison there, is confronted by Vandy, but having been brainwashed he refuses to acknowledge his father. Archer radios the sites coordinates to Coetzee, who directs a combined air and ground assault on the camp. Vandy finds Captain Poison and beats him to death with a shovel as the mercenaries overwhelm the RUF defenders. Coetzee then forces Vandy to produce the diamond, but is killed by Archer, who realizes Coetzee would eventually kill them both. Dia briefly holds the pair at gunpoint, but Vandy confronts him again and renews their familial bond. Pursued by vengeful mercenaries, Archer discloses he has been mortally wounded and entrusts the stone to Vandy, telling him to take it for his family. Vandy and his son rendezvous with Archer\\'s pilot, who flies them to safety while Archer makes a final phone call to Maddy; they share final farewells as he asks her to assist Vandy, and gives her permission to finish her article. Archer finally takes in the beautiful African landscape before dying. Vandy arrives in London and meets with a van de Kaap representative; he exchanges the pink diamond for a large sum of money and being reunited with his entire family. Maddy takes photographs of the deal to publish in her article on the diamond trade, exposing van de Kaap\\'s criminal actions. Vandy appears as a guest speaker at a conference on blood diamonds in Kimberley, and is met with a standing ovation.",

            "plot": "James J. Braddock is an Irish-American boxer from New Jersey, formerly a light heavyweight contender, who is forced to give up boxing after breaking his hand in the ring. This is both a relief and a burden to his wife, Mae. She cannot bring herself to watch the violence of his chosen profession, yet she knows they will not have enough income without his boxing. As the United States enters the Great Depression, Braddock does manual labor as a longshoreman to support his family, even with his injured hand. Unfortunately, he cannot get work every day. Thanks to a last-minute cancellation by another boxer, Braddocks longtime manager and friend, Joe Gould, offers him a chance to fill in for just one night and earn cash. The fight is against the number-two contender in the world, Corn Griffin. Braddock stuns the boxing experts and fans with a third-round knockout of his formidable opponent. He believes that while his right hand was broken, he became more proficient with his left hand, improving his in-ring ability. Despite Maes objections, Braddock takes up Goulds offer to return to the ring. Mae resents this attempt by Gould to profit from her husbands dangerous livelihood, until she discovers that Gould and his wife also have been devastated by hard times. With a shot at the heavyweight championship held by Max Baer a possibility, Braddock continues to win. Out of a sense of pride, he uses a portion of his prize money to pay back money to the government given to him while unemployed. When his rags to riches story gets out, the sportswriter Damon Runyon dubs him The Cinderella Man, and before long Braddock comes to represent the hopes and aspirations of the American public struggling with the Depression. After wins against John Henry Lewis and Art Lasky, a title fight against Baer comes his way. Braddock is a 10to1 underdog. Baer is so destructive that the fights promoter, James Johnston, forces both Braddock and Gould to watch a film of Baer in action, just so he can maintain later that he warned them what Braddock was up against, as Baer had reportedly killed 2 men in the ring. Braddock demonstrates no fear. The arrogant Baer attempts to intimidate him, even taunting Mae in public that her man might not survive. When he says this, she becomes so angry that she throws a drink at him. She is unable to attend the fight at the Madison Square Garden Bowl or even to listen to it on the radio. On June 13, 1935, in one of the greatest upsets in boxing history, Braddock defeats the seemingly invincible Baer to become the heavyweight champion of the world. An epilogue reveals that Braddock would lose his title to Joe Louis who would later call Braddock the most courageous man I ever fought and later worked on the building of the Verrazzano Bridge, owning and operating heavy machinery on the docks where he worked during the Depression, and that he and Mae used his boxing income to buy a house, where they spent the rest of their lives.",

            "plot": "In the early 18th century, Governor Weatherby Swann and his daughter, Elizabeth, sail aboard HMS Dauntless with Lieutenant Norrington and his crew. They recover a shipwreck survivor, a boy named Will Turner. Elizabeth takes a gold medallion from around Wills neck, before seeing a ship with black sails. Eight years later in Port Royal, Jamaica, Norrington is promoted to commodore. While the promotion ceremony is taking place, the pirate captain Jack Sparrow arrives in Port Royal. After the ceremony, Norrington proposes to Elizabeth. Due to her tightfitting corset, she faints and falls into the ocean, which causes the medallion she is carrying to emit a pulse. Jack rescues Elizabeth before escaping from Norrington, who has identified him as a pirate. Will encounters Jack and duels him until Jack is captured and imprisoned. That night, Port Royal is attacked by the pirate crew of the Black Pearl, the ship Elizabeth saw years earlier. The pirates are searching for the medallion, and take Elizabeth aboard the ship to meet Captain Barbossa. He explains that the medallion is one of 882 gold pieces used to bribe Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s to stop his slaughter of the Aztecs. Because of Cort\u00e9ss greed, the Aztec gods placed a curse upon the gold. Barbossas crew found the gold at Isla de Muerta, but after spending it, they became immortal zombies. To lift the curse, the crew must return all the gold with an offering of blood from each member. The only member whose blood hasnt been paid yet is Bootstrap Bill, who was lost to the sea. Barbossa intends to use Elizabeths blood for the ritual, as he believes her to be Bootstraps child that he gave the last gold piece to. To save Elizabeth, Will frees Jack from prison. They stage an attempt to steal the Dauntless, which prompts Norrington and his crew to pursue them on HMS Interceptor. Jack and Will then sneak onto the Interceptor and escape. They head to Tortuga to find Joshamee Gibbs and recruit a crew. On Isla de Muerta, Jack and Will creep into the treasure grotto, where Barbossa fails to lift the curse with Elizabeths blood. Will and Elizabeth flee with one of the medallions on the Interceptor, while Jack is captured by Barbossa and locked up aboard the Pearl. A battle ensues between the Pearl and the Interceptor. Will realizes that Barbossa needs his blood for the rite, because Bootstrap was his father, and he surrenders himself to ensure Elizabeths freedom. Barbossa destroys the Interceptor, takes its crew prisoner, then deposits Jack and Elizabeth on a deserted island. Elizabeth creates a smoke signal, which allows the Navy to find and rescue them. Elizabeth then accepts Norringtons marriage proposal on the condition that he rescue Will from Barbossa. That night, Jack and Norrington make a plan to ambush the pirates at Isla de Muerta. Norrington, however, plans to attack the pirates himself, and Jack convinces Barbossa to refrain from lifting the curse until after they have killed Norringtons men. Having anticipated the battle to come, Jack secretly palms a medallion so he can be immortal. He then frees Will and duels Barbossa. As Norringtons crew battle the immortal pirates, Elizabeth slips away to free Jacks crew, who flee on the Pearl, leaving her to save Will and Jack by herself. After Elizabeth helps defeat some of Barbossas crewmen, Jack shoots Barbossa just as Will returns the last of the medallions with their blood, which lifts the curse. Now mortal, Barbossa dies from Jacks gunshot, and the rest of Barbossas crew are killed or surrender. At Port Royal, Will declares his love for Elizabeth. He then rescues Jack, who was about to be hanged. After a scuffle, Jack and Will are surrounded by Norringtons soldiers. Elizabeth stands by their side and declares that she will marry Will instead of Norrington. Jack falls into the sea, then is rescued by the Black Pearl, which has a new crew. Norrington decides to give Jack one days head start before pursuing him. Governor Swann gives his blessing to Will and Elizabeth, while Jack is made captain of the Pearl and sails off toward the horizon.",

            "plot": "On October 2, 1988, troubled teenager Donald Donnie Darko sleepwalks outside, led by a mysterious voice. Once outside, he meets a figure named Frank in a monstrous rabbit costume. Frank tells Donnie that the world will end in precisely 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. Donnie wakes up the next morning on the green of a local golf course and returns home to discover a jet engine has crashed into his bedroom. His older sister Elizabeth tells him the FAA investigators do not know its origin.Over the next several days, Donnie continues to have visions of Frank, and his parents, Eddie and Rose, send him to psychotherapist Dr. Thurman. Thurman believes Donnie is detached from reality and that his visions of Frank are daylight hallucinations, symptomatic of paranoid schizophrenia. Frank asks Donnie if he believes in time travel, and Donnie in turn asks his science teacher, Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff. Monnitoff gives Donnie The Philosophy of Time Travel, a book written by Roberta Sparrow, a former science teacher at the school who is now a seemingly senile old woman living outside of town, known to the local teenagers as Grandma Death. Donnie also starts dating Gretchen Ross, who has recently moved into town with her mother under a new identity to escape her violent stepfather.Frank begins to influence Donnies actions through his sleepwalking episodes, including causing him to flood his high school by breaking a water main.

They live a life of poverty as Selma works at a factory with her good friend Kathy, whom she nicknames Cvalda. She rents a trailer home on the property of local police officer Bill Houston and his wife, Linda. She is romantically pursued by the shy but persistent Jeff, who also works at the factory. Selma is gradually losing her vision due to a degenerative eye condition, but still is saving money to pay for an operation that will prevent Gene from sharing her fate. She also takes part in rehearsals for a production of The Sound of Music and accompanies Kathy to the local cinema, where together they watch Hollywood musicals, as Kathy describes them to her. In her day-to-day life, Selma slips into daydreams, imagining herself in a musical Cvalda. Jeff and Kathy begin to realize that Selma\\'s vision is worse than they thought, and that she has been memorizing eye charts in order to pass vision tests and keep her job. Bill reveals to Selma that Linda\\'s excessive spending has put the couple\\'s house in danger of foreclosure by their bank. He has contemplated suicide but cannot bring himself to carry out the act. Selma promises to keep his secret and confides in him about her advancing vision loss. Bill quietly stays without knowing that Selma still sees him and watches her hide her money in a tin. The next day, Selma\\'s boss Norman believes that her eye condition has deteriorated; he accepts her resignation and pays her final wages, but promises to re-hire her once her sight has improved. However, Kathy accuses him of firing her. Not willing to get her job back, Jeff tries to escort her home by car, but she walks home along a railroad bridge instead I\\'ve Seen It All.

Not wanting to reveal her knowledge of the impending foreclosure, Selma ignores Linda and confronts Bill about the theft. They fight over the money, with Bill drawing a gun only to be accidentally shot by Selma. Bill yells for Linda to call the police, saying that Selma has tried to rob him, then begs Selma to kill him, telling her it is the only way she will ever reclaim her stolen money. Selma shoots Bill several times, but only wounds him further due to her poor vision, and finally beats him to death with her safe deposit box once the gun runs out of ammunition. She imagines that Bill\\'s corpse stands up and slow dances with her, and he and Linda absolve her of blame and tell her she just did what she had to do Smith & Wesson. Taking her money back, she flees the house and pays for Gene\\'s operation in advance. Not knowing about the murder, Jeff takes Selma to rehearsal, where her director calls the police to have her arrested In the Musicals, Part 1. In court, she is accused of being a Communist sympathizer and of pretending to be blind to exploit the American healthcare system. Although she tells as much truth about the situation as she can, she refuses to reveal Bill\\'s secret, saying that she had promised not to. When her claim of sending all her money to her father in Czechoslovakia is proven false, she is convicted of murder and sentenced to death In the Musicals, Part 2. Kathy and Jeff eventually figure out what happened and recover Selma\\'s money, using it instead to pay for a trial lawyer who can free her.

His daughter, Rose, takes her reluctant father to see a doctor, who sternly admonishes Alvin to give up tobacco and use a walker, Alvin refuses and instead opts to use two canes. Shortly after, Alvin learns that his brother, Lyle, has suffered a stroke. Longing to visit him, but unable to drive, Alvin develops a plan to travel 240 miles to Mount Zion, Wisconsin on his riding lawnmower, towing a small homemade travel-trailer along the way. This stirs doubt and worry in the minds of his family, friends, and neighbors. Alvin\\'s first attempt fails, after experiencing difficulty starting the old mower\\'s motor, he does not get far before the machine breaks down. Alvin arranges for his mower to be transported back home on a flatbed truck, where he later shoots it with a shotgun out of frustration. At the John Deere dealership, he purchases a used lawn tractor whose transmission is still intact from 1966. On the side of the highway, Alvin passes a young female hitchhiker who later approaches his campfire. In conversation, Alvin deduces that she is pregnant and has run away from home. Alvin tells her about the importance of family by describing a bundle of sticks that is hard to break compared to a single stick. The next day, Alvin emerges from the trailer to find that she has left him a bundle of sticks tied together. Later, a huge group of RAGBRAI cyclists raced past him. He arrives at the cyclists\\' camp and is greeted with applause. That night, he speaks with a pair of friendly cyclists around the campfire about growing old. The next day, Alvin encounters a distraught woman who has just hit a deer in front of him. She drives away after a tearful rant, and Alvin cooks and eats the deer, mounting the antlers on his trailer as a tribute to the deer and the sustenance it provided. Alvin\\'s brakes fail as he travels down a steep hill, after an intense speedy descent, he manages to stop. A man named Danny helps Alvin get his mower and trailer off the main road, discovering that the mower has transmission problems. Now beginning to run low on cash, Alvin calls Rose to ask her to send him his Social Security check. Danny offers Alvin a ride the rest of the way to Lyle\\'s, but Alvin declines, stating that he prefers to travel his own way. Verlyn, an elderly war veteran, takes Alvin into town for a drink. As Alvin does not drink alcohol, he orders a glass of milk, and the two men exchange traumatic stories about their experiences in World War II. Alvin\\'s tractor is fixed, and he is presented with an exorbitant bill by the mechanics, who are twins and are constantly bickering. Alvin successfully negotiates the price down and explains his mission to help his brother. Alvin crosses the Mississippi River and makes camp in a cemetery. He chats with a Catholic priest who recognizes Lyle\\'s name and is aware of his stroke. The priest says that Lyle did not mention he had a brother. Alvin responds that all he wants is to make peace with Lyle after their falling out ten years prior. Finally arriving in Mount Zion, Alvin stops at a bar to ask for directions to Lyle\\'s house and to have a beer, his first drink in years. Alvin experiences engine trouble just a few miles from Lyle\\'s house and stops in the middle of the road. A tractor driver stops to help, then leads the way to Lyle\\'s house. When he arrives, Alvin finds the house dilapidated. He calls for his brother, who appears to be using a walker and invites Alvin to sit down on the porch. Lyle asks if Alvin had ridden the lawnmower all the way just to see him, to which Alvin simply responds, I did, Lyle. The two men sit together silently and gaze up at the stars.",

            "plot": "Karl Childers is a developmentally disabled man whose parents physically and mentally abused him when he was young. He has been in the custody of the state mental hospital since the age of 12 after murdering his mother and her teenage lover, who was also his tormentor, with a sling blade. Karl believed his mother was being raped and killed the teen in her defense. When he realized his mother was a willing participant in the affair, Karl killed her as well. Karl spends his days staring out a window at an open field and rubbing his hands together. As a passive person, he is often forced by fellow patient Charles to listen to stories of him bragging about unsolved crimes of murder rape, who unbeknownst to the hospital was a serial killer. The state determines that Karl is no longer dangerous and releases him. Karl wants to stay and pleads to, but is told that he has to leave. He goes back to his hometown, where he finds work as a small engine mechanic. Karl befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley and shares details of his past, including the killings. Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda, and her gay best friend and boss, Vaughan. Vaughan is concerned about Karl\\'s history, but Linda asks him to move into her garage, angering her abusive and alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle. Vaughan tells Karl that he fears Doyle could hurt or kill Linda and Frank one day. Karl becomes a role model to Frank, who misses his deceased father and despises Doyle. As they grow closer, Karl tells Frank that he is haunted by an incident that happened when he was six or eight years old. His parents performed an abortion of his unwanted baby brother and made him dispose of the body. Karl found the baby was still moving and buried him alive. Karl later visits his sickly father and tries to reconcile, but is rejected. He scolds his father for his past cruelty to him and to his brother and says that he thought many times about killing him, but no longer sees the need. During Doyles latest drunken outburst, where he refuses to leave Lindas house, Frank fights back. Linda later reconciles with Doyle, who announces that he is moving in with them. He tells Karl that he is no longer welcome. When Frank protests, Doyle grabs him, but Karl intervenes and warns him never to touch Frank again. Doyle insists that he is in charge and orders Karl to leave. Realizing that an unhappy childhood or worse awaits Frank, Karl persuades him and Linda to spend the night at Vaughans house. Karl asks Vaughan to promise to look after Frank and Linda. Later that evening, he returns to the Wheatley home carrying a sharpened lawn mower blade, and finds Doyle drunk and alone in the living room. Karl kills Doyle, calls 911, and then eats biscuits with mustard, a childhood favorite, while waiting for the police. Karl is returned to the state hospital, but is now more assertive. Charles tells him more private stories about unsolved crimes involving sexual violence, and then questions him about his relationship with Frank. This angers Karl, who tells Charles to never speak to him again. As Charles walks away, Karl turns towards him and then resumes looking out of the window toward the open field.",

            "plot": "Twenty-five-year-old Mookie lives in Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant with his sister Jade, has a toddler son named Hector with his Latina girlfriend Tina, and works as a delivery man at a pizzeria owned by Italian-American Salvatore Sal Frangione. Sals oldest son, Pino, is a racist who holds contempt for all the neighborhood blacks. Sals younger son, Vito, is friends with Mookie, which Pino feels undermines their fraternal bond.Other residents of the neighborhood include friendly drunk Da Mayor; Mother Sister, who observes the block from her brownstone; Radio Raheem, who blasts Public Enemy Fight the Power on his boombox; Buggin Out, a fast-talking young man who talks about Black civil rights to anyone wholl listen; Smiley, a mentally disabled man who meanders around town with hand-colored pictures of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr; and local DJ Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy.At Sals, Buggin Out questions Sal about his Wall of Fame, decorated with photos of famous Italian-Americans, and demands that Sal put up pictures of Black celebrities since the pizzeria is in a Black neighborhood. Sal refuses, feeling hes not required to put anyone but Italians on the wall, and ejects him. Buggin Out attempts to start boycotting the pizzeria but only Raheem joins him.During the day, local teenagers open a fire hydrant to beat the heat wave before white police officers Mark Ponte and Gary Long intervene. Mookie confronts Pino about his contempt towards African-Americans. Later, Pino expresses his hatred for African-Americans to Sal, who insists on keeping the business in the majority African-American neighborhood.That night, Buggin Out and Raheem march into Sals and demand that the Wall of Fame include Black celebrities. Sal demands that Raheem turn his boombox off, but he refuses. Buggin Out badmouths Sal and threatens to shutter the pizzeria for good. Finally, Sal snaps and smashes Raheems boombox. Enraged, Raheem attacks Sal. A fight ensues that spills out into the street, attracting a crowd. The police arrive, including Long and Ponte, who break up the fight and apprehend Raheem and Buggin Out. As the officers attempt to restrain Raheem, Long begins choking him with his nightstick. Though Ponte and the onlookers plead for him to stop, Long tightens his choke-hold on Raheem, killing him. Attempting to save face, the duo place his body in the back of a police car and drive off.The onlookers blame Sal for Raheems death, but Da Mayor unsuccessfully tries to convince the crowd of Sals innocence. Suddenly, Mookie grabs a trash can and throws it through the pizzerias window, sparking the crowd to destroy it. Smiley sets the building ablaze, and Da Mayor pulls Sal, Pino, and Vito away from the mob, which turns towards the Korean market across the street to destroy it too. Sonny, the owner, eventually dissuades the group.The police return with the fire department and riot patrols to extinguish the fire and disperse the crowd. The firefighters, after several warnings to the crowd, turn their hoses on the mob, enraging them and causing more arrests. The next day, Mookie returns to Sal and demands his weekly pay. After an argument, Sal pays Mookie and the two cautiously reconcile. Mookie leaves to visit Hector as Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy announces that the mayor of New York City has founded a committee to investigate the incident and dedicates a song to Raheem.Before the credits roll are two quotations that demonstrate the dichotomy of the films theme: The first, from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who argues that violence is never justified. The second, from Malcolm X, argues that violence is not violence, but intelligence when it is used in self-defense. The film ends with dedications to six Black people, five\u2014Eleanor Bumpurs, Arthur Miller Jr, Edmund Perry, Yvonne Smallwood, and Michael Stewart\u2014killed by police officers and one\u2014Michael Griffith\u2014killed by a white mob, before fading to black.",

            "plot": "Arrogant collectibles dealer Charlie Babbitt is in the middle of importing four grey market Lamborghinis to Los Angeles for resale. He needs to deliver the cars to impatient buyers who have already made down payments to repay the loan he took out to buy them, but the EPA is holding the cars at the port because they have failed emission tests. Charlie directs an employee to lie to the buyers while he stalls his creditor.When Charlie learns that his estranged father Sanford Babbitt has died, he and his girlfriend Susanna travel to Cincinnati to settle the estate. He inherits only a group of rosebushes and a classic 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible over which he and Sanford had clashed, while the remainder of the 3 million estate is going to an unnamed trustee. He learns that the money is being directed to a local mental institution, where he meets his elder brother Raymond, of whom he was unaware.Raymond is an autistic savant and adheres to strict routines. He has superb recall, but he shows little emotional expression, except when in distress. Charlie spirits Raymond out of the mental institution and into a hotel for the night. Disheartened with the way Charlie treats Raymond, Susanna leaves him. Charlie asks Raymond\\'s doctor, Dr. Gerald Bruner, for half the estate in exchange for Raymond\\'s return, but Bruner refuses. Charlie decides to attempt to gain custody of his brother to get control of the money.After Raymond refuses to fly to Los Angeles, he and Charlie resort to driving there instead. They make slow progress because Raymond insists on sticking to his routines, which include watching The People\\'s Court on television every day, getting to bed by 1100 p.m., and refusing to travel when it rains. He also objects to traveling on the Interstate after they encounter a car accident.During the course of the journey, Charlie learns more about Raymond, including his ability to instantly perform complex calculations and count hundreds of objects at once, far beyond the normal range of human abilities. He also realizes that Raymond had lived with the family as a child and was the Rain Man Charlies infantile pronunciation of Raymond, a comforting figure Charlie had remembered as an imaginary friend. Raymond had saved an infant Charlie from being scalded by hot bathwater one day, but Sanford blamed Raymond for nearly injuring Charlie, and committed him to the institution, as he was unable to speak up for himself and correct the misunderstanding.Charlie\\'s creditor repossesses the Lamborghinis, forcing him to refund his buyers\\' down payments and leaving him deeply in debt. Having passed Las Vegas, he and Raymond return to Caesars Palace and devise a plan to win the needed money by playing blackjack and counting cards. Although the casino bosses obtain videotape evidence of the scheme and ask them to leave, Charlie successfully wins 86000 to cover his debts. He also reconciles with Susanna, who has rejoined the brothers in Las Vegas.Returning to Los Angeles, Charlie meets with Bruner, who offers him 250000 to walk away from Raymond. Charlie refuses, saying he is no longer upset about being cut out of his father\\'s will, but he wants to have a relationship with his brother. At a meeting with a court appointed psychiatrist, Raymond proves to be unable to decide for himself what he wants. Charlie stops the questioning and tells Raymond he is happy to have him as his brother. As Raymond and Bruner board a train to return to the institution, Charlie promises to visit in two weeks.",

            "plot": "During the winter of 1943\u201344, Julien Quentin, a student at a boarding school in occupied France, is returning to school from vacation. He acts tough to the other students, but is actually a pampered boy who misses his mother deeply. Saddened to be returning to the monotony of boarding school, Juliens classes seem uneventful until P\u00e8re Jean, the headmaster, introduces three new pupils. One of them, Jean Bonnet, is the same age as Julien. Like the other students, Julien at first despises Bonnet, a socially awkward boy with a talent for arithmetic and playing the piano.One night, Julien wakes up and finds Bonnet wearing a kippah and praying in Hebrew. After digging through his new friends locker, Julien learns the truth. His real name is not Bonnet, but Kippelstein. P\u00e8re Jean, a compassionate, sacrificing priest at the school, had agreed to grant secret asylum to hunted Jews. After a game of treasure hunt, Julien and Jean bond and develop a close friendship.When Juliens mother visits on Parents Day, Julien asks his mother if Bonnet, whose parents could not come, could accompany them to lunch at a gourmet restaurant. As they sit around the table, the talk turns to Juliens father, a factory owner. When Juliens brother asks if he is still for Marshal P\u00e9tain, Madame Quentin responds, No one is anymore. The Milice arrive and attempt to expel a Jewish diner. When Juliens brother calls them Collabos, the Milice commander is enraged and tells Madam Quentin, We serve France, madam. He insulted us. But when a Wehrmacht officer coldly orders them to leave, the Milice officers grudgingly obey. Juliens mother comments that the Jewish diner appears to be a very distinguished gentleman. She insists that she has nothing against Jews, but would not object if the socialist politician L\u00e9on Blum were hanged.Shortly thereafter, Joseph, the schools assistant cook, is exposed for selling the schools food supplies on the black market. He implicates several students as accomplices, including Julien and his brother, Fran\u00e7ois. Although P\u00e8re Jean is visibly distressed by the injustice, he fires Joseph but does not expel the students for fear of offending their wealthy, influential parents.On a cold morning in January 1944, the Gestapo raid the school, searching for Jean Kippelstein. As his classroom is being searched, Julien unintentionally gives away Bonnet by looking in his direction. As the other two Jewish boys are hunted down, Julien encounters the person who denounced them, Joseph the kitchen hand. Trying to justify his betrayal in the face of Juliens mute disbelief, Joseph tells him, Dont act so pious. Theres a war going on, kid. Disgusted, Julien runs off. Jean and Julien exchange books, a shared habit of theirs, as they pack away their belongings due to the closure of the school.As the students are lined up in the school courtyard, a Gestapo officer denounces P\u00e8re Jeans actions and calls French people weak and undisciplined. A moment later, P\u00e8re Jean, followed by the three Jewish boys in single file is led away across the school yard. One by one, as the priest passes through their midst, the students spontaneously call out to him, Au revoir, mon p\u00e8re! He pauses and half turns towards them and gives a loud reply: Au revoir, les enfants! \u00c0 bient\u00f4t! Jean is the last to exit the school grounds through a metal door in the garden wall. As he steps through the doorway, he glances back for a moment toward Julien, and Julien gives him a timid wave in return.The film ends with an older Julien providing a voiceover epilogue, in which he mentions that Bonnet, Negus and Dupre died at Auschwitz, whereas P\u00e8re Jean died at Mauthausen; the school reopened in October. He explains that although more than 40 years have passed, he will remember every second of that January morning until the day he dies.",

            "plot": "During the Sengoku period, in 1571, Takeda Shingen, daimy\u014d of Kai province from the Takeda clan, meets a thief his brother Takeda NobukadoNobukado has spared from crucifixion due to the thiefs uncanny resemblance to Shingen. The brothers agree that he would prove useful as a double, and they decide to use the thief as a kagemusha, a political decoy. Later, while the Takeda army lays siege to a castle belonging to Tokugawa Ieyasu, Shingen is shot while listening to a flute playing in the enemy camp. He orders his forces to withdraw and, before succumbing to his wound, commands his generals to keep his death a secret for three years. Meanwhile, Shingens rivals Oda Nobunaga, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and Uesugi Kenshin puzzle over the reason for Shingens withdrawal, unaware of his death.Nobukado presents the thief to Shingens generals, proposing to have him impersonate Shingen full-time. Although the thief is unaware of Shingens death initially, he eventually finds Shingens preserved corpse in a large jar, having believed it to contain treasure. The generals then decide they cannot trust the thief and release him. Later, the jar is dropped into Lake Suwa, which spies working for the Tokugawa and Oda forces witness. Suspecting that Shingen has died, the spies go to report their observation, but the thief, having overheard the spies, returns to the Takeda forces and offers to work as a kagemusha. The Takeda clan preserves the deception by announcing that they were simply making an offering of sake to the god of the lake, and the spies are ultimately convinced by the thiefs performance.Returning home, the kagemusha successfully deceives Shingens retinue by imitating the late warlords gestures and learning more about him. When the kagemusha must preside over a clan meeting, he is instructed by Nobukado to remain silent until Nobukado brings the generals to a consensus, whereupon the kagemusha will simply agree with the generals plan and dismiss the council. However, Shingens son Takeda KatsuyoriKatsuyori is incensed by his fathers decree of the three year subterfuge, which delays his inheritance and leadership of the clan. Katsuyori thus decides to test the kagemusha in front of the council, as the majority of the attendants are still unaware of Shingens death. He directly asks the kagemusha what course of action should be taken, but the kagemusha is able to answer convincingly in Shingens own manner, which further convinces the generals.In 1573, Nobunaga mobilizes his forces to attack Azai Nagamasa, continuing his campaign in central Honshu to maintain his control of Kyoto against the growing opposition. When the Tokugawa and Oda forces launch an attack against the Takeda, Katsuyori begins a counter-offensive against the advice of his generals. The kagemusha is then forced to lead reinforcements in the Battle of Takatenjin, and he helps inspire the troops to victory. However, in a later fit of overconfidence, the kagemusha attempts to ride Shingens notoriously temperamental horse, and falls off. When those who rush to help him see that he does not have Shingens battle scars, he is revealed as an impostor, and is driven out in disgrace, allowing Katsuyori to take over the clan. Sensing weakness in the Takeda clan leadership, the Oda and Tokugawa forces are emboldened to begin a full-scale offensive into the Takeda homeland.By 1575, now in full control of the Takeda army, Katsuyori leads a counter-offensive against Nobunaga in Nagashino. Although courageous in their assault, several waves of Takeda cavalry and infantry are cut down by volleys of gunfire from Oda arquebusiers deployed behind wooden stockades, effectively eliminating the Takeda army. The kagemusha, who has followed the Takeda army, desperately takes up a spear and charges toward the Oda lines before being shot himself. Mortally wounded, the kagemusha attempts to retrieve the f\u016brinkazan banner, which had fallen into a river, but succumbs to his wounds in the water where his body is carried away by the current.",

            "plot": "Middle-aged, simple-minded Chance lives in a wealthy old mans townhouse in Washington, DC, along with the mans African-American maid Louise, who is kind to Chance. He has spent his whole life tending the garden and never left the property. Other than gardening, his knowledge is derived entirely from television. When the old man dies, his estate lawyers order Chance out. He wanders aimlessly, discovering the outside world for the first time. An African-American youth points a knife at him; Chance ineffectually tries to click him out of existence with a TV remote control. Passing by a TV shop, Chance sees himself captured by a video camera in the shop window. Entranced, he steps backward off the sidewalk and is struck by a limousine chauffeuring Eve Rand, the glamorous and much younger wife of elderly business mogul Ben Rand. When she asks him his name she mishears Chance, the gardener as Chauncey Gardiner. Eve brings Chance to their palatial estate to be seen by Dr. Allenby, who is resident there caring for Ben, who is slowly dying from a blood disease. After checking Chauncey out, the doctor invites him to stay to keep an eye on him. Chaunceys manners are old-fashioned and courtly, and he wears expensively-tailored but outmoded 1930s clothes he took from his former employers attic. When Ben meets him he takes Chauncey for an upper-class, highly-educated businessman fallen on hard times. Ben admires him, finding him direct, wise and insightful. Ben is also a confidant and advisor to the President of the United States, whom he introduces to Chauncey. In a discussion about the economy, Chance takes his cue from the words stimulate growth and talks about the changing seasons of the garden. The President misinterprets this as optimistic political advice and quotes Chauncey Gardiner in a speech. Chance now rises to national prominence, attends important events, develops a close connection with the Soviet ambassador, and appears on a talk show during which his detailed advice about what a serious gardener should do is misunderstood as his opinion on presidential policy. Louise tells other African Americans as they watch Chance on TV that he has rice pudding between the ears and that whiteness is all that is needed to succeed in America. The President is shown as sexually impotent with his wife when watching the show. Though Chance has now risen to the pinnacle of Washington society, the Secret Service and 16 foreign agencies are unable to find any background information on him. Meanwhile, Allenby becomes increasingly suspicious that Chance is not a wise political expert and that his mysterious identity may have a more mundane explanation. Allenby considers telling Ben, but remains silent when he realizes how happy Chance is making him in his final days. The dying Ben encourages Eve to become close to Chauncey. She is already attracted to him and makes a sexual advance. Chance has no interest in or knowledge of sex, but mimics a kissing scene from the 1968 film The Thomas Crown Affair, which happens to be on TV. When the scene ends, Chance stops suddenly and Eve is confused. She asks what he likes, meaning sexually; he replies I like to watch, meaning television. She is momentarily taken aback, but masturbates for his voyeuristic pleasure, not noticing he has turned back to the TV and is imitating Lilias, Yoga and You on another channel. Chance is present at Bens death and shows genuine sadness. Questioned by Allenby, he admits that he loves Eve very much and also that he is just a gardener. When he leaves to inform Eve of Bens death, Allenby says to himself, I understand. While the President delivers a speech at Bens funeral, the pallbearers hold a whispered discussion over potential replacements for the President in the next presidential term, and unanimously agree on Chauncey as successor. Oblivious, Chance wanders off through Bens wintry estate. He straightens out a pine sapling flattened by a fallen branch, then walks across the surface of a lake without sinking. He pauses, dips his umbrella deep into the water to the right of his path, then continues on, while the President is heard quoting Ben: Life is a state of mind.",

            "plot": "Comedian Alvy Singer is trying to understand why his relationship with Annie Hall ended a year ago. Growing up in Brooklyn, he vexed his mother with impossible questions about the emptiness of existence, but he was precocious about his innocent sexual curiosity, suddenly kissing a classmate at six years old and not understanding why she was not keen to reciprocate.Annie and Alvy, waiting in a cinema queue to see The Sorrow and the Pity, overhear another man deriding the work of Federico Fellini and Marshall McLuhan. Alvy imagines McLuhan himself stepping in at his invitation to criticize the mans comprehension. That night, Annie shows no interest in sex with Alvy. Instead, they discuss his first wife, whom he kept at a distance for no good reason. His second marriage was to a New York writer who did not share his enthusiasm for sports and was unable to reach orgasm.With Annie, it is different. The two of them have fun cooking a meal of boiled lobster together. He teases her about the unusual men in her past. They had met playing tennis doubles with friends. Following the game, awkward small talk leads her to offer him a ride uptown, and then a glass of wine on her balcony. There, what seemed a mild exchange of trivial personal data is revealed in mental subtitles as an escalating flirtation. Their first date follows Annies singing audition for a nightclub It Had to be You. After their lovemaking that night, Alvy is a wreck, while Annie relaxes with a joint.Soon, Annie admits she loves Alvy, while he buys her books on death and says that his feelings for her are more than just love. When Annie moves in with him, things become very tense. Eventually, Alvy finds her arm-in-arm with one of her college professors, and the two begin to argue about whether this is the flexibility they had discussed. They eventually break up, and he searches for the truth of relationships, asking strangers on the street about the nature of love, questioning his formative years, and imagining a cartoon version of himself arguing with a cartoon Annie portrayed as the Evil Queen in Snow White.Alvy attempts a return to dating, but the effort is marred by neurosis and an episode of bad sex that is interrupted when Annie calls in the middle of the night, insisting that he come over immediately to kill a spider in her bathroom. A reconciliation follows, coupled with a vow to stay together, come what may. However, their separate discussions with their therapists make it evident there is an unspoken and unbridgeable divide. When Alvy accepts an offer to present an award on television, they travel to Los Angeles with Alvys friend Rob. However, on the return trip, they agree that their relationship is not working. After losing Annie to her record producer Tony Lacey, Alvy unsuccessfully tries rekindling the flame with a marriage proposal. Back in New York, he stages a play of their relationship, but he changes the ending: now she accepts.The last meeting between Annie and Alvy is a wistful coda on Manhattans Upper West Side after they have both moved on to someone new. Alvys voice returns with a summation: Love is essential, especially if it is neurotic. Annie sings Seems Like Old Times, and the credits roll.",

The two panicked robbers take the bank employees hostage.Police Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti calls the bank, and Sonny bluffs that he is prepared to kill the hostages. Sal assures Sonny that he is ready to kill if necessary. A security guard has an asthma attack, so Sonny releases him as a display of good faith. Moretti convinces Sonny to step outside.

The crowd begins to cheer for Sonny.Sonny demands a vehicle to drive himself and Sal to the airport, so that they can board a jet. He also demands that pizzas be brought to the hostages, and that his wife be brought to the bank.

Frederick actively distances himself from his grandfather  the infamous  He even pronounces his surname as Fronkensteen. When Frederick inherits the family estate in Transylvania, he travels to Europe to inspect the property. At the Transylvania train station, Frederick is met by a hunchbacked, bug-eyed servant named Igor, whose own grandfather worked for Victor. A young woman named Inga also greets him.Arriving at the estate, Frederick meets Frau Bl\u00fccher, the dour intimidating housekeeper. After discovering the secret entrance to Victor\\'s laboratory and reading his private journals, Frederick resumes his grandfather\\'s experiments in re-animating the dead.Frederick and Igor steal a recently-executed criminal\\'s corpse.

The Monster becomes enraged by electrical sparks from a thrown switch and escapes the castle.While roaming the countryside, the monster has encounters with a young girl and a blind hermit.

            "plot": "In northern Iraq, priest Lankester Merrin takes part in an archaeological dig in the ancient ruins of Hatra. During the dig, he finds a stone talisman of a winged being that evokes a concerned look on his face. He then has a vision in which a giant version of the same being appears nearby, silently confronting him. In Georgetown, Washington, D.C., actress Chris MacNeil is starring in a film directed by her friend Burke Dennings. MacNeil, along with her 12-year-old daughter Regan, rents a luxurious house with hired help. Meanwhile, Father Damien Karras, a psychiatrist who counsels Georgetown University priests, visits his ailing mother in New York City. He later confides to a colleague that he is having a crisis of faith. Chris hosts a party with Karras\\'s friend, Father Dyer, who explains Karras\\'s role as counselor and notes his mother\\'s recent death. Regan, seemingly unwell, appears and urinates before Chris comforts her. Regan\\'s bed shakes violently after Chris returns her to it. Later, Dyer consoles Karras, guilty at not having been with his mother when she died. Regan\\'s personality becomes violent. Medical tests find no physical cause. During a house call, Regan exhibits abnormal strength. One night, Chris finds the house empty except for a sleeping Regan; Dennings is found dead at the bottom of a set of public stairs that begin beneath Regan\\'s window. Detective William Kinderman questions Karras, confiding that Dennings\\'s head was turned backward. Regan\\'s body becomes covered with sores. Kinderman tells Chris that the only plausible explanation for Dennings\\'s death is that he was pushed from Regan\\'s window. As Kinderman leaves, Regan has another violent fit, stabbing her vagina with a crucifix and turning her head backward. She is confined to her bedroom. Now convinced that her daughter is possessed, Chris seeks out Karras, who visits Regan. The possessed Regan claims to be the Devil, and vomits into Karras\\'s face while speaking in tongues. The demon says it will remain in Regan until she is dead. At night, Chris\\'s assistant calls Karras to the house; he concludes that an exorcism is warranted. His superior grants permission on the condition that an experienced priest lead the ritual. Merrin, having performed an exorcism before, is summoned. Merrin arrives at the house. As the two priests read from the Roman Ritual, the demon curses them. The priests rest and Merrin, shaking, takes nitroglycerin. Karras enters the bedroom where the demon appears as his mother, perturbing Karras despite his denials. Merrin excuses Karras and continues the exorcism by himself. Karras assures Chris that Regan will not die and re-enters the room, finding Merrin dead from a heart attack while Regan watches and laughs. Karras beats the possessed Regan in a fit of rage and demands that the demon take him instead. The demon rips the medallion of Saint Joseph from Karras\\'s neck and possesses him, freeing Regan in the process. Karras jumps out the window, tumbling down the stone stairs outside. Chris and Kinderman enter the room. Chris embraces the healed Regan, and Kinderman surveys the scene. Outside, Dyer administers the dying Karras last rites. The MacNeils prepare to leave, and Father Dyer says goodbye. Despite having no memory of her ordeal, Regan, moved by the sight of Dyer\\'s clerical collar, kisses him on the cheek. As the MacNeils leave, Chris gives Dyer the medallion found in Regan\\'s room. Dyer briefly examines the steps where Karras died before walking away.",

            "plot": "In 1951, Sonny Crawford and Duane Jackson are high school seniors and friends in Anarene, an oil town in Texas. Duane is dating Jacy Farrow, the prettiest and richest girl in the small town. Sonny breaks up with his girlfriend Charlene Duggs. He is secretly in love with Jacy. At a Christmas dance, Jacy is invited by Lester Marlow to a skinny-dipping party at the home of Bobby Sheen, a wealthy young man who seems to be a better prospect than Duane. At the same dance, Sonny kisses Ruth Popper, the depressed middle-aged wife of his high school coach. Jacy goes to the skinny-dipping party where Bobby makes an advance on her, but then says he will not have sex with girls who are still virgins. Duane, Sonny and others take their young, mentally disabled friend, Billy, to a prostitute to lose his virginity. When the group takes Billy home, local businessman Sam The Lion is angered by the groups treatment of Billy. Sam forbids the group from entering any of his businesses, the only entertainment sources of Anarene: the pool hall, the movie theater, and the cafe. Later, Sam notices that Sonny actually takes good care of Billy, who habitually sweeps the dusty Anarene main street with a broom. Sam accepts Sonny back into the cafeteria. During the weekend of New Years Eve, Duane and Sonny go on a road trip to Mexico. Before they drive off, Sam wistfully wishes he still had the stamina to join them and gives them some extra money so they can enjoy themselves. The boys return two days later, hung over and tired, and learn that Sam has died suddenly of a stroke. Sams will leaves the pool hall to Sonny. Jacy invites Duane to a motel room to have sex, because she wants Bobby to accept her into his libertine circle, but Duane is unable to get an erection. She gets angry at Duane and berates him for being impotent. She later agrees to try again and goes with him to the same motel. Duane is able to perform, albeit very briefly, and just enough for Jacy to lose her virginity. She breaks up with Duane by telephone in anticipation of becoming Bobbys lover and girlfriend. However, Jacy learns that Bobby has already married another girl. Out of boredom and a sense of rejection, Jacy has sex with Abilene, a roughneck foreman who works for her father and is her mothers lover. Abilene drops Jacy off at her home and is brutally cold towards her. After entering the house, Jacy is caught by her mother Lois and starts crying. They both complain about the brutality of men. Sad and angry because of the breakup, Duane enlists in the Army and is scheduled to serve in the Korean War after basic training. In Duanes absence, Jacy sets her sights on Sonny, who drops Ruth and starts dreaming of marrying Jacy. Duane returns home on leave, driving a brand-new Mercury. He fights with Sonny over Jacy, smashing a beer bottle into Sonnys eye. Sonny is hospitalized. During his recovery, he pretends to be asleep when Ruth visits him. Jacy and Sonny elope and are married in Oklahoma. While driving to their honeymoon, Jacy reveals that she left a note to her parents explaining the entire plan. They are stopped by a state trooper who takes them to a police station where the Farrows await. Gene Farrow dismisses Sonny completely, taking Jacy home in his car. Sonny rides back with Lois and Lois reveals that Sam the Lion was her one true love when she was young. Lois tells Sonny that he would be much better off with Ruth than with Jacy. The marriage is annulled and a short time passes. On Duanes last night of leave, Sonny goes to Duanes house for a last chance of reconciliation. The two friends make amends and Sonny reveals that Jacy went to college in Dallas and never returned to Anarene. They go to the movies because the theater is going to close due to a lack of customers. The last picture show is Red River. The next morning, Sonny sees Duane off on the bus. Duane asks Sonny to take care of his Mercury after Sonny reveals that he and Jacy never made it to the motel. Sonny opens the pool hall and hears a truck braking in the street nearby. The truck has killed Billy as he swept the road. Sonny approaches the local townsmen surrounding Billys corpse; they blame the dead boy for being stupid and careless. Grief stricken, Sonny yells at the men for their behavior and carefully carries Billys body to the top of a staircase, covering Billys face with his letterman jacket. Angry and depressed with his current life, Sonny drives to the city limits. He slowly changes his mind and drives back, parking his truck near Ruths home. He goes to her door and shyly asks to come in for a cup of coffee. She looks depressed and has shuttered herself in her house. After letting him in, Ruth explodes in hurt and anger, breaking the coffee cup, she notices that Sonny is completely devastated. She demands that he look at her. He does and gently touches her hand. Still spent, she seems to forget her anger, takes pity on the boy, and starts to comfort him.",

            "plot": "In 1899 Wyoming, Butch Cassidy is the affable, clever, talkative leader of the outlaw Hole-in-the-Wall Gang. His closest companion is the laconic dead-shot Sundance Kid. The two return to their hideout at Hole-in-the-Wall to discover that the rest of the gang, irked at Cassidys long absences, have selected Harvey Logan as their new leader.Logan challenges Cassidy to a knife fight over the gangs leadership. Cassidy defeats him using trickery, but embraces Logans idea to rob a Union Pacific train on both its eastward and westward runs, agreeing that the second robbery would be unexpected and likely reap more money than the first.The first robbery goes well. To celebrate, Cassidy visits a favorite brothel in a nearby town, where the town marshal unsuccessfully attempts to organize a posse to track down the gang, only to have his address to the townsfolk hijacked by a friendly bicycle salesman. Sundance, meanwhile, visits his lover, schoolteacher Etta Place. Cassidy joins up with them the next morning, and takes Place for a ride on his new bike.On the second train robbery, Cassidy uses too much dynamite to blow open the safe. The explosion demolishes the baggage car in the process and the money flies everywhere. As the gang scrambles to gather it, a second train arrives carrying a six-man team of lawmen. The crack squad pursues Cassidy and Sundance, who try to hide out in the brothel, and then to seek amnesty from Sheriff Bledsoe, to no avail.The posse remains in pursuit, and it includes renowned Indian tracker Lord Baltimore and lawman Joe Lefors, recognizable by his white skimmer. Cassidy and Sundance elude their pursuers by jumping from a cliff into a river far below. They learn from Place that the posse has been paid by Union Pacific head E. H. Harriman to remain on their trail until they are both killed.Cassidy convinces Sundance and Place that the three should go to Bolivia, which he envisions as a robbers paradise. On their arrival there, Sundance is dismayed by the living conditions and regards the country with contempt, but Cassidy remains optimistic. However, they know too little Spanish to pull off a bank robbery, so Place attempts to teach them the language. With her as an accomplice, they become successful bank robbers known as Los Bandidos Yanquis. However, their confidence drops after seeing a man wearing a white skimmer and fear that Harrimans posse is still after them.Cassidy suggests going straight, and he and Sundance land their first honest job as payroll guards for a mining company. However, they are ambushed by local bandits on their first run and their boss, Percy Garris, is killed. They kill the bandits, the first time Cassidy has ever shot someone. The duo concludes the straight life is not for them. Sensing they will be killed should they return to robbery, Place decides to return to the United States.Cassidy and Sundance steal a payroll and a burro used to carry it, and arrive in a small town. A boy recognizes the burros livestock branding and alerts the police, leading to a gunfight with the outlaws. Cassidy has to make a desperate run to the burro to get ammunition, while Sundance provides covering fire. Wounded, the two take cover inside a building. Cassidy suggests their next destination should be Australia. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the two men, the local police have called on the Bolivian Army. The pair charge out of the building, guns blazing, into a hail of bullets from the massed troops who have occupied all the surrounding vantage points. The film ends with the sound of gunfire on a freeze-frame shot of the two bandits.",

            "plot": "After earning his bachelor\\'s degree, Benjamin Braddock returns to his parents\\' home in Pasadena, California. During his graduation party, Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father\\'s law partner, asks him to drive her home. Once there, she tries to seduce him. At first he resists her advances but later changes his mind. He invites Mrs. Robinson to the Taft Hotel, where he registers under the surname Gladstone. Benjamin spends the summer idly floating in his parents\\' swimming pool and meeting Mrs. Robinson at the hotel. During one of their trysts, Mrs. Robinson reveals that she and her husband married after she accidentally became pregnant with their daughter, Elaine. When Benjamin jokingly suggests that he date Elaine, Mrs. Robinson angrily forbids it. His parents and Mr. Robinson relentlessly pester Benjamin to ask Elaine out. He reluctantly takes her on a date, to Mrs. Robinson\\'s displeasure. Ben attempts to sabotage the date by ignoring Elaine, driving recklessly and taking her to a strip club. She flees the club in tears, but Benjamin chases after her, apologizes and kisses her. They eat at a drive-in restaurant, where they bond over their shared uncertainty about their future plans. After they visit the Taft Hotel for a late-night drink and the staff greet Benjamin as Mr. Gladstone, Elaine deduces that Benjamin is having an affair. Benjamin admits to having an affair with a married woman whom he does not name. He tells Elaine the affair is over and asks to see her again. To prevent Benjamin from dating Elaine, Mrs. Robinson threatens to tell her about their affair. To thwart this, Benjamin tells Elaine that the married woman is her mother. Elaine is so upset that she throws Benjamin out of the house and soon returns to school at Berkeley. Benjamin follows her there, hoping to regain her affections. Elaine initially rejects him and briefly dates medical student Carl Smith. When she learns her mother lied about Benjamin raping her, she reconciles with him. Benjamin pushes for an early marriage, but Elaine is uncertain despite her feelings for him. Mr. Robinson arrives at Berkeley and angrily confronts Benjamin. He informs him that he and Mrs. Robinson are getting divorced and threatens to have him jailed if he keeps seeing Elaine. Mr. Robinson forces Elaine to leave college to marry Carl. Benjamin drives to Pasadena and breaks into the Robinson home searching for Elaine. Instead he finds Mrs. Robinson, who tells him that he cannot prevent Elaine\\'s marriage to Carl. Benjamin flees the house and drives back to Berkeley. There he discovers the wedding is in Santa Barbara that very day. He speeds over 300 miles to Santa Barbara, but his car runs out of gas a short distance from the church. Benjamin runs to the church, arriving just as the ceremony is ending. His desperate appearance in the glass church gallery stirs Elaine into defying her mother and fleeing the sanctuary. Benjamin fights off Mr. Robinson and repels the wedding guests by swinging a large cross, which he uses to barricade the church doors, trapping everyone inside. Benjamin and Elaine escape aboard a bus and sit among the startled passengers, with Elaine still in her wedding gown. As the bus drives on, their ecstatic smiles slowly change into neutral expressions as they begin to ponder their uncertain future together.",

            "plot": "Guido Anselmi, a famous Italian film director, is suffering from director's block. Stalled on his new science fiction film that includes thinly veiled autobiographical references, he has lost interest amidst artistic and marital difficulties. While attempting to recover from his anxieties at a luxurious spa, Guido hires a well-known critic to review his ideas for his film, but the critic blasts them. Guido has recurring visions of an Ideal Woman, whom he sees as key to his story. His mistress Carla comes to visit him, but Guido puts her in a separate hotel. The film production crew relocates to Guido's hotel in an unsuccessful attempt to get him to work on the film. Guido admits to a cardinal that he is not happy. The cardinal offers little insight. Guido invites his estranged wife Luisa and her friends to join him. They dance, but Guido abandons her for his production crew. Guido confesses to his wife's best friend Rosella that he wanted to make a film that was pure and honest, but he is struggling with something honest to say. Carla surprises Guido, Luisa, and Rosella outside the hotel, and Guido claims that he and Carla ended their affair years earlier. Luisa and Rosella call him on the lie, and Guido slips into a fantasy world where he lords over a harem of women from his life, but a rejected showgirl starts a rebellion. The fantasy women attack Guido with harsh truths about himself and his sex life. When Luisa sees how bitterly Guido represents her in the film, she declares that their marriage is over. Guido's Ideal Woman arrives in the form of an actress named Claudia. Guido explains that his film is about a burned-out man who finds salvation in this Ideal Woman. Claudia concludes that the protagonist is unsympathetic because he is incapable of love. Broken, Guido calls off the film, but the producer and the film's staff announce a press conference. Guido attempts to escape from the journalists and eventually imagines shooting himself in the head. Guido realizes he was attempting to solve his personal confusion by creating a film to help others, when instead he needs to accept his life for what it is. He asks Luisa for her assistance in doing so. Carla tells him that she figured out what he was trying to say: that Guido cannot do without the people in his life. The men and women hold hands and walk briskly around the circle with Guido and Luisa joining them last.",

            "plot": "Fast Eddie Felson is accompanied by his partner, Charlie, at a pool room in a small town. Pretending to be salesmen on their way to a convention, Eddie and Charlie convince onlookers that Eddie is a drunk blowhard, and induce them to bet on Eddie to lose a trick shot. He wins and takes their money. Eddie and Charlie arrive in Ames, Iowa,  where Eddie challenges the legendary player Minnesota Fats to play straight pool for 200 a game. After initially falling behind, Eddie surges back to being 1,000 ahead and suggests raising the bet to 1,000 a game. Eddie gets ahead 11,000 and Charlie tries to convince him to quit, but Eddie insists the game will end only when Fats says it is over. Fats agrees to continue after a spectator, the professional gambler Bert Gordon, labels Eddie a loser. After 25 hours and an entire bottle of bourbon, Eddie is ahead over 18,000, but loses it all along with all but 200 of his original stake. Fats declares the game over. At their hotel later, Eddie leaves a sleeping Charlie without saying goodbye. Eddie stashes his belongings in a locker at a bus terminal, where he meets Sarah Packard, an alcoholic. They begin a relationship and he moves in with her. Charlie finds Eddie at Sarahs apartment and tries to persuade him to go back out on the road. Eddie refuses and Charlie realizes he plans to challenge Fats again. Eddie learns that Charlie had money he could have used to rebound and beat Fats. Eddie dismisses Charlie as a scared old man and tells him to lay down and die by yourself. Eddie joins a poker game where Bert is playing. Afterward, Bert tells Eddie that he has talent as a pool player but no character. He figures that Eddie will need at least 3,000 to challenge Fats again. Bert calls him a born loser but nevertheless offers to stake him in return for 75% of his winnings, Eddie refuses. Eddie goes back to hustling to get the money he needs to play Fats. After hustling a local player at a pool room near the waterfront, Eddie is attacked after winning and his thumbs are broken. After Sarah helps Eddie convalesce, and when he\u2019s ready to play, he agrees to Berts terms, deciding that a 25% slice of something big is better than a 100% slice of nothing. Bert, Eddie and Sarah travel to the Kentucky Derby, where Bert arranges a match for Eddie against a wealthy local socialite named Findley. The game turns out to be three-cushion billiards, not pool. When Eddie loses badly, Bert refuses to keep staking him. Sarah pleads with Eddie to leave with her, saying that the world he is living in and its inhabitants are perverted, twisted, and crippled, he refuses. Seeing Eddies anger, Bert agrees to let the match continue at 1,000 a game. Eddie comes back to win 12,000. He collects his 3,000 share and decides to walk back to the hotel where he discovers that Sarah has committed suicide, because of Berts sadism. Eddie returns to challenge Fats again, putting up his entire 3,000 stake on a single game. He wins game after game, beating Fats so badly that Fats is forced to quit. Bert demands half of Eddies winnings and threatens to have him beaten unless he pays. Eddie says he will come back to kill Bert if he survives, shaming Bert into giving up his claim by invoking Sarahs memory. Instead, Bert orders Eddie never to walk into a big-time pool hall again. Eddie and Fats compliment each other as players, and Eddie walks out.",

            "plot": "A helicopter transports a statue of Christ over an ancient Roman aqueduct outside Rome while a second, Marcello Rubini's news helicopter, follows it into the city. The news helicopter is momentarily sidetracked by a group of bikini-clad women sunbathing on the rooftop of a high-rise apartment building. Hovering above, Marcello uses gestures to elicit phone numbers from them but fails in his attempt. He then shrugs and continues following the statue to Saint Peter's Square. Marcello meets Maddalena by chance in an exclusive nightclub. A beautiful and wealthy heiress, Maddalena is tired of Rome, while Marcello finds it suits him. They have sex in the bedroom of a prostitute whom they had given a ride home in Maddalena's Cadillac. Marcello returns to his apartment to find that his fianc\u00e9e, Emma, has overdosed. On the way to the hospital, he declares his everlasting love to her and again as she lies in a semiconscious state in the emergency room. While waiting frantically for her recovery, however, he tries to make a phone call to Maddalena. That day, he goes on assignment for the arrival of Sylvia, a famous Swedish-American actress, at Ciampino airport where she is met by a horde of news reporters. During Sylvia's press conference, Marcello calls home to ensure Emma has taken her medication while reassuring her that he is not alone with Sylvia. After the film star confidently replies to the barrage of journalists' questions, her boyfriend Robert enters the room late and drunk.  Marcello casually recommends to Sylvia's producer that she be taken on a tour of St Peter's. Inside St Peter's dome, a news reporter complains that Sylvia is an elevator because none of them can match her energetic climb up the numerous flights of stairs. Inspired, Marcello maneuvers forward to be alone with her when they finally reach the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square. They almost share a kiss. That evening, the infatuated Marcello dances with Sylvia in the Baths of Caracalla. Sylvia's natural sensuality triggers raucous partying while Robert, her bored fianc\u00e9, draws caricatures and reads a newspaper. His humiliating remark to her causes Sylvia to leave the group, eagerly followed by Marcello and his paparazzi colleagues. Finding themselves alone, Marcello and Sylvia spend the rest of the evening in the alleys of Rome, where they wade into the Trevi Fountain. Like a magic spell that has suddenly been broken, dawn arrives at the very moment Sylvia playfully anoints Marcello's head with fountain water. They drive back to Sylvia's hotel to find an enraged Robert waiting for her in his car. Robert slaps Sylvia, orders her to go to bed, and then assaults Marcello, who takes it in stride. Marcello meets Steiner, his distinguished intellectual friend, inside a church. Steiner shows off his book of Sanskrit grammar. The two go up to play the organ, offering up a jazz piece for the watching priest before playing Bach. Late afternoon, Marcello, his photographer friend Paparazzo, and Emma drive to the outskirts of Rome to cover the story of the purported sighting of the Madonna by two children. Although the Catholic Church is officially skeptical, a huge crowd of devotees and reporters gathers at the site. That night, the event is broadcast over Italian radio and television. Emma prays to the Virgin Mary to be given sole possession of Marcello's heart. Blindly following the two children from corner to corner in a downpour, the crowd tears a small tree apart for its branches and leaves said to have sheltered the Madonna. The gathering ends at dawn with the crowd mourning a sick child, a pilgrim brought by his mother to be healed, but trampled to death in the melee. One evening, Marcello and Emma attend a gathering at Steiner's luxurious home, where they are introduced to a group of intellectuals who recite poetry, strum the guitar, offer philosophical ideas, and listen to sounds of nature recorded on tape. The British poet Iris Tree, whose poetry Marcello has read and admired, recommends that Marcello avoid the prisons of commitment: Stay free, available, like me.  Never get married.  Never choose.  Even in love, it's better to be chosen. Emma appears enchanted with Steiner's home and children, telling Marcello that one day he will have a home like Steiner's, but he turns away moodily. Outside on the terrace, Marcello confesses to Steiner his admiration for all he stands for, but Steiner admits he is torn between the security that a materialistic life affords and his longing for a more spiritual albeit insecure way of life. Steiner philosophizes about the need for love in the world and fears what his children may grow up to face one day. Marcello spends the afternoon working on his novel at a seaside restaurant, where he meets Paola, a young waitress from Perugia playing Perez Prado's cha-cha Patricia on the jukebox and then humming its tune. He asks her if she has a boyfriend, then describes her as an angel in Umbrian paintings. Marcello meets his father visiting Rome on the Via Veneto. With Paparazzo, they go to the Cha-Cha Club, where Marcello introduces his father to Fanny, a beautiful dancer and one of his past girlfriends he had promised to get her picture in the paper but failed to do it. Fanny takes a liking to his father. Marcello tells Paparazzo that as a child he had never seen much of his father, who would spend weeks away from home. Fanny invites Marcello's father back to her flat, and two other dancers invite the two younger men to go with them.  Marcello leaves the others when they get to the dancers' neighborhood. Fanny comes out of her house, upset that Marcello's father has become ill. Marcello's father has suffered what seems to be a mild heart attack. Marcello wants him to stay with him in Rome so they can get to know each other, but his father, weakened, wants to go home and gets in a taxi to catch the first train to Cesena. He leaves Marcello forlorn, on the street, watching the taxi leave. Marcello, Nico, and other friends meet on the Via Veneto and are driven to a castle owned by aristocrats at Bassano di Sutri outside Rome. There is already a party long in progress, and the party-goers are bleary-eyed and intoxicated. By chance, Marcello meets Maddalena again. The two of them explore a suite of ruins annexed to the castle. Maddalena seats Marcello in a vast room and then closets herself in another room connected by an echo chamber. As a disembodied voice, Maddalena asks him to marry her; Marcello professes his love for her, avoiding answering her proposal. Another man kisses and embraces Maddalena, who loses interest in Marcello. He rejoins the group, and eventually spends the night with Jane, a British artist and heiress. Burnt out and bleary-eyed, the group returns at dawn to the main section of the castle, to be met by the matriarch of the castle, who is on her way to mass, accompanied by priests in a procession. Marcello and Emma are alone in his sports car on an isolated road. Emma continues an argument by professing her love and tries to get out of the car; Marcello pleads with her not to get out. Emma says that Marcello will never find another woman who loves him the way she does. Marcello becomes enraged, telling her that he cannot live with her smothering, maternal love. He now wants her to get out of the car, but she refuses.  With some violence a bite from her and a slap from him, he throws her out of the car and drives off, leaving her alone on a deserted road at night. Emma hears Marcello's car returning as she holds wildflowers picked from the roadside. She gets into the car with neither of them saying a word. Later, they are asleep in bed, tenderly intertwined, when Marcello receives a phone call. He rushes to the Steiners' apartment and learns that Steiner has killed his two children and himself. Marcello is interrogated by the police and afterwards volunteers to accompany an officer on his way to meet Steiner's wife. After waiting at the bus stop, Marcello identifies Steiner's wife when she arrives. He and the officer escort her to the car to break the terrible news, while the paparazzi swarm around them snapping pictures. An unspecified amount of time later, an older Marcello\u2014now with gray in his hair\u2014has quit journalism and abandoned his attempt at writing a book to become a publicist. He and a group of partygoers break into a Fregene beach house owned by Riccardo, a friend of Marcello's. Many of the men are homosexual. To celebrate her recent divorce from Riccardo, Nadia performs a striptease to Perez Prado's cha-cha Patricia. Riccardo shows up at the house and tells the partiers to leave. The drunken Marcello attempts to provoke the other partygoers into an orgy. However, their inebriation causes the party to descend into mayhem, with Marcello riding a young woman crawling on her hands and knees and throwing pillow feathers around the room. The party proceeds to the beach at dawn where they find a modern-day leviathan, a bloated, sea ray-like creature, caught in the fishermen's nets. In his stupor, Marcello comments on how its eyes stare even in death. Paola, the adolescent waitress from the seaside restaurant in Fregene, calls to Marcello from across an estuary, but the words they exchange are lost on the wind, drowned out by the crashing waves. He signals his inability to understand what she is saying or interpret her gestures. He shrugs and returns to the partygoers; one of the women joins him and they hold hands as they walk away from the beach. In a long final close-up, Paola waves to Marcello and then stands watching him with an enigmatic smile.",

            "plot": "In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, small-town lawyer Paul Biegler, a former district attorney who lost his re-election bid, spends most of his time fishing, playing the piano, and hanging out with his alcoholic friend and colleague Parnell McCarthy and sardonic secretary Maida Rutledge. One day, Biegler is contacted by Laura Manion to defend her husband, US Army Lieutenant Frederick Manny Manion, who has been arrested for the murder of innkeeper Bernard Barney Quill. Manion does not deny the murder, but claims that Quill raped his wife. Even with such a motivation, getting Manion cleared of murder would be difficult, but Manion claims to have no memory of the event, which suggests he may be eligible for a defense of irresistible impulsea version of a temporary insanity defense. It is strongly implied that Manion is faking insanity, having been guided to it as a potential defense by Biegler. Bieglers folksy speech and laid-back demeanor hide a sharp legal mind and a propensity for courtroom theatrics that keeps the judge busy maintaining control. However, the case for the defense does not go well, especially as local district attorney Mitch Lodwick is assisted by high-powered prosecutor Claude Dancer from the Attorney Generals office. Furthermore, the prosecution tries at every instance to block any mention of Manions motive for killing Quill. Biegler eventually manages to get the rape of Laura Manion into the record and Judge Weaver agrees to allow the matter to be part of the deliberations. During cross-examination, Dancer insinuates that Laura openly flirted with other men, including the man she claimed raped her. Psychiatrists give conflicting testimony to Manions state of mind at the time that he killed Quill. Dancer says that Manion may have suspected Laura of cheating on him because he asked her, a Catholic, to swear on a rosary that Quill raped her. This raises doubt as to whether the act was consensual. Quills estate is to be inherited by Mary Pilant, whom Dancer accused of being Quills mistress. McCarthy learns that Pilant is in fact Quills daughter, a fact she is anxious to keep secret since she was born out of wedlock. Biegler, who is losing the case, tries to persuade Pilant that Al Paquette, the bartender who witnessed the murder, may know if Quill admitted to raping Laura but Paquette is covering this up, either because he loves Pilant or out of loyalty to Quill. Through Pilant, Biegler is unable to get Paquette to testify on behalf of Manion. During the trial, Laura claims that Quill tore off her underwear while raping her; the underwear was not found where she alleged the rape took place. Pilant, previously unaware of any details of the case, hears this during the trial and then tells Biegler and later testifies that she found the panties in the inns laundry room the morning after the alleged rape. Biegler suggests Quill may have attempted to avoid suspicion by dropping the panties down the laundry chute located next to his room. Dancer tries to establish that Pilants answers are founded on her jealousy. When Dancer asserts forcibly that Quill was Pilants lover and that Pilant lied to cover this fact, Pilant shocks everyone by stating that Quill was her father. Manion is found not guilty by reason of insanity. After the trial, Biegler decides to open a new practice, with a newly sober McCarthy as his partner. The next day, Biegler and McCarthy travel to the Manions trailer park home to get Manions signature on a promissory note which they hope will suffice as collateral for a desperately needed loan. It turns out the Manions have vacated the trailer park, the superintendent commenting that Laura Manion had been crying. Manion left a note for Biegler, indicating that his flight was an irresistible impulse, the same justification Biegler used during the trial. Biegler states that Mary Pilant has retained him to execute Quills estate; McCarthy says that working for her will be poetic justice.",

            "plot": "Along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, a time bomb placed inside a vehicle explodes, killing two people. Mexican special prosecutor Miguel Vargas, who is honeymooning in town with his new American wife Susie, takes an interest in the investigation, which is being conducted by veteran police captain Hank Quinlan and his devoted, admiring, fanatically loyal assistant, Pete Menzies. Quinlan is a recovering alcoholic and an anti-Mexican bigot. He lost a leg long ago, and now walks with a prosthetic game leg and a cane. He implicates Sanchez, a young Mexican man secretly married to the victims daughter. During the interrogation at Sanchezs apartment, Menzies finds two sticks of dynamite in a shoe-box in the bathroom.  Vargas, who had accidentally knocked over the shoe-box a few minutes earlier and found it empty, accuses Quinlan of planting the dynamite, and begins to suspect that many of his previous convictions were similarly tainted. Quinlan angrily dismisses Vargas allegation. Uncle Joe Grandi, the acting leader of a crime family Vargas has been investigating, makes common cause with Quinlan against Vargas, and plies Quinlan with liquor, causing him to break his sobriety. Grandi orders his family to capture and drug Susie with illegal recreational drugs; while she is unconscious, he and Quinlan lock her in a hotel room. Quinlan then murders Grandi and leaves the body there with Susie; however, drunk and exhausted, he carelessly also leaves his cane in the room with them. When Susie wakes up and sees the body, she screams for help, and gets arrested on suspicion of the murder, which infuriates Vargas. Searching the room, Menzies finds Quinlans cane, and realizes that Quinlan is the real killer. Vargas, reviewing Quinlans past successes, confirms his suspicion that Quinlan has planted evidence in many of the cases. He confronts Menzies, who sadly agrees to work with him to expose Quinlan, by wearing a wire and getting a confession. Quinlan hears an echo from Vargas recording device, and realizes that Menzies is betraying him. He shoots and mortally wounds Menzies. He then aims his gun at Vargas, but the dying Menzies shoots Quinlan before he can fire. Susie is exonerated and reunited with Vargas. As Quinlan dies, it is revealed that Sanchez has confessed to the original bombing and that Quinlans efforts had all been for nothing.",

            "plot": "One night in Manhattan, slick, up-and-coming press agent Sidney Falco scans the New York Globe for the column of the immensely popular journalist J.J. Hunsecker, an influential media kingpin whose journalistic contributions and associated radio show both dominate the entertainment world. For the fifth consecutive day, J.J. has neglected to publicize any of Sidneys clients, as he is overly protective of his 19-year-old younger sister Susan and has asked Sidney to end her recent affair with Steve Dallas, a budding jazz guitarist. Later, at the Elysian Room, where Steve performs with his group, the Chico Hamilton Quintet, Sidney argues with his uncle and Steves manager, Frank D\u2019Angelo, who has promised him that Steve and Susan will part. Upon learning from his girlfriend Rita, a cigarette girl, that Susan is awaiting Steve behind the club, he interrupts the pairs celebration. Steve, who mainly values integrity, angrily accuses him of scratching for information like a dog. Inside, Rita appeals to Sidney to help her retain her job, which is at risk because she refused to sleep with J. Js main competitor, the prominent columnist Leo Bartha, who then ordered her dismissal. After Sidney secures a date with Rita, Susan questions his relationship with J.J. inside a cab, but he reassures her that J.J. is a close friend of his. Outside the 21 Club, J.J. greets his informer, Harry Kello, a corrupt police lieutenant, who is long indebted to J. J. for petitioning the mayor to save his job after Kello beat a suspect severely. When Sidney reveals Steves and Susans engagement, J.J. gives him an ultimatum to destroy their relationship. Desperate to salvage his career, he vows not to disappoint J.J. Sidney attempts to blackmail Leo at Toots Shors Restaurant and Lounge by threatening to expose his marital infidelity with Rita unless Leo prints a defamatory gossip item stating that Steve is a Communist who smokes marijuana. Instead, Leo chooses exposure over compromising his journalistic integrity, which even his wife Loretta praises as his first decent act in years. Sidney then bribes another columnist, Otis Elwell, who agrees to print the item if Sidney will arrange for him to receive a sexual favor from an available woman. At his apartment, Rita balks at the implications of getting acquainted with Otis, but ultimately assents to Sidneys plan in order to stay employed. The next morning, the smear appears in Otiss column and the Chico Hamilton Quartet is fired. As planned, J.J. theatrically gets Steve rehired with a phone call in front of Susan, but Steve rebukes him for being a malignant influence on society. Forced to choose between them, an overwhelmed Susan breaks up with Steve, hoping to save him from J.Js vengeance. Planning to destroy Steves career, an incensed J.J. orders Sidney to plant marijuana on Steve; a shocked Sidney balks, saying he can accept a dog collar but not a noose, but once J. J. offers to let Sidney write his column for three months while he vacations with Susan in Europe, he acquiesces. At the Elysian Room, Sidney slips the cigarettes into the pocket of Steves coat. Once Steve finishes work that evening, Kello accosts him outside and so assaults him that he is hospitalized. At a bar, surrounded by his industry cohorts, Sidney celebrates his accomplishment but is then summoned to J.Js penthouse apartment. He arrives to find a distraught Susan in her nightgown, about to commit suicide by jumping off the balcony. He barely rescues her, and takes her into her bedroom to rest. Upon arriving to find the two holding each other, J.J. harshly scolds him. Realizing that Susan set him up, Sidney irately reveals to her that J.J. conspired to frame Steve; he then departs, vowing to reveal the truth and informing J.J. that Susan is permanently lost to him. J.J. then calls Kello and tells him Steve is innocent, ordering Sidney to be arrested for planting the evidence. As Sidney exits the building, Kello stops and brutally beats him. As Susan packs her belongings, J.J. unsuccessfully begs her to stay; she coolly informs him that death is preferable to living with him. An overwrought J.J. watches from the balcony as she strides into the coming dawn to start life afresh with her lover.",

            "plot": "Gelsomina, an apparently somewhat simpleminded, dreamy young woman, learns that her sister Rosa has died after going on the road with the strongman Zampan\u00f2. Now the man has returned a year later to ask her mother if Gelsomina will take Rosa\\'s place. The impoverished mother, with other mouths to feed, accepts 10,000 lire, and her daughter tearfully departs the same day.Zampan\u00f2 makes his living as an itinerant street performer, entertaining crowds by breaking an iron chain bound tightly across his chest, then passing the hat for tips. In short order, Gelsomina\\'s na\u00efve and antic nature emerges, with Zampan\u00f2\\'s brutish methods presenting a callous foil. He teaches her to play the snare drum and trumpet, dance a bit, and clown for the audience. Despite her willingness to please, he intimidates her, forces himself upon her, and treats her cruelly at times. She develops a tenderness for him that is betrayed when he goes off with another woman one evening, leaving Gelsomina abandoned in the street. Yet here, as throughout the film, even in her wretchedness, she manages to find beauty and wonder, aided by some local children.Finally, she rebels and leaves, making her way into town. There she watches the act of another street entertainer, Il Matto (The Fool), a talented high wire artist and clown. When Zampan\u00f2 finds her there, he forcibly takes her back. They join a ragtag travelling circus where Il Matto already works. Il Matto teases the strongman at every opportunity, though he cannot explain what motivates him to do so. After Il Matto drenches Zampan\u00f2 with a pail of water, Zampan\u00f2 chases after his tormentor with his knife drawn. As a result, he is briefly jailed, and both men are fired from the travelling circus.Before Zampan\u00f2\\'s release from prison, Il Matto proposes to Gelsomina that there are alternatives to her servitude and imparts his philosophy that everything and everyone has a purpose \u2013 even a pebble, even she. A nun suggests that Gelsomina\\'s purpose in life is comparable to her own. But when Gelsomina offers Zampan\u00f2 marriage, he brushes her off.On an empty stretch of road, Zampan\u00f2 comes upon Il Matto fixing a flat tire. As Gelsomina watches in horror, the two men begin to fight; it ends after the strongman punches the clown on the head several times, causing the fool to hit his head on the corner of his car\\'s roof. As Zampan\u00f2 walks back to his motorcycle with a warning for the man to watch his mouth in the future, Il Matto complains that his watch is broken, then stumbles into a field, collapses, and dies. Zampan\u00f2 hides the body and pushes the car off the road, where it bursts into flames.The killing breaks Gelsomina\\'s spirit and she becomes apathetic, constantly repeating, The Fool is hurt. Zampan\u00f2 makes a few small attempts to console her, but in vain. Fearful he will no longer be able to earn a living with Gelsomina, Zampan\u00f2 abandons her while she sleeps, leaving her some clothes, money, and his trumpet.Some years later, he overhears a woman singing the very tune Gelsomina often played. He learns that the woman\\'s father had found Gelsomina on the beach and kindly taken her in. However, she had wasted away and died. Zampan\u00f2 gets drunk, gets in a fight with the locals, and wanders to the beach, where he breaks down in tears.",

            "plot": "In a German prisoner-of-war camp named Stalag 17, one of its compounds holds 630 American airmen all of whom are sergeants, and is overseen by camp warden Oberst von Scherbach. In December 1944, the men of Barracks 4led by appointed barracks chief Hoffy Hoffman, and security officer Frank Pricearrange for the escape of fellow airmen Manfredi and Johnson. The pair are shot dead in the attempt, and the men believe they were betrayed by an informant. Suspicion falls on J. J. Sefton, an enterprising cynic who barters openly with the German guards for various luxuries. He also creates profitable ventures that distract from the mundanity of camp life: from organizing rat races for gambling, to an improvised distillery for brewing alcohol, to a makeshift telescope to spy on the Russian women from a neighboring compound. Clarence Cookie Cook, who narrates the story, serves as Sefton\\'s naive and loyal aide. The men of Barracks 4 do their best to keep sane, which includes enduring the antics of barracks clowns Animal Kuzawa and Harry Shapiro, and listening for war news on a smuggled radio. Their jovial guard, Feldwebel Schulz, secretly retrieves hidden messages from a hollow black queen on the chessboard, and straightens the looped cord of a dangling light bulb, which serves as a signal between himself and the informant. Just before Christmas, a recently captured Lieutenant Dunbar is assigned to Barracks 4 until he can be sent to an officers camp. Sgt. Bagradian, who accompanies Dunbar, reveals that Dunbar rigged a time bomb in transit and blew up a munitions train. Sefton recognizes Dunbar from officers school, and believes that he only passed because of his rich family, creating tension between them. Schulz announces that an inspector from the Geneva Convention will arrive, and Sefton bribes the guards to let him spend the day with the Russian women. The radio is later confiscated by Schulz. Concluding that Sefton was rewarded for revealing the radio, the men confront him when he returns, but Sefton denies he was responsible. Von Scherbach interrupts to arrest Dunbar as a saboteur; the men blame Sefton again and brutally beat him. The next day, the inspector from Geneva arrives with Red Cross parcelsincluding 2,000 ping-pong balls, which the prisoners use to create smoke bombs. The inspector is then told about Dunbar\\'s removal, and he warns von Scherbach that Dunbar cannot be convicted without proof, lest there be war crime trials. Von Scherbach hands Schulz a black queen to be delivered to the informant. During the Christmas Eve celebrations, Price steathily switches out the black queen, reads the hidden message, and then resets the signal. Sefton, recovering from his beating, notices the signal afterwards and becomes suspicious. Price gets Bagradian to reveal the recipe of Dunbar\\'s time bomb: a lit cigarette tucked into a matchbook. That night, an air raid siren forces the men to evacuate. Sefton hides and witnesses Price speaking German to Schulz, and demonstrating the time bomb as evidence against Dunbar. On Christmas Day, the SS arrive to take Dunbar to Berlin. While Hoffy has Price guard Sefton who is still believed to be the informant, he gathers the men to rescue Dunbar. A riot and an ignited smoke bomb distracts the guards, and Dunbar is taken to hide in a latrine\\'s water tower until nightfall. After von Scherbach threatens to raze the camp, the men of Barracks 4 decide that one of them must help Dunbar escape. Price volunteers, and Sefton finally accuses him of being a German spy. Sefton interrogates Price and reveals the messaging system he used; the men are convinced and Price tries to flee, but he is quickly restrained. Anticipating a generous reward, Sefton decides to rescue Dunbar. He retrieves the Lieutenant, and the prisoners throw Price out of the barracks with cans tied to his leg. Price attracts the spotlights of every guard tower and is gunned down; Sefton and Dunbar escape amidst the chaos. The prisoners return to their bunks, and Cookie whistles When Johnny Comes Marching Home.",

            "plot": "Crown Princess Ann is on a tightly scheduled tour of European capital cities for her unnamed nation. After an especially hard day in Rome, her doctor gives her an injection and advises: Best thing I know is to do exactly what you wish for a while. She secretly leaves the embassy to explore the city and, as the drug takes effect, falls asleep atop a low wall, where Joe Bradley, an American reporter, finds her. Not recognizing her, he thinks she is intoxicated and takes her to his apartment to sleep it off. Joe oversleeps and misses the princess\\'s press conference, but claims to his editor, Hennessy, that he attended. Hennessy shows him a news item about the cancellation of the press conference due to the princess\\'s sudden illness. Joe realizes the woman in his apartment is the princess from the newspaper photograph. Joe asks Hennessy what he would pay for an exclusive interview with her. Hennessy offers $5000, and counters with a $500 bet that Joe will not be able to get it. Joe calls his photographer friend, Irving Radovich, and offers to show Anya around Rome, without revealing that he is a reporter. Ann cites an important appointment and leaves. Joe follows and sees her explore an outdoor market, buy shoes, and get her long hair cut short. Joe contrives to meet her on the Spanish Steps and convinces her to spend the day with him, taking her to a street caf\u00e9 to meet up with Irving, who takes pictures with a camera concealed in his cigarette lighter. Ann claims to be playing truant from school. When Ann clumsily drives a Vespa through Roman traffic with Joe as a passenger, they are arrested, but Joe and Irving show their fake press passes and are released. They tour the Colosseum. Joe then takes Ann to the Mouth of Truth and tells her the legend attached to it: if a liar puts their hand in the mouth, it will be bitten off. After Ann tries it, when it is Joe\\'s turn, he startles her by pretending that his hand was cut off. At a dance on a boat, agents from Ann\\'s government try to forcibly take her back. Ann joins Joe and Irving in the fight that breaks out. When Joe is knocked into the river, Ann jumps in after him. They swim away and kiss as they sit shivering on the riverbank. While drying their wet clothes at Joe\\'s apartment, a radio bulletin says that the people of Ann\\'s country are concerned that her illness may be serious. Ann asks Joe to drive her to a corner near the embassy, where they kiss again. She bids him a tearful farewell. Upon her return, the princess replies to those attempting to remind her of her duty, Were I not completely aware of my duty to my family and my country, I would not have come home tonightor indeed ever again. Joe tells a disbelieving Hennessy that he did not get the story, although he tells Irving he cannot stop him from selling the photographs. Joe and Irving attend the rescheduled press conference, to Ann\\'s surprise. She asserts her faith in relations between nations just as between people, and Joe assures her that her faith is not misplaced. When asked which city she most enjoyed visiting, she begins to say it would be difficult before declaring Rome. By all means, Rome. Other photographers take pictures with their large press cameras, while Irving makes a show of using his cigarette lighter. Ann speaks briefly with each journalist, and Irving presents her with his photographs as a memento of Rome. Joe remains behind after everyone else leaves, before walking from the room.",

            "plot": "In Edwardian England, Louis DAscoyne Mazzini, 10th Duke of Chalfont, is in prison, awaiting his hanging for murder the following morning. As he writes his memoirs, a flashback ensues.His mother, the youngest daughter of the 7th Duke of Chalfont, eloped with an Italian opera singer named Mazzini and was disowned by her family for marrying beneath her station. The Mazzinis were poor but happy until Mazzini died shortly after Louis was born. Louis's mother raises him on the history of her family and tells him how, unlike most other peerages, the dukedom of Chalfont can descend through female heirs. Louis's only childhood friends are Sibella and her brother, the children of a local doctor.When Louis leaves school, his mother writes to her kinsman Lord Ascoyne DAscoyne, a private banker, for assistance in launching her son in a career, but is rebuffed. Louis is forced to work as an assistant in a draper's shop. When his mother dies, her last request, to be interred in the family burial vault at Chalfont Castle, is denied. Louis proposes marriage to Sibella, but she ridicules his proposal, and marries Lionel Holland, a former school friend of her brother who has a rich father. Soon after this, Louis quarrels with a customer, Ascoyne DAscoyne, the banker's only child, who has him dismissed from his job.Louis resolves to kill Ascoyne DAscoyne and the other seven people ahead of him in the order of succession to the dukedom. After arranging a fatal boating accident for Ascoyne DAscoyne and his mistress, Louis writes a letter of condolence to his victim's father, Lord Ascoyne DAscoyne, who employs him as a clerk. Upon his later promotion, Louis takes a bachelor flat in St James's, London, for assignations with Sibella.Louis next targets Henry DAscoyne, a keen amateur photographer. He meets Henry and is charmed by his wife, Edith. He substitutes petrol for paraffin in the lamp of Henry's darkroom, with fatal results. Louis decides the widow is fit to be his duchess. The Reverend Lord Henry DAscoyne is the next victim. Posing as the Bishop of Matabeleland, Louis poisons Lord Henry's after-dinner port. From the window of his flat, Louis then uses a bow and arrow to shoot down the balloon from which the suffragette Lady Agatha DAscoyne is dropping leaflets over London. Louis next sends General Lord Rufus DAscoyne a jar of caviar which contains a bomb. Admiral Lord Horatio DAscoyne presents a challenge, as he rarely sets foot on land. However, by chance he conveniently insists on going down with his ship after causing a collision at sea.When Edith agrees to marry Louis, they notify Ethelred, the childless, widowed eighth duke. He invites them to spend a few days at Chalfont Castle. When Ethelred casually informs Louis that he intends to remarry in order to produce an heir, Louis arranges a hunting accident. Before shooting the duke, he reveals his motive. Lord Ascoyne DAscoyne dies from the shock of learning that he has become the ninth duke, sparing Louis from having to murder his kindly employer. Louis inherits the dukedom, but his triumph proves short-lived.Sibella's husband, Lionel, had made a drunken plea to Louis for financial help to avoid bankruptcy, but Louis turned him down flat. Lionel is later found dead, and a Scotland Yard detective arrests Louis on suspicion of murder. Louis elects to be tried by his peers in the House of Lords. During the trial, Louis and Edith are married. Sibella falsely testifies that Lionel was about to seek a divorce and name Louis as co-respondent. Ironically, Louis is convicted of a murder he had never even contemplated.Louis is visited by Sibella, who observes that the discovery of Lionel's suicide note and Edith's death would free Louis and enable them to marry, a proposal to which he agrees. Moments before his hanging, the discovery of the note secures his release. Louis finds both Edith and Sibella waiting for him outside the prison, but is undecided which to choose. When a reporter tells him that Tit-Bits magazine wishes to publish his memoirs, Louis suddenly remembers that he has left them behind in his cell (thereby providing the authorities with a complete confession).",

            "plot": "Joe Stefanos arrives in Bridgeport, California, a rural mountain town, seeking Jeff Bailey, who owns a local gas station. Joe meets The Kid, Jeffs deafmute employee and friend, and asks him about Jeffs whereabouts. Meanwhile, Jeff is fishing with Ann Miller and they are in love. Her lifelong friend Jim is jealous. The Kid shows up at the fishing spot and interrupts them, signing to Jeff that someone is asking about him. Jeff returns to the gas station and Stefanos tells Jeff that he must go to Lake Tahoe to meet Whit and that it has been a long time since they met. Jeff invites Ann to ride with him to Whits place. He tells her about his past in a flashback that took place three years ago. Jeff Baileys real name is Jeff Markham. He and Jack Fisher were partners and private investigators in New York. Whit Sterling, a gambling kingpin, hires Markhamsoloto find Whits girlfriend, Kathie Moffat, who shot Whit and stole 40000 from him. Whit promises Jeff she will not be harmed if he finds her and has her returned to him. Jeff eventually corners Kathie in Acapulco. He is immediately taken by her beauty. She admits she shot Whit and that she hates him, but denies taking his money. Eventually, Jeff falls in love with her and proposes that they run away together. Suddenly, Whit and Stefanos show up at Jeffs place in Acapulco. They ask Jeff if he managed to find Kathie but he lies to them and says that Kathie is on a southbound steamer. Whit instructs Jeff to keep looking for her. Jeff and Kathie then secretly run to San Francisco. At first they avoid appearing in public spaces, but then feel more comfortable to go out as time moves on. However, Jack Fisher, who is now working for Whit, spots Jeff at the track. Jeff arranges to meet Kathie to split and then meet at a mountain cabin to lose Fisher from trailing him, but Fisher chooses to follow Kathie instead and catches them at the cabin. Fisher tries to blackmail them and the two men brawl. Kathie deliberately kills Fisher and drives away, leaving behind a bank book showing a balance of 40000. She had in fact taken Whits money. The flashback ends. Jeff wants to clean things up and return to Ann. Ann drops him off at Whits estate. A cheerful Whit tells Jeff he has a job for him. To his surprise, Jeff finds out that Kathie went back to Whit and she appears as the two men have breakfast. She later comes to speak privately with Jeff and she tells him that she had no choice but to come back. She told Whit about their relationship but not about what happened to Fisher. He tells her to get out. Leonard Eels, a crooked San Francisco lawyer, helped Whit dodge 1 million in taxes and is now blackmailing him. Whit wants Jeff to recover the incriminating records and tells him to meet with Eelssecretary. The secretary, Meta Carson, explains the plan to Jeff, who suspects he is being framed. That night, at Eels apartment, Jeff alerts Eels, obliquely, promising to return. After Jeff and Meta leave Eels apartment, Jeff trails Meta, then returns and finds Eels dead. He decides to hide the body in the closet. Jeff then sneaks into Metas apartment, and overhears Kathie arranging for the discovery of Eels body. When the hidden body is not found, she believes Eels has escaped. Jeff confronts her, and Kathie reveals that she gave Whit a signed affidavit swearing that Jeff killed Fisher. She says they can start all over again. They kiss, he leaves. Stefanos arrives and confirms to Kathie that he killed Eels. Jeff consigns the tax papers to a delivery service. Whits thugs capture him. He offers the incriminating records in exchange for the affidavit, without implicating Kathie. When Kathie and Meta arrive at Eels apartment to retrieve the affidavit, the police are already there. The women instead phone Whit. Jeff becomes wanted for the murders of Fisher and Eels, and police expect him to return to Bridgeport. Stefanos, directed by Kathie, trails the Kid to the gorge where Jeff is hiding out. The Kid spots Stefanos poised to shoot Jeff and hooks his coat with a fishing line, pulling him off-balance so that he falls to his death. Jeff returns to Whits mansion to inform them of Stefanos death and to tell Whit about Kathies doublecross. He suggests making Stefanos death look like a guiltridden suicide after his murder of Eels. He will return the records if Whit destroys Kathies affidavit and hands her over to the police for Fishers death. Whit accepts, promising Kathie he will kill her if she does not cooperate. Jeff meets Ann in the woods. She believes in him, but tells him to be absolutely sure of what he wants. She will wait. Jeff discovers that Kathie has killed Whit. She gives Jeff a choice: run away with her or take the blame for all three murders. He dials the phone while she is upstairs packing. They leave in a car with Jeff driving. Seeing a police roadblock ahead, Kathie shoots him. She fires at the police. A machine gun riddles the car with bullets, killing her. In Bridgeport, Ann asks the Kid if Jeff was going away with Kathie. Lying, the Kid nods his head. Ann gets into Jims car, and the Kid smiles, saluting Jeffs name on the gas stations sign.",

            "plot": "In a railway station refreshment room, a man and a woman are sitting glumly at a table when one of the woman\\'s friends comes in and immediately begins chatting away. After some terse pleasantries, the man leaves to catch his train. The man\\'s companion explains that the man is about to move to Africa. After the man leaves, the companion briefly disappears without warning but returns, explaining that she wanted to see the express train. After a short interval, the two women head for their own train.At home, Laura Jesson, the woman at the table, sits in the living room with her husband Fred. Although Fred is a kind man, he lacks Laura\\'s ear for music and seems more interested in filling out the crossword than conversing with his wife. Laura silently reflects on her recent experiences, which she retells in the form of a confession to her husband.Like many women of her social standing at the time, Laura visits a nearby town every week to shop and watch a matin\u00e9e film. During one such outing to Milford, while waiting in the railway station\\'s refreshment room, she is assisted by a fellow passenger, Alec Harvey, who removes a piece of grit from her eye. Alec is an idealistic general practitioner who also works as a consultant at the local hospital on Thursdays. Both Laura and Alec are married with children, although Alec\\'s wife Madeleine and their two sons are never seen.The two encounter each other again by chance the following week outside Boots the Chemist, and during a third meeting, they share a table at lunch. With time to spare, they attend an afternoon performance at the Palladium Cinema. They soon become uneasy as their innocent, casual relationship begins to deepen, verging on infidelity. They eventually admit they love each other.Laura and Alec continue meeting in public until they unexpectedly run into some of Laura\\'s friends, necessitating the first of many deceptions. Eventually, they agree to make love at the flat of Alec\\'s friend Stephen, who has dinner plans. However, Stephen returns unexpectedly. Stephen overhears Laura sneaking out and subtly chides Alec for his infidelity. A distraught Laura wanders the streets for three hours until a concerned police officer urges her to go home.Alec surprises Laura at the train station. They admit to each other that it is impossible for them to maintain their relationship. Alec reveals that he has been offered a job in Johannesburg, South Africa, where his brother lives. Although he was initially unsure whether to take it, he decides he must leave England to put a definitive end to his affair with Laura, and to avoid hurting their families. He offers to leave the decision to Laura, but Laura replies, That\\'s unkind of you, my darling.The next week, Laura and Alec have their final meeting in the railway station refreshment room, now seen with the poignant perspective of their shared history. As they prepare to part for the last time, Dolly Messiter, an acquaintance of Laura\\'s, interrupts them, oblivious to their anguish.Alec\u2019s train arrives before they can say a proper goodbye. He discreetly squeezes Laura\u2019s shoulder as he departs, leaving her with Dolly. Laura, overcome with emotion, nearly commits suicide by jumping in front of an express train. However, she gathers herself and returns home to her family.At home, Laura is nearly overcome with emotion. Fred senses her turmoil and acknowledges Laura\\'s emotional distance, though whether he understands the cause remains unclear. He thanks her for coming back to him, and she weeps in his arms.A parallel subplot involves the interactions of the station and refreshment room staff. Two of the staff flirt with each other but cannot engage in public displays of affection during work hours, which humorously contrasts with Laura and Alec\\'s ability to meet openly with each other and inability to have a relationship outside of work hours.",

            "plot": "Three returning World War II veterans meet on a flight to their midwestern hometown of Boone City: USAAF bombardier captain Fred Derry, U.S. Navy petty officer Homer Parrish, and U.S. Army sergeant Al Stephenson. Each had left a very different life behind: Fred Derry was a drug store soda jerk who lived with his parents on the wrong side of the tracks. Before shipping out, Fred married a gold-digger named Marie after a whirlwind romance. Marie has since been working in a nightclub to fill her time in spite of Freds generous combat pay as an Air Force officer. Al Stephenson was an executive at a bank and lived in a luxury apartment with his wife, Milly, and their teenage children, Peggy and Rob. Homer Parrish was a star high school athlete living with his middleclass parents and younger sister. Homer had also been dating his nextdoor neighbor Wilma, whom he intended to marry upon his return from the war. Each man faces challenges integrating back into civilian life. Homer lost both hands in the war and though he has become functional in the use of his mechanical hooks, he cannot believe that Wilma will still want to marry him. Al, tired and jaded from the war, returns to the bank and is given a promotion, but wrestles with alcohol. Though highly decorated, Fred suffers from PTSD flashbacks by night. Fred arrives home and cannot locate his party girl wife, who does not expect him. The Stephensons and their daughter Peggy invite Fred along with them for the evening, bar hopping in celebration of Als return. An inebriated Fred keeps asking Peggy who she is, and she keeps reminding him that she is Als daughter. Although proficient in managing the challenges of his disability, Homer is frustrated by his loss of independence and adjusting to his relationship with Wilma. Concerned that Wilma does not fully understand the difficulties of being married to him with his disabilities, Homer demonstrates to her how she will need to assist him at bedtime when he removes his harness with his prosthetic hands, leaving him helpless. Wilma believes she can commit herself to him for life. Al continues to struggle with reentry into normal life. Widely respected by the banks senior management for his past business acumen, Al is criticized after approving an unsecured loan to a farmer and fellow veteran who wants it to buy forty acres, but has no collateral for the purchase. With inhibitions lowered by excessive drinking, Al gives a speech at a banquet that satirizes requiring a veteran to provide collateral before risking his life to take a hill in battle. Unable to find a better job than soda jerk, Fred returns to the same drug store. Fred and Peggy develop an attraction for each other, which puts the married Fred at odds with Al. When Homer visits Fred at the drug store, another customer criticizes US involvement in the war, telling Homer his injuries were unnecessary. Homer responds angrily, and Fred intervenes on his behalf, punching the customer and consequently being fired. Meanwhile, Marie, frustrated with his lack of financial success and missing her past nightlife, decides to get a divorce. Bitter, and seeing no future in Boone City, particularly with Al telling Fred to stay away from Peggy, Fred decides to catch the next plane out. While waiting at the airport, Fred walks into an aircraft boneyard, climbing into a decommissioned B17 bomber. Sitting in the bombardiers seat, Fred has another flashback. He is roused out of his stressful memories by a work crew foreman, who reveals that the planes are being demolished for use in the growing prefab housing industry. Fred asks if they need any help in the budding business and is hired. Al, Milly, and Peggy attend Homer and Wilmas wedding, where Fred is best man. Now divorced, Fred reunites with Peggy after the ceremony. Fred expresses his love but says things may be financially difficult if she stays with him. Peggys smile expresses her joy.",

The Wizard appears as a giant ghostly head and tells them he will grant their wishes if they bring him the Wicked Witch\\'s broomstick.During their quest, Dorothy and Toto are captured by flying monkeys and taken to the Wicked Witch, but the ruby slippers protect her and Toto manages to escape, leading the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion to the castle. They free Dorothy, but are pursued and finally cornered by the Witch and her guards. The Witch taunts them and sets fire to the Scarecrow\\'s arm. When Dorothy throws a bucket of water onto the Scarecrow, she inadvertently splashes the Witch, causing her to melt away.The Witch\\'s guards gratefully give Dorothy her broomstick, and the four return to the Wizard, but he tells them to return tomorrow. When Toto pulls back a curtain, the \"Wizard\" is revealed to be an ordinary man operating machinery that projects a ghostly image of his face. The four travelers confront the Wizard, who insists he is a good man at heart, but confesses to being a humbug. He then \"grants\" the wishes of Dorothy\\'s three friends by giving them tokens to confirm that they have the qualities they sought.The Wizard reveals that he, like Dorothy, is from Kansas and accidentally arrived in Oz in a hot air balloon. When he offers to take Dorothy back to Kansas with him aboard his balloon, she accepts, but Toto jumps off and Dorothy goes after him, and the balloon accidentally lifts off with just the Wizard aboard. Glinda reappears and tells Dorothy she always had the power to return to Kansas using the ruby slippers, but had to find that out for herself.

            "plot": "The family of wealthy mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey attends his 85th birthday party at his estate. The next morning, Harlans housekeeper Fran discovers him dead with a slit throat. Police detectives Lieutenant Elliot and Trooper Wagner believe Harlan died by suicide, but private detective Benoit Blanc is anonymously hired to investigate Harlans death. Blanc learns Harlan had strained relationships with his family members, giving several of them plausible motives for murder. Unbeknown to Blanc, Harlans nurse Marta Cabrera believes she injected Harlan with a lethal dose of morphine after mixing up his medications the night after the party. To protect Marta from the consequences of the irreversible overdose, Harlan instructed Marta to create a false alibi and then slit his own throat. Marta cannot lie without vomiting, so she gives accurate but incomplete answers when questioned. She agrees to assist Blancs investigation and conceals evidence incriminating her. At the reading of Harlans will, Marta is bequeathed his entire fortune, stunning the Thrombeys. Harlans grandson Ransom Drysdale helps Marta flee but manipulates her into confessing to him. Ransom offers further assistance in exchange for a portion of Martas inheritance. Meanwhile, the other Thrombeys unsuccessfully attempt to convince Marta to renounce the inheritance. Marta receives a blackmail note containing a partial photocopy of Harlans toxicology report. She and Ransom drive to the medical examiners office to find it burned down. Marta receives an email proposing a meeting with the blackmailer; Blanc and the police spot them, and after a brief car chase, Ransom is arrested. At the meeting, Marta finds Fran has been drugged; she performs CPR and calls an ambulance. Marta confesses to Blanc but discovers Ransom has already implicated her. Out of moral obligation, Marta believes she must confess to the Thrombeys, which would invalidate the bequest under the slayer rule. At the mansion, Marta finds Frans copy of the full toxicology report, which shows Harlan had only trace amounts of morphine in his blood. Blanc reveals his deductions to the police, Marta, and Ransom. Blanc deduces Harlan told Ransom about his will, prompting Ransom to swap Harlans medicines to cause Marta to kill him. However, Marta actually gave Harlan the correct medication, recognizing it without reading the label due to her experience as a nurse; she only believed she had poisoned Harlan after reading the label on the bottle with the switched content. When the death was reported as a suicide, Ransom anonymously hired Blanc to entrap Marta. Fran saw Ransom tampering with the crime scene and sent him the blackmail note. After Ransom realized that Marta was not responsible for Harlans death but believed she was, he forwarded the blackmail letter to Marta and burned down the medical examiners office to destroy evidence of her innocence. Ransom then overdosed Fran with morphine, intending for Marta to be caught with Frans corpse. The hospital calls; Marta relays that Fran has survived and will implicate Ransom. Ransom insists he will avoid criminal charges because his attempt to kill Fran failed. Marta then vomits on Drysdale, revealing she lied: Fran is dead. Realizing he has confessed to the murder, and that the police officers recorded his confession, Ransom grabs a knife from Harlans collection and attacks Marta, but the knife is a harmless retractable stage knife, and the police promptly arrest him. Blanc tells Marta he suspected early on she played a part in Harlans death, noting a drop of blood on her shoe. He tells Marta her innocence prevailed because she made ethical choices that obstructed Ransoms attempts to incriminate her. As Ransom is taken into custody, Marta watches from the balcony of what is now her mansion, with the Thrombeys gathered outside.",

Heavily indoctrinated with Nazi ideals, he has an imaginary friend named Adolf, a buffoonish version of Adolf Hitler. The local HJ training camp is run by the conflicted Hauptmann Captain Klenzendorf. Though a fanatic, Jojo is nicknamed Jojo Rabbit after refusing to kill a rabbit to prove his worthiness. Pepped up by Adolf, he returns to prove himself, throwing a Stielhandgranate by himself that explodes at his feet, severely scarring himself and injuring his leg in the process. His mother Rosie insists to the nowdemoted Klenzendorf that Jojo still be included, giving him small tasks like spreading propaganda leaflets.Alone at home one day, Jojo discovers Elsa Korr, a teenage Jewish girl and his late sister Inges former friend, hiding behind the walls of Inges attic bedroom. Jojo is both terrified of and aggressive towards Elsa. The two are left at an impasse, as the revelation of Rosies hiding of Elsa would lead to the execution of all three of them. Inspired by an offhand rant by Klenzendorf, Jojo continues to interact with her to uncover her Jew secrets and make a picture book titled Yoohoo Jew, allowing people to easily recognize her kind. Despite this, he finds himself clashing with innocence, and slowly forming a friendship with her. Elsa is both saddened and amused by Jojos radical beliefs, using surreal antisemitic tropes to challenge his dogmatism. Jojo slowly becomes infatuated with the strongwilled and kind Elsa, frequently forging love letters from her fianc\u00e9 Nathan, and begins questioning his beliefs, causing Adolf to scold him over his diminishing patriotism.Gradually, Rosie is revealed to be part of the German resistance to Nazism, spreading antiNazi messages around town. One day while she is out, the Gestapo come to investigate; Klenzendorf arrives and helps Jojo and Elsa deceive the Gestapo regarding Elsas identity. Later, Jojo finds Rosie has been executed at a gallows in the public square. Devastated, he returns home and tries to stab Elsa before breaking down in tears. Elsa comforts him and also reveals that Jojos lost father has been working against Hitler from abroad. Jojos beliefs on Nazism quickly shift, as he sees the regimes inhumanity. With no money, he begins to scavenge food for them both from waste bins around the city.Following the death of Adolf Hitler, the Allies initiate an offensive on Falkenheim. Weakened, the civilian population including the Jungvolk is pressed into combat service. Jojo hides until it ends with an Allied victory. As a Jungvolk, he is seized by Soviet soldiers alongside Klenzendorf, who comforts him over the death of Rosie, tells him to look after Elsa, and tears off his Jungvolk coat while calling him a Jew so the Soviets do not harm him. After saving Jojo, Klenzendorf is executed by firing squad. Fearing that Elsa will leave him, Jojo tells her Germany won the war. Recognizing her despair, he forges a letter from Nathan, claiming that he and Jojo have figured out a way to smuggle her to Paris. Elsa confesses that Nathan died of tuberculosis the previous year. Jojo tells her he loves her, but she tells him she loves him as a brother. A disheveled Adolf angrily confronts Jojo for siding with Elsa, but Jojo kicks him out a window. Outside, Elsa sees American soldiers and realizes the truth, slapping Jojo in the face for lying. They then dance, now free.",

            "plot": "In a dystopian 2023, Sentinel robots hunt and kill mutants, as well as humans who either possess the genetic potential to have mutant offspring or try to protect them. In Moscow, they attack X-Men survivors Kitty Pryde, Colossus, Blink, Warpath, Bishop, Iceman, and Sunspot. The mutants sacrifice themselves to buy Kitty enough time to send Bishop\\'s consciousness a few days into the past to warn the others of the coming attack and ensure their survival. Having averted the attack, the group retreats to a remote Chinese temple and are joined by Storm, Logan, Charles Xavier, and Erik Lehnsherr. Xavier explains that the Sentinels were originally conceived by Bolivar Trask, a weapons designer whom Raven Darkholme assassinated in 1973. In response, the government captured Raven and experimented on her, using her DNA to create Sentinels capable of adapting to any mutant power. Xavier plans to go back in time to 1973 and prevent Trask\\'s assassination in the hopes of altering the future. However, upon learning that time-traveling too far would kill Xavier, Logan volunteers instead, as his regenerative abilities would allow him to survive. Awakening in 1973, Logan goes to the X-Mansion, learning from Hank McCoy that the school has been closed for years due to the Vietnam War, and Lehnsherr has been imprisoned for assassinating JFK. A young, broken Xavier has turned to alcoholism and frequently uses a serum that allows him to walk, but at the cost of his telepathic abilities. Hoping to reunite with Raven, Xavier agrees to help Logan. They recruit Peter Maximoff, a mutant with superhuman speeds, and break Lehnsherr out of The Pentagon, learning that he was in fact attempting to save JFK, who was also a mutant. Raven discovers Trask has been experimenting on mutants and plots to assassinate him at the Paris Peace Accords, but Xavier, McCoy, and Logan foil her attempt. Lehnsherr attempts to kill Raven, believing this would change the future, so McCoy fights him, allowing Raven to escape but publicly exposing them as mutants. Trask takes advantage of this and convinces President Nixon to authorize the Sentinel program. Lehnsherr retrieves his helmet and secretly takes control of Trask\\'s Sentinel prototypes by infusing them with steel. Returning to the X-Mansion, Xavier abandons the serum and, by reading Logan\\'s mind, communicates with his future self, who inspires him to protect the future between mutants and humans. After Xavier uses his mutant-tracking computer Cerebro to find Raven, he, McCoy, and Logan travel to Washington, D.C. to stop her from assassinating Trask. At a ceremony where Nixon unveils the Sentinels, the three search for Raven. Lehnsherr appears, activates the Sentinels, and barricades the White House by lifting the RFK Stadium over it. During the battle, Lehnsherr impales Logan with a rebar and throws him into the Potomac River. Nixon, Trask, and a disguised Raven retreat to the White House Bunker. However, Lehnsherr rips the bunker out of the building to kill everyone inside. In 2023, the X-Men make their last stand as an onslaught of Sentinels attacks the temple, with most of the mutants perishing while trying to buy more time. In 1973, Raven reveals herself and subdues Lehnsherr with a plastic gun, saving Nixon and his cabinet. Before she can kill Trask, Xavier telepathically convinces her to spare him, leading the public to realize that a mutant saved the President. As a result, the Sentinel program is decommissioned, altering the timeline and erasing the dark future of 2023 from history. The mutants in the past depart separately; Trask is later arrested for selling military secrets to foreign governments. Logan reawakens in 2023 at the X-Mansion to find that Xavier\\'s school is thriving and the X-Men are all alive, including Rogue, Jean Grey, and Scott Summers. Logan asks Xavier for information about modern history from 1973 to the present. Upon realizing that the Logan from the original timeline has returned, Xavier assents. Back in 1973, Logan is rescued by Raven, having disguised herself as Major William Stryker. In a post-credits scene set in ancient Egypt, a crowd chants to En Sabah Nur, who telekinetically elevates rocks to build pyramids as his Four Horsemen observe from afar.",

            "plot": "In 2015, an alien race known as Mimics lands in Germany and swiftly conquers much of continental Europe, killing millions. By 2020, humanity has formed a global military alliance, the United Defense Force UDF, to combat the Mimics. However, victory remained elusive until the recent Battle of Verdun, which was secured by the celebrated war hero Sergeant Rita Vrataski. In Britain, the UDF masses forces for a major invasion of France. General Brigham orders public affairs officer Major William Cage to cover the offensive from the frontline, but the inexperienced and cowardly Cage attempts to blackmail Brigham into rescinding the order. Brigham has Cage arrested, demoted to Private and sent to the military base at Heathrow Airport to join the invasion as infantry. He is assigned to Master Sergeant Farell and the misfit J-Squad, who dislike and belittle him. The following day, the invasion forces land on a French beach but are ambushed and massacred by Mimics. Cage uses a Claymore mine to kill a larger Alpha Mimic, becoming covered in its blood and mortally wounding himself in the ensuing explosion. Cage suddenly awakens at Heathrow, finding he is reliving the previous morning. He makes failed attempts to warn against the invasion and experiences multiple loops in which he dies on the beach and awakens at Heathrow, his battlefield knowledge and skills increasing with each loop. He tries to save Vrataskis life so she can lead them but, after recognizing his apparent prescience, she allows herself to die, ordering Cage to find her on his next loop. Cage quickly convinces Vrataski of the reset because she gained the same power after exposure to an Alphas blood. Her loops enabled her, an initially inexperienced soldier, to win at Verdun, but a later blood transfusion removed the power. Vrataski takes Cage to Mimic expert Dr. Carter, who explains the creatures are a superorganism controlled by a single, gigantic Omega Mimic. Whenever the Alpha Mimics are killed, the Omega restarts a loop and adjusts its tactics until the Mimics win. Vrataski realizes the Mimics allowed the UDF victory at Verdun to make them overconfident in their new mech-suits and lure them into overcommitting their forces in retaking Europe, allowing the Mimics to exterminate most of the resistance. Cage spends many loops training with Vrataski so they can reach the Omega, but he begins to care for her and struggles after seeing her repeatedly die. He experiences a vision of the Omega concealed in a German dam, and he and Vrataski seek it out. During the journey, the pair bond, but Vrataski remains distant, having seen someone she cared about die hundreds of times at Verdun. She eventually determines that this is not the first loop in which they approached the Omega. Cage reveals that she always dies before reaching the dam, regardless of his actions, and he is unwilling to kill the Omega and end the loops if she will remain dead. Upset, Vrataski attempts to leave but is killed by a Mimic. Despondent, during the next loop, Cage travels to the dam alone. He learns the vision was a trap and is ambushed by an Alpha, but Cage drowns before it can remove his power. To find the Omega, Cage and Vrataski sneak into General Brighams office and pressure him into handing over a prototype transponder designed by Carter. Having used it to locate the Omega beneath the Louvre Pyramid in Paris, Cage is knocked unconscious during their escape and given a blood transfusion for his injuries, removing his power. Vrataski frees Cage, and he uses his detailed knowledge of J-Squad to convince them to help destroy the Omega. They fly to Paris, where the squad members sacrifice themselves to ensure Cage and Vrataski reach the Louvre. Cornered by an Alpha, Vrataski kisses Cage, lamenting that she does not have more time to get to know him. The Alpha kills Vrataski and mortally wounds Cage, but he drops several grenades that destroy the Omega and bathe him in its blood. Cage awakens days earlier to a news announcement that all Mimics are dead following a mysterious energy surge in Paris. Cage returns to Heathrow and finds Vrataski. Oblivious to his identity, she inquires what he wants; Cage smiles.",

            "plot": "In a nursing home, elderly Irish-American World War II veteran Frank Sheeran recounts his time as a hitman for the Italian-American Mafia.In 1950s Philadelphia, Sheeran works as a union delivery truck driver, where he starts selling some of the meat shipments to a local Philadelphia Italian-American gangster known as Skinny Razor, a member of the Philadelphia crime family headed by Angelo Bruno. After the delivery company accuses Sheeran of theft, union lawyer Bill Bufalino gets the case dismissed when Sheeran refuses to name his customers to the judge.Bill introduces Sheeran to his cousin Russell Bufalino, head of his namesake crime family in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Sheeran begins to carry out jobs for him, as well as members of the South Philadelphia underworld, including painting houses, a euphemism for contract killing.Sheeran is soon introduced to Jimmy Hoffa, head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, who has financial ties with the Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family. He is struggling to deal with fellow rising Teamster Anthony Provenzano, in addition to mounting pressure from the federal government. Hoffa becomes close with Sheeran and his family, especially his daughter Peggy; in turn Sheeran becomes his chief bodyguard.After the 1960 election of John F. Kennedy, Bufalino is thrilled while Hoffa is furious. Kennedy\\'s brother, Robert F. Kennedy, whom he appointed Attorney General, forms a Get Hoffa squad to bring down Hoffa, who is eventually arrested and convicted in 1964 for jury tampering.While Hoffa is in prison, his replacement as Teamsters president, Frank Fitzsimmons, misuses the union\\'s pension fund and gives interest-free loans to the Mafia. Hoffa\\'s relationship with Tony Pro, himself arrested for extortion, also deteriorates beyond repair when Hoffa refuses to help restore his forfeited pension. Hoffa\\'s sentence is commuted by President Richard Nixon in 1971, although he is forbidden from partaking in any Teamsters activities until 1980.Despite his parole terms, Hoffa undertakes a plan to reclaim his power atop the Teamsters. His growing disrespect for other Teamster leaders and his intention to separate the union from the Mafia begin to worry Russell. During a dinner in Sheeran\\'s honor in October 1973, Russell pleads Sheeran to confront Hoffa and warn him that the heads of the crime families are displeased with his behavior. Hoffa then informs Sheeran that he knows things that Russell and the dons of other families are unaware of and claims that what he knows makes him untouchable, for if anything ever happened to him, they would all end up in prison.In 1975, while on their way to the wedding of Bill\\'s daughter, Russell reluctantly informs Sheeran that the dons have become fed up with Hoffa and have sanctioned his murder. Russell further informs Sheeran that he must serve as the triggerman, knowing he might otherwise try to warn or save Hoffa. The two drive to a private airport where Sheeran boards a plane to Detroit.Hoffa, who had scheduled a meeting at a local restaurant with Tony Pro and Anthony Giacalone, is surprised to see Sheeran arriving late, with Hoffa\\'s unsuspecting foster son Chuckie OBrien and loan shark Sally Bugs. They tell Hoffa the meeting was moved to a house where Tony Pro and Russell are waiting, so Sheeran is to drive him over there. Entering the house, Hoffa realizes it is empty and that he has been set up. He turns around to leave, at which point Sheeran shoots him dead at point-blank range and leaves the gun on his body by the entrance. After Sheeran departs, two other mobsters wrap up the body and cremate it in secret.Invoking their Fifth Amendment rights in a grand jury investigation into Hoffa\\'s disappearance, Sheeran, Russell, Tony Pro, and others are eventually convicted and incarcerated on various charges unrelated to Hoffa\\'s murder and die one by one in prison.Sheeran is eventually released and placed in a nursing home. He tries to reconcile with his alienated daughters. Peggy, however, suspecting his involvement in Hoffa\\'s disappearance has since severed all contact with him. Sheeran begins seeing a Catholic priest assigned to the nursing home, who assured him an overall absolution for whatever crimes committed or denied over his lifetime. As the priest leaves, Sheeran asks him to leave the door slightly ajar, emulating one of Hoffa\\'s safety habits.",

            "plot": "Carrying out orders, inexperienced hitman Ray shoots a priest during confession, but accidentally kills a young boy who is also in church. He and his mentor Ken are sent to Bruges by their employer Harry, where they are to await further instructions. Ken finds the city beautiful and relaxing, while Ray is bored and hates it. They chance upon a film shoot involving a dwarf actor, which amuses Ray. Ray is attracted to Chlo\u00eb, a local drug dealer moonlighting as a production assistant. He takes her to a restaurant, where he gets into an argument with a Canadian couple mistaking them for Americans and punches them. Chlo\u00eb takes Ray to her apartment where they begin to have sex, but her ex-boyfriend Eirik appears and threatens Ray with a handgun. Ray effortlessly disarms the smalltime criminal and fires the gun, loaded with blanks, in Eriks face, blinding him in one eye. Chlo\u00eb admits that she and Eirik rob tourists, but insists she had told Eirik that Ray was not a target. As Chlo\u00eb drives Eirik to the hospital, Ray pockets the gun and helps himself to a handful of live rounds as well as Chlo\u00ebs stash of drugs. He and Ken spend a debauched night with the dwarf actor, Jimmy, who takes cocaine and rants about a coming war between blacks and whites. Harry calls Ken and orders him to kill Ray, on the principle that killing a child, even accidentally, is unforgivable. With a handgun supplied by Harrys local contact Yuri, Ken tracks Ray to a park and reluctantly prepares to kill him. Ray, however, distraught at his killing of the boy, prepares to kill himself with Eriks loaded gun. Seeing this, Ken stops Ray, informs him of Harrys order and tells him to leave Bruges to have a fresh start. He gives Ray some money and puts him on a train to another city, while confiscating his gun to prevent a further suicide attempt. Ken reports the truth back to Harry, who immediately sets out for Bruges, furious at the insubordination. He picks up a gun at Yuris, and Eirik, Yuris son, learns of his intention. Rays train stops, and the police escort him back to Bruges for attacking the Canadians. Chlo\u00eb bails him out and the two share a drink on the market square beneath the Belfry of Bruges. Harry spots Ken sitting outside a cafe. As the two have drinks, Harry boasts that if he himself had killed a child, he would have immediately taken his own life. Ken argues that Ray is trying to better himself and deserves a chance at redemption. Harry is not convinced. Ken suggests they ascend the bell tower for a shootout away from bystanders. At the top, Ken says he accepts whatever punishment Harry intends. A conflicted Harry cannot bring himself to kill Ken, so he shoots him in the leg as punishment for not killing Ray. Seeing Ray at the square, Eirik climbs the tower to inform Harry, who is helping Ken down the tower. Ken tries to disarm Harry, who shoots Ken in the neck and rushes down. Bleeding heavily, Ken drags himself back to the top of the tower and jumps into the square. Ray rushes to Ken, who warns him of Harrys arrival just before he dies. Harry chases Ray to the hotel; Marie, the pregnant owner, refuses Harry entry, even when he draws his gun. To protect the owner and her unborn child, Harry and Ray agree to continue the chase on the canal. Ray, armed with Eriks loaded gun, jumps onto a passing barge but drops the gun. Harry wounds Ray with a shot from a distance. Ray collapses on the street where Jimmys film is shooting. Harry catches up and repeatedly shoots Ray. One of the bullets hits Jimmy costumed as a schoolboy, blowing his head open. Mistakenly believing that he has killed a child, Harry, despite protest from Ray, kills himself. Ray is carried past Chlo\u00eb, Marie and Eirik into an ambulance. In narration, Ray reflects on the nature of hell, speculating that it is an eternity in the city of Bruges, and recalls that he really, really hoped he would not die.",

            "plot": "Professor John Oldman is packing his belongings onto his truck, preparing to move to a new home. His colleagues show up to give him an impromptu farewell party: Harry, a biologist; Edith, an art history professor and devout Christian; Dan, an anthropologist; Sandy, a historian who is in unrequited love with John; Art, an archaeologist; and his younger student Linda. As John\\'s colleagues press him to explain the reason for his departure, he picks up from a reference to Magdalenian cultures by Dan and slowly, and somewhat reluctantly, reveals that he was born in the Paleolithic period. He states that he has lived for more than 14 millennia, and that he relocates every ten years to keep others from realizing that he does not age. He begins his tale under the guise of a possible science-fiction story, but eventually stops speaking in hypotheticals and begins answering questions from a first-person perspective. His colleagues refuse to believe his story but accept it as a working hypothesis in order to glean his true intentions. John relates he was a Sumerian for 2000 years, later a Babylonian, and eventually went east to become a disciple of the Buddha. He claims to have had a chance to sail with Columbus admitting that at the time he still believed the earth was flat and to have befriended Van Gogh one of whose original paintings he apparently owns, a gift from the artist himself. In the course of the conversation, each guest questions John\\'s story based on knowledge from their own academic specialty. Harry struggles with how biology could allow for the possibility of a human being living for so long. Art, arguably the most skeptical of the group, questions prehistory. He exclaims that all of John\\'s answers, although correct, could have come from any textbook; John rejoins that, like any human, his memory is imperfect and he only sees events from his own narrow, hence not omniscient, perspective. Dr. Will Gruber, a psychiatry professor who arrives at Art\\'s request later that afternoon, questions if John feels guilt for outliving everyone he has ever known and loved. He then threatens John with a gun later revealed to have been unloaded before temporarily leaving.  John then learns from Harry that Will\\'s wife had died the previous day after a long illness.  John chases after Will, expresses his condolences and John rejoins the group. The discussion veers to religion, and John mentions that he does not follow any. Even though he does not necessarily believe in an omnipotent God, he does not discount the possibility of such a being\\'s existence. Pressed by the group, John reluctantly reveals that in trying to take the Buddha\\'s teachings to the west, into the eastern Roman Empire, he became the inspiration for the Jesus story. After this revelation, emotions in the room run high. Edith the representative true believer of the group begins crying. Will, who has returned after saying he drove around and didn\u2019t know where else to go, demands that John end his tale and give the group a sense of closure by admitting it was all a hoax. He threatens to have John involuntarily committed for psychiatric evaluation should he refuse to do so. John appears to ruminate over his response before finally confessing to everyone that his story was a prank. John\\'s friends leave the party with various reactions: Edith is relieved; Harry indicates an open mind; Art never wants to see John again; Will still believes John needs professional help; Sandy and Linda clearly believe John; Dan is heavily implied to believe John. After everyone else but Will and Sandy have left, Will overhears John and Sandy\\'s conversation; which suggests the story could be true after all. John mentions some of the pseudonyms he has used over the years, and Will realizes one in particular was his father\\'s name. He asks John specific questions that only a very close acquaintance could answer. When John answers them all correctly, Will has an emotional breakdown, suffers a heart attack and dies in John\u2019s arms. After the body has been taken away, Sandy realizes that if the story is true this is the first time John has seen one of his grown children die. John wordlessly gets in his truck and starts to drive to an unknown destination. Having reconsidered, he then stops and waits for Sandy, who slowly walks over to the truck.",

He has a special relationship with his father Gervais, but things began to fall apart as Zac\\'s non-masculine ways start to show. Their unique relationship officially ends when Gervais comes home to find Zac dressed in his mother\\'s clothes. Ever since then, he \"had unwittingly declared war on his father\". At the Christmas party in 1975, Zac shotguns a joint with his cousin Brigitte\\'s boyfriend Paul, which sparks Zac\\'s attraction. His friend Michelle tries to kiss him, but Zac stops her with the excuse of protecting their friendship. Later on, he discovers that Brigitte is no longer with Paul. In a moment of spontaneity, Zac runs a red light on his motorcycle, only to be struck by a car and hospitalized. Zac later learns that Brigitte is back with Paul. Zac begins a relationship with Michelle, temporarily relieving Gervais\u2014until he sees Zac stepping out of the car with a male classmate, adjusting his crotch. Angry, Gervais has Zac see a therapist to \"cure\" him of his \"homosexuality\". The therapist\\'s conclusion is that Zac made \"a subconscious deliberate mistake\", intentionally doing it so that Gervais would catch him and find out he was \"gay\". At the Christmas dinner in 1980, Zac and Michelle\\'s relationship has become closer and more physical. His brother Christian announces his engagement. At Christian\\'s wedding reception, Zac and Paul shotgun a joint outside, but are seen by a guest who thought they were kissing. Gervais overhears this gossip, and chaos ensues. Gervais confronts Zac in the pouring rain, and Zac admittedly comes out, yelling that while he was not kissing Paul, he wished he had been. A sobbing, eavesdropping Michelle runs out of hiding, and Gervais tells Zac to leave. Zac flies to Jerusalem. Disgusted with himself after a gay sexual escapade, he walks into the desert and collapses in exhaustion. A Bedouin, who finds Zac, drips water on Zac\\'s face and takes Zac into his care. Zac returns home to find his second eldest brother hospitalized after a heroin overdose; he dies the next day. After the funeral, Gervais hugs Zac emotionally. Ten years after his brother\\'s death, Zac narrates that Gervais \"had become my father once more\", even to the point of allowing his lover into his house.",

At his favourite pub, the Winchester, a heartbroken Shaun gets drunk with his slacker best friend Ed. At home, Shaun and Ed\\'s roommate Pete complains of a bite wound from a mugger and berates Shaun, telling him to stop leaning on Ed and get his life together.The following day, a zombie apocalypse has overwhelmed London. Shaun and Ed do not notice until they encounter two zombies in their garden, whom they beat to death after throwing household implements and Shaun\\'s record collection at them. They devise a plan to rescue Shaun\\'s mother, Barbara, and Liz, and then wait out the crisis at the Winchester. They escape from a now-zombified Pete by stealing his car. They pick up Philip, who has been bitten, and Barbara. Ed deliberately crashes Pete\\'s car so he can drive Philip\\'s Jaguar Series 3. They fetch Liz and her flatmates David and Dianne. Philip reconciles with Shaun before becoming a zombie.Forced to abandon the car and their weapons, they sneak through the neighbourhood and briefly encounter a group led by Shaun\\'s friend Yvonne, with each group member resembling a doppelg\u00e4nger of the other group\\'s members. Shaun defends Barbara from a zombie and impales it with a swingball pole. After imitating zombies to bypass a horde and reach the Winchester, Shaun and Ed argue when Ed answers his mobile phone, attracting the zombies\\' attention. David panics and breaks a window of the Winchester, forcing Shaun to lure the horde away using himself as bait before returning.As the group takes refuge inside the Winchester, Shaun discovers that the zombies followed him, and Ed inadvertently attracts them by playing on the pub\\'s slot machine. While fighting the pub\\'s zombified owner, Shaun discovers that the Winchester rifle above the bar is functional, which he had previously debated with Ed. Barbara reveals she was bitten and dies after giving Liz and Shaun\\'s relationship her approval. David attempts to shoot Barbara, but Shaun stops him, accusing David of hating him and being in love with Liz. David denies this, but Dianne admits she knows it is true. Barbara becomes a zombie, forcing a distraught Shaun to shoot her, and further fighting with David ensues.The zombies break through a window of the pub and pull David out, devouring him alive. In a foolish and senseless attempt to save the doomed David, Dianne opens the doors to the pub and rushes into the horde of zombies using David\\'s severed leg as a weapon. With the doors now open, zombies pour into the bar. The zombified Pete reappears in the horde and is shot by Shaun after biting Ed. Shaun, Liz, and Ed take cover behind the bar; Shaun sets the bar on fire with alcohol to serve as a barrier. The three take refuge in the cellar, where they realise they only have two bullets left. Shaun and Liz contemplate suicide while Ed volunteers to sacrifice himself. Upon discovering a small lift for kegs that opens onto the street, Shaun and Liz exit the pub while Ed buys them time by staying behind with the rifle. Yvonne arrives with the British Army, who gun down the zombies before taking Shaun and Liz to safety.Six months later, civilisation has returned to normal but with the added bonus that the surviving zombies are now used for free labour and entertainment. Liz has moved in with Shaun, who keeps the now-zombified Ed chained up in his garden shed, revealing that Ed is still at least somewhat sentient; the two play video games together in the shed.",

            "plot": "In the year 2027, eighteen years of total human infertility have led to war and global depression, pushing civilization to the brink of collapse as humanity faces extinction. The United Kingdom is one of the few remaining nations with a functioning government, and has become a totalitarian police state in which refugees are arrested and either imprisoned, deported, or executed in concentration camps. Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant refugee-rights group led by Theos estranged wife, Julian Taylor; the pair separated after their sons death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee woman named Kee. Theo obtains the documents from his cousin, a government minister, and agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a larger sum of money. Luke, a Fishes leader, drives Theo, Kee, Julian, and former midwife Miriam towards Canterbury, but an armed gang ambushes them and kills Julian. Luke kills two police officers that try to question them, and the group hides Julians body before heading to a safe house. Kee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant, making her the only known pregnant woman in the world. Julian intended to take her to the Human Project, a secret scientific research group in the Azores dedicated to curing humanitys infertility. Luke becomes the new leader of the Fishes. That night, Theo eavesdrops on a discussion and learns that the Fishes orchestrated Julians death so that Luke could become their leader, while also intending to kill Theo and use Kees baby as a political tool. Theo, Kee, and Miriam escape to the secluded hideaway of Jasper Palmer, Theos friend and a former political cartoonist, whose wife Janice was tortured into catatonia by the British government for her journalism. The group plans to reach the Human Project ship, the Tomorrow, scheduled to arrive offshore at Bexhill, a notorious refugee detention centre. Jasper plans to use Syd, an immigration officer to whom Jasper sells cannabis, to smuggle them into Bexhill as refugees, from where they can take a rowboat and rendezvous with the Tomorrow. The next day, the Fishes discover Jaspers house, forcing the group to flee. Jasper stays behind to stall them; he euthanizes Janice and their pet dog with poison before being murdered by Luke. Theo, Kee, and Miriam meet with Syd, who helps them board a bus to the camp. After Kees water breaks, a guard enters the bus to select people for execution. When he notices Kee hurting, Miriam obstructs the guard and is taken away; Theo fools him into thinking Kee just soiled herself, after which the guard leaves her alone. Entering Bexhill, Theo and Kee meet a Romani woman, Marichka, who provides a room where Kee gives birth to a baby girl. The next day, Syd tells the pair that war has broken out between the British military and the refugees, and that the Fishes have infiltrated the camp. He then reveals that Theo and Kee have a bounty on their heads and attempts to capture them. Theo subdues Syd with Marichkas help and the group briefly take shelter with Marichkas friends. Heading for the rowboat, they are ambushed by the Fishes, who capture Kee and the baby. As British troops attack, Theo tracks the Fishes to an apartment building under heavy fire. Theo confronts Luke, who is killed in an explosion, and Theo escorts Kee and the baby out. Awed by the baby, the British soldiers and Fishes temporarily stop fighting and allow the trio to leave. Marichka leads them to the boat but stays behind as they depart. As British fighter jets conduct airstrikes on Bexhill, Theo and Kee row to the rendezvous point in heavy fog. Theo reveals that he was shot and wounded by Luke earlier; he teaches Kee how to burp her baby, and she tells him she will name the baby girl Dylan, after Theo and Julians lost son. Theo smiles weakly, then loses consciousness as the Tomorrow approaches. As the screen cuts to black, childrens laughter is heard.",

            "plot": "In San Diego 1969, child prodigy William Miller struggles to fit in. His life is further complicated after learning that his widowed collegeprofessor mother Elaine has falsely led him to believe he is twelve years old. William is actually eleven, having started the first grade at five years old, and skipping fifth grade. Strongwilled Elaines strict ban on rock music and her fear of pop culture have a lasting effect on her children, finally driving Williams 18yearold sister Anita to move to San Francisco and become a flight attendant.Four years later in 1973, William, now fifteen, influenced by Anitas secret cache of rock albums, aspires to be a rock journalist, writing freelance articles for underground papers in San Diego. Rock journalist Lester Bangs, impressed with Williams writing, gives him a 35 assignment to review a Black Sabbath concert. William is barred from backstage until the opening band Stillwater arrives and William flatters his way in. Lead guitarist Russell Hammond takes a liking to him and his new acquaintance, veteran groupie Penny Lane, who has taken him under her wing. Despite behaving as stereotypical groupies, Penny insists she and her friends are band aids, a term she invented to describe female fans that are there more for the music than for the rock stars themselves.On seeing Williams article on Black Sabbath, Rolling Stone editor Ben FongTorres hires him to write an article about Stillwater and sends him on the road with the band aboard Doris, Stillwaters aging but beloved bus. William interviews the other band members, but Russell avoids him. Tensions between Russell and lead singer Jeff Bebe become evident when the bands first Tshirt is produced, featuring Russell in full view while the rest of the band is in the shadows. William is jokingly called the enemy by the band as he is a journalist, but he gradually begins to lose his objectivity as he becomes integrated into their inner circle.The record label hires Dennis, a professional manager, to handle problems with venues and promoters. Penny has to leave before the band reaches New York, where Russells girlfriend Leslie will join them. Penny and her three prot\u00e9g\u00e9e band aids are gambled away to another band in a poker game; Penny acts nonchalantly but is devastated. Meanwhile, Dennis charters a small plane so the band can play more gigs.Penny shows up uninvited at the New York restaurant where they are celebrating the news that they are to be featured on the cover of Rolling Stone. Penny is asked to leave after her attempts to get Russells attention are noticed. William chases her to her hotel, where he saves her from overdosing on quaaludes.Flying to a gig the following day, the plane encounters severe weather. Fearing the plane will crash, everyone confesses their secrets, while Jeff and Russells longsimmering conflicts erupt. William confesses his love for Penny after Jeff insults her. The plane lands safely in Tupelo, leaving everyone to ponder the changed atmosphere.William arrives at the Rolling Stone office in San Francisco but has difficulty finishing the article. Seeking help, he calls Lester Bangs who says William got caught up in being part of the band. He says his perceived friendships with them are not real and advises him to be honest and unmerciful. Rollings editors rave over Williams completed article, but Russell lies to the magazines factchecker, claiming most of it is false. Rolling Stone kills the article, crushing William. Anita encounters William in the airport and offers to take him anywhere; he chooses for them to go to San Diego, where their mother Elaine is glad to see them both.Sapphire, one of the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Band Aids, chastises Russell for betraying William. He then calls Penny, wanting to meet with her, but she tricks him by giving him Williams address instead of her own. He arrives and finds himself face to face with Williams mother who, during the tour, scolded him over the phone for his behavior. He apologizes to William and finally gives him an interview. Russell verifies the article to Rolling Stone, which runs it as a cover feature. Penny fulfills her longstanding fantasy to go to Morocco while Stillwater tours again by bus.",

Interested in bringing Eddie into porn, Jack auditions him by watching him have sex with Rollergirl, a porn starlet who always wears skates.After a fight with his mother, Eddie moves in with Jack at his San Fernando Valley home. He gives himself the screen name Dirk Diggler and becomes a star because of his good looks, youthful charisma, and abnormally large penis. His success allows him to buy a new house, an extensive wardrobe, and a competition orange 1977 Chevrolet Corvette. With his friend and co-star Reed Rothchild, Dirk pitches a series of successful action-themed porn films. He works and socializes with others from the porn industry, and they live carefree lifestyles in the late 1970s disco era. While attending a New Year\\'s Eve party at Horner\\'s house on December 31, 1979, assistant director Little Bill discovers his adulterous wife having sex with another man. Bill, tired of being repeatedly cheated on, shoots the pair dead and commits suicide.Dirk and Reed begin using cocaine on a regular basis. Due to his drug use, Dirk finds it increasingly difficult to achieve an erection, falls into violent mood swings, and becomes irritated with Johnny Doe, a rival leading man Jack has recently recruited, and whom Dirk worries will replace him. In 1983, after arguing with Jack, Dirk is fired and takes off with Reed to start a music career along with Scotty, a boom operator who is in love with Dirk. Jack rejects business overtures from Floyd Gondolli, a local theater magnate who insists on cutting costs by shooting on videotape rather than film stock, because Jack believes that video will diminish the quality of his films.After his friend and financier, Colonel James, is incarcerated for possession of child pornography, Jack cooperates with Gondolli but becomes disillusioned with the work he is expected to churn out. One of these projects involves Jack and Rollergirl riding in a limousine, searching for random men for her to have sex with while being taped by a crew. One man recognizes Rollergirl as a former high-school classmate, and after a failed attempt at intercourse, he insults her and Jack.

Buck is the sole survivor and escapes with the money.Having spent most of their money on drugs, Dirk and Reed are unable to pay a recording studio for demo tapes they believe will enable them to become music stars. Desperate for money, Dirk resorts to prostitution but is assaulted and robbed by three men. Dirk, Reed, and their friend Todd Parker attempt to scam local drug dealer Rahad Jackson at his estate by selling him a half-kilo of baking soda disguised as cocaine. Dirk and Reed intend to leave quickly before Rahad\\'s bodyguard inspects it, but a drugged-up and armed Todd attempts to steal more money, as well as some more drugs, from Rahad.

            "plot": "At a Detroit theater showing kung fu films, Alabama Whitman strikes up a conversation with Elvis Presley fanatic Clarence Worley. They later have sex at his downtown apartment. Alabama tearfully confesses that she is a call girl hired by Clarences boss as a birthday present but has fallen in love with him. The two get married the next day at City Hall. An apparition of Elvis visits Clarence and convinces him to kill Alabamas abusive pimp, Drexl Spivey. Going to the brothel where Alabama worked, he shoots and kills Drexl and takes a bag he assumes contains Alabamas belongings. Back at the apartment, he and Alabama discover it contains a large amount of cocaine that Drexl had stolen from two drug pushers. The couple visits Clarences estranged father Clifford, a retired cop, for help. He tells Clarence the police assume Drexls murder is a gang killing committed in revenge for the murdered dealers. After the couple leave for Los Angeles, Clifford is interrogated by Vincenzo Coccotti, consiglieri to mobster Blue Lou Boyle, who had hired Drexl to steal and distribute the cocaine on his behalf. He reveals that the mob knows about Clarences theft since they found his drivers license near Drexls body. Clifford, realizing he will die anyway, mockingly defies Coccotti, who shoots him dead. One of his men then finds a Los Angeles address taped to Clifords refrigerator. In Los Angeles, Clarence and Alabama meet Clarences aspiring actor friend, Dick Ritchie, who introduces him to actor and production assistant Elliot Blitzer. He reluctantly agrees to broker the sale of the drugs to his boss, film producer Lee Donowitz. While Clarence is out buying lunch, Coccottis enforcer Virgil finds Alabama in her motel room and beats her for information. Alabama fights back, stabbing him with a corkscrew, putting nail polish remover in his eyes and using hairspray to set fire to Virgils face before grabbing his sawedoff shotgun, and shooting him to death in a maniacal rage. Clarence tends to Alabamas wounds, and they discuss their future together. Elliot is pulled over for speeding and gets charged when his mistress hits him with a bag of cocaine and spills it on him. To stay out of jail, he agrees to wear a wire and record the drug deal between Clarence and Donowitz for police detectives Dimes and Nicholson. Coccottis men also learn about where the deal will take place from Dicks stoner roommate Floyd. Clarence, Alabama, Dick, and Elliot go to Donowitzs suite at the Ambassador Hotel with the drugs. In the elevator, a suspicious Clarence threatens Elliot at gunpoint but is persuaded by Eliots pleading for mercy. Clarence fabricates a story for Donowitz that the drugs were given to him by a corrupt cop, and he agrees to the sale. Excusing himself to the bathroom, the vision of Elvis reassures him that things are going well. Donowitz and his bodyguards are ambushed by the cops and the mobsters. Elliot reveals himself to be an informant by asking the cops if he could leave, whereupon a shootout erupts. Dick throws the suitcase of drugs into the air, where it gets shredded by gunfire, and flees. Donowitz, his bodyguards, Elliot, the cops, and the mobsters are all killed, and Clarence is wounded as he exits the bathroom. He and Alabama escape with Donowitzs money as more police arrive. They flee to Mexico, where Alabama gives birth to a son, whom they name Elvis.",

Carlito vows to end his unlawful activities but is persuaded to accompany his young cousin Guajiro to a drug deal at an illegal speakeasy. Guajiro's suppliers betray and kill him, forcing Carlito to shoot his way out. Carlito takes Guajiro's $30,000 from the botched deal and uses it to buy a stake in a nightclub that is owned by a gambling addict named Saso, intending to save $75,000 to retire to the Caribbean.Carlito declines several offers for a business partnership with a hot-headed young gangster from the Bronx named Benny Blanco. Carlito also rekindles his romance with his former girlfriend Gail, a ballet dancer who moonlights as a stripper. Dave develops a love interest with Benny's girlfriend Steffie, a waitress at the club. Benny's frustration with Carlito's rejections comes to a head, and he confronts Carlito at his table. Carlito publicly humiliates Benny, who reacts by manhandling Steffie. Fueled by his now-extensive use of alcohol and cocaine, Dave brazenly pulls out a gun and threatens to kill Benny, but Carlito intervenes. Despite being personally threatened by Benny, Carlito lets him go unharmed, a decision that alienates him from his friend and bodyguard Pachanga.Dave, who stole $1 million in a payoff from his client, Mafia boss Anthony Tony T Taglialucci, is coerced into providing his yacht to help Taglialucci break out of the Rikers Island prison barge. Dave begs for Carlito's assistance in the prison break, and Carlito reluctantly agrees. That night, Carlito, Dave and Taglialucci's son Frankie sail to a floating buoy outside of the barge where Taglialucci is waiting. As they pull Taglialucci aboard, Dave impulsively kills him, and Frankie and dumps their bodies in the East River, claiming that they would have killed him anyway. Knowing that mob retaliation is imminent, Carlito immediately severs his ties with Dave and decides to leave town with Gail. The next day, Dave is hospitalized after a mob hitman stabs him several times.The police apprehend Carlito and take him to the office of District Attorney Norwalk, where he learns that Dave has already agreed to perjure himself should Carlito be tried again.

            "plot": "One snowy evening, an elderly woman tells her granddaughter the bedtime story of a young man named Edward, who has scissor blades for hands. Many years earlier, Peg Boggs, a local door-to-door Avon saleswoman, tries to sell at the decrepit Gothic mansion where Edward lives. The creation of an old inventor, Edward is an ageless humanoid. The inventor homeschooled Edward but died from a heart attack before giving Edward hands, leaving him unfinished. Peg finds Edward alone and offers to take him to her home after discovering he is virtually harmless. Peg introduces Edward to her husband Bill, their young son Kevin, and their teenage daughter Kim. Edward falls in love with Kim, despite her initial fear of him. As their neighbors are curious about the new houseguest, the Boggs throw a neighborhood barbecue welcoming him. Most of the neighbors are fascinated by Edward and befriend him, except for the eccentric religious fanatic Esmeralda and Kims supercilious boyfriend Jim. Edward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into topiaries, progressing to grooming dogs and later styling the hair of the neighborhood women. One of the neighbors, Joyce, offers to help Edward open a hair salon so he can support himself. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce him, but scares him away. Joyce lies to the neighborhood women that Edward forced himself on her, wrecking their trust in him. Edwards dream of opening the salon is ruined when the bank refuses him a loan on the grounds that he has no assessment and collateral and is not legally a human. Jealous of Kims attraction to Edward, Jim takes advantage of his naivety by asking him to pick the lock on his parents home so he can steal his fathers electronic goods and sell them to buy a van. Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock, a burglar alarm is triggered. Jim flees and Edward is arrested. The police determine that a lifetime of isolation has left Edward without any common sense or morality; thus, he cannot be criminally charged. Edward nevertheless takes responsibility for the robbery, telling Kim that he did it because she asked him to. Consequently, he is shunned by the entire neighborhood except for the Boggs family. At Christmas, Edward carves an angelic ice sculpture modeled after Kim; the ice shavings are thrown into the air and fall like snow, something that has never happened before in the town. Kim dances in the snowfall. Jim arrives suddenly, calling out to Edward, surprising him and causing him to accidentally cut Kims hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming her, but Kim, disgusted and fed up with Jims jealous behavior towards Edward, breaks up with him. Meanwhile, Edward flees in a rage, destroying his works and scaring Esmeralda until he is calmed by a wandering dog. Kims parents go out to find Edward while she stays behind in case he returns. Edward returns, finding Kim there. She asks him to hold her, but Edward hesitates, afraid of hurting her. Jims drunken friend drives him to Kims house and nearly runs over Kevin, but Edward pushes Kevin to safety while inadvertently cutting him. Witnesses accuse Edward of attacking Kevin; when Jim assaults him, Edward defends himself and injures Jims arm before fleeing back to the inventors mansion. Kim goes to find Edward. Jim obtains a gun, follows her, and shoots at Edward before grabbing a fire poker and beating him. Edward refuses to fight back until he sees Jim strike Kim as she attempts to intervene. Enraged, Edward stabs Jim in the stomach and pushes him from a window of the mansion to his death. Kim confesses her love to Edward and kisses him as they accept that their love can never be fulfilled. As the neighbors gather, Kim convinces them that Jim and Edward killed each other. The elderly woman, revealed to be Kim, finishes telling her granddaughter the story and says that she never saw Edward again, hoping that by staying away Edward would remember her as she was in her youth. She believes he is still alive because it would not be snowing without him. Edward is then seen carving ice sculptures of his experiences with Kim, with the bits of ice floating as snow in the wind.",

            "plot": "The story follows two main characters: Judah Rosenthal, a successful and reputable ophthalmologist, and Clifford Stern, a small-time documentary filmmaker. Judah, an upper class respected family man, is having an affair with flight attendant Dolores Paley. After it becomes clear to her that Judah will not end his marriage, Dolores threatens to disclose the affair to Judahs wife, Miriam. She is also aware of some questionable financial deals Judah made before becoming a wealthy ophthalmologist, which adds to his stress. He confides in a patient, Ben, a rabbi who is rapidly losing his eyesight. Ben advises openness and honesty between Judah and his wife, but Judah does not wish to imperil his marriage. Desperate, Judah turns to his brother, Jack, a gangster, who hires a hitman to kill Dolores. Before her corpse is discovered, Judah retrieves letters and other items from her apartment in order to cover his tracks. Stricken with guilt, Judah turns to the religious teachings he had rejected, believing for the first time that a just God is watching him and passing judgment. Cliff, meanwhile, has been hired by his pompous brotherinlaw, Lester, a successful television producer, to make a documentary celebrating Lesters life and work. Cliff grows to despise him. While filming and mocking the subject, Cliff falls in love with Lesters associate producer, Halley Reed. Despondent over his failing marriage to Lesters sister Wendy, he woos Halley, showing her footage from his ongoing documentary about Professor Louis Levy, a renowned philosopher. He ensures Halley is aware that he is shooting Lesters documentary merely for the money so he can finish his more meaningful project with Levy. Cliff learns that Professor Levy, whom he had been profiling for a documentary centered on his philosophical views and the strength of his celebration of life, has committed suicide, leaving a curt note that only says: Ive gone out the window. When Halley visits to comfort him, he makes a pass at her, which she gently rebuffs, telling him she is not ready for another romance. Cliffs dislike for Lester becomes evident during the first screening of the film. Cliff has maliciously edited the film, which juxtaposes footage of Lester with clownish poses of Benito Mussolini addressing a throng of supporters from a balcony. It also shows Lester yelling at his employees and clumsily making a pass at an attractive young actress. Lester fires him. Adding to Cliffs burdens, Halley leaves for London, where Lester is offering her a producing job; when she returns several months later, Cliff is astounded to discover that she and Lester are engaged. Hearing that Lester sent Halley white roses round the clock, for days while they were in London, Cliff is crestfallen as Halley falling for Lester is his worst fear realized. His last romantic gesture to Halley had been a love letter which he had mostly plagiarized from James Joyce, including references to Dublin. Judah and Cliff meet by happenstance at the wedding of the daughter of Rabbi Ben, who is Cliffs brotherinlaw and Judahs patient. Judah has worked through his guilt and is enjoying life once more; the murder had been blamed on a drifter with a criminal record. He draws Cliff into a supposedly hypothetical discussion that draws upon his moral quandary. Judah says that with time, any crisis will pass; but Cliff morosely claims that very few guys could live with that on their conscience. Judah cheerfully leaves the wedding party with his wife, and Cliff is left sitting alone, dejected. The wedding party continues. Rabbi Ben, who is now blind, shares a dance with his daughter while the voice of Professor Levy is heard, saying that the universe is a dark and indifferent place which human beings fill with love, in the hope that future generations will understand more.",

            "plot": "The story is told in three main arcs, with most of it occurring during a 24month period beginning and ending at Thanksgiving parties, held at The Langham, hosted by Hannah, and her husband, Elliot. Hannah serves as the stalwart hub of the narrative; most of the events of the film connect to her. Elliot becomes infatuated with one of Hannahs sisters, Lee, and eventually begins an affair with her. Elliot attributes his behavior to his discontent with his wifes selfsufficiency and resentment of her emotional strength. Lee has lived for five years with a reclusive artist, Frederick, who is much older. She finds her relationship with Frederick no longer intellectually or sexually stimulating, in spite of or maybe because of Fredericks professed interest in continuing to teach her. She leaves Frederick after admitting to having a dalliance with Elliot. For the remainder of the year between the first and second Thanksgiving gatherings, Elliot and Lee carry on their affair despite Eliots inability to end his marriage to Hannah. Lee finally ends the affair during the second Thanksgiving, explaining that she is finished waiting for him to commit and that she has started dating someone else. Hannahs exhusband Mickey, a television writer, is present mostly in scenes outside of the primary story. Flashbacks reveal that his marriage to Hannah fell apart after they were unable to have children because of his infertility. However, they had twins who are not biologically his, before divorcing. He also went on a disastrous date with Hannahs sister Holly, when they were set up after the divorce. A hypochondriac, he goes to his doctor complaining of hearing loss, and is frightened by the possibility that it might be a brain tumor. When tests prove that he is perfectly healthy, he is initially overjoyed, but then despairs that his life is meaningless. His existential crisis leads to unsatisfying experiments with religious conversion to Catholicism and an interest in Krishna Consciousness. Ultimately, a suicide attempt leads him to find meaning in his life after unexpectedly viewing the Marx Brothers Duck Soup in a movie theater. The revelation that life should be enjoyed, rather than understood, helps to prepare him for a second date with Holly, which this time blossoms into love. Hollys story is the films third main arc. A former cocaine addict, she is an unsuccessful actress who cannot settle on a career. After borrowing money from Hannah, she starts a catering business with April, a friend and fellow actress. Holly and April end up as rivals in auditions for parts in Broadway musicals, as well as for the affections of an architect, David. Holly abandons the catering business after the romance with David fails and decides to try her hand at writing. The career change forces her once again to borrow money from Hannah, a dependency that Holly resents. She writes a script inspired by Hannah and Elliot, which greatly upsets Hannah. It is suggested that much of the script involved personal details of Hannah and Eliots marriage that had been conveyed to Holly through Lee having been transmitted first from Elliot. Although this threatens to expose the affair between Elliot and Lee, Elliot soon disavows disclosing any such details. Holly sets aside her script, and instead writes a story inspired by her own life, which Mickey reads and admires greatly, vowing to help her get it produced and leading to their second date. A minor arc in the film tells part of the story of Norma and Evan. They are the parents of Hannah and her two sisters, and still have acting careers of their own. Their own tumultuous marriage revolves around Normas alcoholism and alleged affairs, but the long-term bond between them is evident in Evans flirtatious anecdotes about Norma while playing piano at the Thanksgiving gatherings. By the time of the films third Thanksgiving, Lee has married a literature professor she met while taking random classes at Columbia University. Hannah and Elliot have reconciled their marriage.

As a 9-year-old boy in 1940, all Ralphie wants for Christmas is a Red Ryder Carbine Action 200-shot Range Model air rifle. Ralphie\\'s desire is continuously rejected, first by his mother, who tells him \"You\\'ll shoot your eye out\". He is later assigned a theme for school about what he wants for Christmas, and he writes about the BB gun. However, he gets it back with a poor grade, and the same warning. Finally, on Christmas Eve, Ralphie sees a disgruntled Santa at Higbee\\'s Department Store, and he expresses his desire, only to be hurriedly brushed off with the same warning. On Christmas morning, Ralphie receives some presents that he enjoys but is disappointed not to find the rifle among them. Ralphie\\'s father (\"The Old Man\") directs him to one last box hidden in the corner, which proves to contain the rifle. Ralphie eagerly hurries outside to try it out, but when he shoots at the metal target he has set up, the BB ricochets and knocks off his glasses. Ralphie accidentally steps on and breaks the glasses while trying to find them; he makes up a cover story about an icicle falling from the roof of the garage and hitting his eye, which fools his mom and keeps him from getting in trouble. That night, Ralphie goes to sleep with the gun by his side, as his adult self reflects that it was the best Christmas present he had ever received or would ever receive. Interspersed with the main story are several loosely related vignettes involving the Parkers",

            "plot": "In Borgo San Giuliano, a village near Rimini, the arrival of fluffy poplar seeds floating on the wind heralds the arrival of spring. As night falls, the inhabitants make their way to the village square for the fogheraccia, a traditional bonfire in which the segavecchia, an effigy of an old woman, is ritually burned. The townspeople play pranks on one another, explode fireworks, cavort with loose women and make lewd noises when the civically minded lawyer lectures on the history of the region. School under Fascism is a tedious cavalcade of dry facts recited by instructors of varying levels of engagement and skill. All Titta and his fellow students can do is goof off or skip class when not called upon to solve math problems or identify obscure historical details. When Titta goes to confession, he manages to avoid telling Don Balosa about his masturbatory activities and attempt to seduce Gradisca, a glamorous older woman, because the priest is more concerned with floral arrangements. Fascist officials come for a tour, and the schoolchildren are required to perform athletic routines for their approval. Titta\\'s friend Ciccio daydreams about being married to his crush, Aldina, by the giant face of Mussolini. Surreptitiously wired into the bell tower of the town church, a gramophone plays a recording of \"The Internationale\", but it is soon shot at and destroyed by gun-crazy Fascists. Owing to his anarchist past, Titta\\'s father Aurelio is brought in for questioning and forced to drink castor oil. He limps home in a nauseous state to be washed by his wife, Miranda. One summer afternoon, the family visits Uncle Teo, Aurelio\\'s brother, confined to an insane asylum. They take him out for a day in the country, but he escapes into a tree, repeatedly yelling, \"Voglio una donna!\" (\"I want a woman!\"). All attempts to bring him down are met with stones that Teo carries in his pockets. A dwarf nun and two orderlies finally arrive on the scene. Marching up the ladder, the nun reprimands Teo, who obediently agrees to return to the asylum. Fall arrives. The town\\'s inhabitants embark in small boats to meet the passage of the SS Rex, the regime\\'s proudest technological achievement. By midnight they have fallen asleep waiting for its arrival. Awakened by a foghorn, they watch in awe as the liner sails past, capsizing their boats in its wake. Titta\\'s grandfather wanders lost in a disorienting fog so thick it seems to smother the house and the autumnal landscape. Walking out to the town\\'s Grand Hotel, Titta and his friends find it boarded up. Like zombies, they waltz on the terrace with imaginary female partners enveloped in the fog. The annual car race provides the occasion for Titta to daydream of winning the grand prize, Gradisca. One evening he visits the buxom tobacconist at closing time. She becomes aroused when he demonstrates he is strong enough to lift her, but is annoyed when he becomes overwhelmed as she presses her breasts into his face. She gives him a cigarette then coldly sends him home. Winter brings with it record snowfall. Miranda nurses a sick Titta to health, then as spring arrives again, dies of an illness herself. Titta is devastated. Later, the village attends the reception for Gradisca\\'s marriage to a Fascist officer. As Gradisca drives off with her Carabiniere, someone notices that Titta has gone too.",

He stages elaborate fake suicides, attends funerals, and drives a hearse, all to the chagrin of his self-obsessed, wealthy socialite mother. His mother sends Harold to a psychoanalyst, sets him up with blind dates, and buys him a luxury car, all schemes he subverts in his own way. Harold meets 79-year-old Maude one day while at a random strangers funeral Mass, and discovers that they share a hobby. Harold is entranced by Maudes quirky outlook on life, which is bright and delightfully carefree in contrast to his morbid demeanor. Maude lives in a decommissioned railroad car and thinks nothing of breaking the law; she is quite skilled at stealing cars and will swiftly uproot an ailing tree in a city sidewalk to replant it in the forest. She and Harold form a bond and Maude shows Harold the pleasures of art and music, and teaches him how to make the most of his time on earth. Meanwhile, Harolds mother is determined, against Harolds wishes, to find him a wife. One by one, Harold frightens and horrifies each of his appointed computer dates, by appearing to commit gruesome acts, including selfimmolation, selfmutilation, and seppuku. His mother attempts to enlist him in the military by sending Harold to his uncle, who lost an arm serving under General MacArthur in World War II, but Harold deters the recruitment by staging a scene where Maude poses as a pacifist protester and Harold seemingly murders her out of militarist fanaticism. As Harold and Maude grow closer, their friendship blossoms into a romance. Holding her hand, Harold discovers a number tattooed on her forearm, indicating Maude survived the Nazi death camps. Harold announces that he will marry Maude, resulting in disgusted outbursts from his family, analyst, and priest. Unbeknownst to Harold, Maude has been planning to end her own life on her 80th birthday. Maudes birthday arrives, and Harold throws a surprise party for her. As the pair dance, Maude tells Harold that she couldnt imagine a lovelier farewell. When Maude reveals that she has taken an overdose of sleeping pills and will be dead by midnight, Harold rushes Maude to the hospital. Devastated after learning of Maudes death, Harold speeds down a country road and sends his car off a seaside cliff. Following the crash, Harold stands calmly atop the cliff, holding his banjo. After gazing down at the wreckage, he plucks the banjo strings and dances away to If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out.",

            "plot": "In 1913 Texas, Pike Bishop, the leader of a gang of aging outlaws, seeks to retire after a final robbery of silver from a railroad payroll office. Corrupt railroad agent Pat Harrigan has hired a posse of bounty hunters led by Pikes former partner Deke Thornton, who ambush and kill more than half of Bishops gang in a bloody shootout, which also kills many innocent bystanders as Pike uses a serendipitous temperance union parade to shield their getaway. Pike rides off with the only survivors: his close friend Dutch Engstrom, brothers Lyle and Tector Gorch, the inexperienced Angel, and a fifth man blinded and mortally wounded by buckshot, who Pike mercy-kills. The loot from the robbery turns out to be worthless steel washers planted by Harrigan. Needing money, they head for Mexico accompanied by the cantankerous Freddie Sykes and cross the Rio Grande to the rural village where Angel was born. The village elder warns them about General Mapache, a vicious Huertista officer in the Mexican Federal Army, who has been stealing food and animals from local villages to support his campaign against the forces of Pancho Villa. Pikes gang ask the general for work at his headquarters in the town of Agua Verde. Angel spots his former lover Teresa in Mapaches arms and shoots her dead, angering the general and nearly getting them killed, but Pike defuses the situation. Mapache offers gold to the gang to rob a U.S. Army train so Mapache can resupply his armys dwindling stocks of ammunition and provide samples of American weapons to his German military adviser Commander Mohr. Angel gives his share of the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and ammunition to a band of peasant rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely as planned until Thortons posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed and chases them to the Mexican border. The robbers blow up a trestle bridge spanning the Rio Grande as the posse tries to cross, dumping the entire posse into the river, but the exhausted posse continues their pursuit. Pike, anticipating that Mapache might double-cross him, hides the goods and has his men sell them to Mapache in separate amounts. However, Mapache learns from Teresas mother that Angel stole some of the weapons and reveals this as Angel and Dutch deliver the last of the weapons. Angel desperately tries to escape, only to be captured and beaten. Mapache lets Dutch go after he states that Angel is a thief who deserves to be punished, and Dutch then tells Pike and the others what happened. Sykes is wounded by Thortons posse while securing spare horses. Dutch criticizes Thornton for working with the railroad, but Pike says Thornton gave his word to the railroad and must see it through. Dutch angrily declares, That aint what counts, its who you give it to. Pike and the gang bury most of the gold and return to Agua Verde, where the townspeople and soldiers are drunkenly celebrating the weapons sale and Mapache is dragging Angel through town on a rope tied to the back of his car. Mapache refuses to sell Angel back to the gang, and after a period of reflection while visiting a brothel, Pike and the others arm themselves to rescue their friend by force. Mapache initially agrees to release Angel, only to cut his throat at the last second. The gang instantly opens fire and guns down the general. While the nearby soldiers are frozen in shock, Pike calmly takes aim and kills Mohr. This begins a bloody gunfight that kills Pike, Dutch, the remaining gang members, Mohrs aide, every member of Mapaches staff, and most of the assembled troops. Thornton arrives and finds Pike already dead. Thornton finds a loaded revolver on Pikes belt and takes it as a sign that the days of men like him are over. Feeling outdated and tired, Thornton allows the remaining posse members to greedily strip Pike and his men of their possessions before taking them back to Texas for the bounty, while he stays behind. After some time, Sykes arrives with the elder from Angels village and a band of rebels, indicating that they caught up with the bounty hunters, avenged the gangs deaths, and buried them properly. Sykes invites Thornton to join the coming revolution against the Mexican government. Thornton smiles and rides off with them.",

She flees to a nearby farmhouse but finds the resident's corpse lying half-eaten on the stairs. A growing horde of ghouls soon surround the house as a stranger, Ben, arrives and initially mistakes Barbra for the homeowner. After driving back several ghouls, he boards the windows and doors. While searching the home for supplies, he locates a leveraction rifle.A nearly catatonic Barbra is surprised to find people already taking shelter in the home's cellar. Harry, his wife Helen, and their young daughter Karen fled there after a group of the same monsters overturned their car and bit Karen on the arm, leaving her seriously ill. A couple, Tom and Judy, took shelter after hearing an emergency broadcast about a series of brutal killings. Tom and Ben secure the farmhouse while Harry protests that it is unsafe aboveground before returning to the cellar. Ghouls continue to besiege the farmhouse in increasing numbers.The refugees listen to radio and television reports of an army of cannibalistic corpses committing mass murder across the East Coast of the United States and of the posses of armed men patrolling the countryside to exterminate the living dead. Reports confirm that the ghouls can die again from heavy blows to the head, bullets to the brain, or being burned. Various rescue centers offer refuge and safety, and scientists theorize that radiation from an exploding space probe returning from Venus caused the reanimations.Ben devises a plan to obtain medical supplies for Karen and transport the group to a rescue center by refueling his truck at a pump on the farm. Ben, Tom, and Judy drive there together, holding the ghouls off with torches and Molotov cocktails. However, the gas from the pump spills and causes the truck to catch fire and explode, killing Tom and Judy. Ben returns and breaks down the door when Harry does not let him in.The remaining survivors attempt to figure a way out. They pause their discussion to watch the 3 a.m. news update until the power cuts out. The ghouls soon break through the doors and windows of the unlit home. In the chaos, Harry grabs Ben's gun but is disarmed and shot by Ben. Harry staggers down to the cellar and dies next to his daughter.Karen dies from her injuries, becomes a ghoul, and eats her father's remains. She stabs her mother to death with a masonry trowel. Barbra tries to help Ben keep the ghouls out, but a reanimated Johnny drags her away. As the horde breaks in, Ben takes refuge in the cellar, where he shoots Harry's and Helen's ghouls.In the morning, an armed posse arrives to dispatch the remaining ghouls. Awoken by their gunfire and sirens, Ben emerges from the cellar, but they shoot him, mistaking Ben for a ghoul. His body is thrown onto a bonfire and burned with the rest of the ghouls.",

            "plot": "A series of closeups of the backs and arms of a man and woman embracing, amidst falling ash and then covered in sweat. In voiceover, the woman recounts the aftermath of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima that she has seen on her trip to the city, while newsreel and fictional footage of victims, protests, war memorials, and the streets and buildings of modern Hiroshima are shown. The man calmly says the woman has not seen anything, nor does she know what it is to forget. He is from Hiroshima and his family died in the bombing while he was off fighting in the war, and the woman is a French actress who is in the city to make an anti-war film. In the morning, the woman watches the man sleep. His twitching hand reminds her of her first love, a soldier whose hand moved similarly as he lay dying. The Japanese man wakes, and it becomes clear he and the woman met the previous night at a caf\u00e9. She learns he is an architect who is involved in politics. They discuss the bombing and the end of the war, and he is enchanted by the word Nevers, her hometown, to which she never wants to return. The man says he would like to see the woman again, but she says she is flying back to Paris the next day. Neither this nor the revelation that she has children change how he feels, but she, though torn, repeatedly declines to arrange another meeting. The man visits the woman at the filming location, and she is happy to see him. He takes her back to his house. She asks if he lives alone, and he replies that his wife is out of town for a few days. They both say they are happy in their marriages, though they have had casual affairs before, and make love again. After deciding to spend the woman\\'s remaining time in Hiroshima together, they go to a tea room, where the man asks the woman to tell him more about Nevers and her life there. Intercut with flashbacks, she tells how she and an occupying German soldier fell in love and planned to elope to Bavaria before he was shot while waiting for her on the day Nevers was liberated, how she stayed with him while he died over the next two days, how the villagers shaved her head when they found out about the relationship, and how her parents locked her alternately in her room and the cellar while her hair grew out and she came out of her madness and then sent her away to Paris just before Hiroshima was bombed. She tries to convey the pain she feels about forgetting the German and their love, and indicates she has been trying to keep her distance from the Japanese man because she does not want any more such heartbreak. The man is elated when he learns the woman never told her husband about the German, but when they leave the tea room, she tells him to go away and that they will probably never see each other again. In her hotel room, she feels guilty about telling the man about the German, but decides to stay in Hiroshima. She goes back to the now-closed tea room, and the man finds her and asks her to stay. She weakly says she will, but then tells him again to go away. They walk around the city, together and separately, images of Hiroshima alternating with images of Nevers. The woman goes to a train station, where she lets go of some of her issues surrounding her first love and decides she might like to visit Nevers. She takes a cab to a nightclub, the man following. The place is nearly empty and they sit apart. As the sun rises, a Japanese man sits by the woman and hits on her in English. Back in the woman\\'s hotel room, the architect knocks at the door. She lets him in and yells that she is already starting to forget him, but abruptly calms and says his name is Hiroshima. He responds that it is, and her name is Nevers.",

            "plot": "In Hadleyville, a small town in New Mexico Territory, Marshal Will Kane, newly married to Amy Fowler, prepares to retire. The happy couple will soon depart to raise a family and run a store in another town. However, word arrives that Frank Miller, a vicious outlaw whom Kane sent to prison, has been released and will arrive by the noon train, one day ahead of the new marshal. Miller\\'s gang\u2014his younger brother Ben, Jack Colby, and Jim Pierce\u2014wait at the station. For Amy, a devout Quaker and pacifist, the solution is simple\u2014leave town before Miller arrives\u2014but Kane\\'s sense of duty and honor make him stay. Besides, he says, Miller and his gang would hunt him down anyway. Amy gives Kane an ultimatum: she is leaving on the noon train, with or without him. Kane visits old friends and allies, but none can or will help. Judge Percy Mettrick, who sentenced Miller, flees and urges Kane to do the same. Harvey Pell, Kane\\'s young deputy, is bitter that Kane did not recommend him as his successor; he says he will stand with Kane only if Kane \"puts the word in\" for him with the city fathers. When Kane refuses, Pell turns in his badge and pistol. Kane\\'s efforts to round up a posse at Ram\u00edrez\\'s Saloon and the church are met with fear and hostility. Some townspeople, worried that a gunfight would damage the town\\'s reputation, urge Kane to avoid the confrontation. Some are Miller\\'s friends, but others resent that Kane cleaned up the town in the first place. Others believe that Kane\\'s fight is not the town\\'s responsibility. Sam Fuller hides in his house, forcing his wife Mildred to tell Kane he is not home. Jimmy offers to help, but he is blind in one eye, sweating, and unsteady. The mayor encourages Kane to leave town. Martin Howe, Kane\\'s predecessor, is too old and arthritic. Herb Baker agrees to be deputized, but backs out when he realizes he is the only volunteer. One last offer of help comes from 14-year-old Johnny. Kane admires his courage, but refuses his aid. While waiting at the hotel for the train, Amy confronts Helen Ram\u00edrez, who was once Miller\\'s lover, then Kane\\'s, then Pell\\'s. Amy believes the reason Kane refuses to leave town is because he wants to protect Helen, but Helen reveals there is no lingering attachment on Kane\\'s part and she, too, is leaving. When Helen questions why Amy will not stay with Kane, Amy explains that both her brother and father were gunned down by criminals, a tragedy that converted her to Quakerism. Helen nonetheless chides Amy for not standing by her husband in his hour of need, saying that if she was in Amy\\'s place, she would take up a gun and fight alongside Kane. Pell saddles a horse and tries to persuade Kane to take it. They end up in a fist fight. After knocking Pell senseless, Kane returns to his office to write out his will. As the clock ticks toward noon, Kane goes into the street to face Miller and his gang. Amy and Helen ride by on a wagon, bound for the train. The train arrives, and Miller steps off as the two ladies board. Kane walks down the deserted main street alone. He manages to kill Ben Miller in the opening salvo. Just before the train departs, Amy hears the gunfire and runs back to town. Kane takes refuge in a stable, and Colby is killed when he comes in after him. Miller sets fire to the stable to flush him out. Kane frees the horses and tries to escape on one, only to be shot off and cornered. Despite her religious beliefs, Amy picks up Pell\\'s pistol and shoots Pierce from behind, leaving only Frank Miller, who grabs Amy as a human shield to force Kane into the open. When Amy claws Miller\\'s face, he pushes her to the ground and Kane shoots him dead. The couple embrace. As the townspeople emerge, Kane smiles at Johnny, but looks angrily at the rest of the crowd. He drops his marshal\\'s star to the street and departs with Amy.",

            "plot": "On the morning of the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade, the man playing Santa Claus is drunk. An old man named Kris Kringle discovers this and indignantly complains to event director Doris Walker. Noticing that Kris resembles Santa Claus, Doris persuades Kris to play Santa in the parade himself. Kris is well received and is subsequently hired to play Santa at Macys New York City store on 34th Street. The toy department head, Mr. Shellhammer, instructs Kris to recommend overstocked items to undecided shoppers. Instead, Kris directs a woman to another store to fulfill her sons Christmas request. Impressed, the woman informs Shellhammer that she will become a loyal Macys customer. Attorney Fred Gailey, Doriss neighbor, takes Doriss daughter, Susan, to see Santa. After hearing Kris speak Dutch to an orphan girl from the Netherlands, Susan is amazed. Doris, who has raised Susan to not believe in fairy tales, asks Kris to tell Susan the truth, but Kris insists that he really is Santa Claus. Worried, Doris decides to fire Kris, but R. H. Macy, the stores owner, promises bonuses to Doris and Shellhammer because of the positive publicity Kris has given the store. To alleviate Doriss misgivings, Shellhammer suggests Granville Sawyer administer a psychological evaluation. After doing so, Sawyer is convinced Kris has a grandiose delusion and insists for Kris to be fired and put in a mental institution. Meanwhile, Susan shows Kris a magazine photo of her dream house and tells him she wants it for Christmas. Kris promises to do his best. In the company cafeteria, young employee Alfred tells Kris that Sawyer convinced him that he is unstable simply because he enjoys dressing as Santa Claus. Kris immediately confronts Sawyer, eventually striking him on the head with an umbrella. Sawyer, outraged, brings Kris to Bellevue Hospital. Tricked into cooperating and believing Doris to be in on the deception, Kris deliberately fails his examination and is recommended for permanent commitment. However, Fred persuades Kris not to give up and represents him in court. At a hearing before Judge Henry X. Harper, District Attorney Thomas Mara gets Kris to assert that he is Santa Claus and rests his case, asking Harper to rule that Santa does not exist. In private, Harpers political adviser, Charlie Halloran, warns him that doing so would be disastrous for his upcoming reelection bid. Harper buys time by hearing further evidence. Fred calls Macy as a witness and gets him to admit that he believes Santa Claus exists. Macy then fires Sawyer. Next, Fred calls Maras own young son, who testifies that his father told him that Santa is real. Mara concedes the point, but goes on to demand that Fred prove that Kris is the one and only Santa Claus on the basis of a competent authority by the following day. Meanwhile, Susan writes Kris a letter to cheer him up, which Doris also signs. When a New York Post Office mail sorter sees Susans letter, addressed to Kris at the New York courthouse, he suggests delivering all of the dead letters addressed to Santa Claus to Kris and freeing up storage space. As court resumes, Fred is informed of the mail delivery; he argues that the Post Office, a branch of the U.S. federal government, has acknowledged that Kris is the one and only Santa Claus by delivering the letters. When the judge insists on seeing the letters, postal employees bring multiple heavy bags of letters to Harpers desk. Harper dismisses the case. Kris invites Fred, Doris and Susan to a Christmas Day celebration at the facility where he resides, the Brooks Memorial Home for the Aged. Susan is sad because what she asked for is not under the tree and loses faith in Kris when he admits he was unable to get her the house she wanted. However, after Kris offers Fred and Doris a route home that avoids traffic, Susan sees her dream house with a For Sale sign out front; Susan becomes ecstatic and runs through the house. Fred learns that Doris had encouraged Susan to have faith and suggests they get married and purchase the house. Fred and Doris then see a cane in the house that looks like a cane Kris owns. They both begin to ponder whether Kris really is Santa Claus.",

            "plot": "Walter Burns, the hardboiled editor for The Morning Post of Chicago, learns his exwife and former star reporter, Hildegard Hildy Johnson, is about to marry insurance man Bruce Baldwin and settle down as a housewife in Albany. Walter, determined to sabotage these plans, entices a reluctant Hildy to cover one last story: the execution of Earl Williams, a white bookkeeper portrayed as a shy, confused man, convicted of murdering a black policeman. Walter is committed to stop the execution, claiming it is a political move to get the Mayor reelected, since the victim is of color. Hildy agrees on the condition that Walter buy a 100000 life insurance policy from Bruce so he can receive a 1000 commission. In the meantime, she bribes the warden to let her interview Williams in jail. She induces the convicted man to make a compelling argument in his defense, that he was not fully aware of his own actions when he shot the police officer. Walter does everything he can to keep Hildy from marrying Bruce, eventually accusing her fianc\u00e9 of stealing a watch, forcing Hildy to bail him out of jail. Exasperated, Hildy quits, but when the convicted man escapes, her journalistic instincts take over. Walter frames Bruce again, and he is immediately sent back to jail. Hildy realizes that Walter is behind the shenanigans, but she prioritizes covering the rapidly escalating Williams story over bailing Bruce out again. On the run, Williams sneaks into the deserted press room and holds Hildy at gunpoint; the lure of a big scoop proves too tempting for her to resist. Williams girlfriend Mollie comes looking for him. When the other reporters return, Hildy hides the fugitive in a rolltop desk. Mrs. Baldwin, Hildy\\'s future motherinlaw, enters and berates her for the way she is treating Bruce. Upon being harassed for Williams whereabouts by the reporters, Mollie jumps out of the window. The reporters rush out, saving Williams from being found. Walter arrives and has his henchman Louie kidnap Mrs. Baldwin. Bruce comes into the press room, having wired Albany for his bail and asking for his mothers whereabouts. Hildy is so consumed with writing the story that she hardly notices; Bruce realizes his cause is hopeless and leaves. A disheveled Louie returns, revealing that he had hit a police car while driving away with Mrs. Baldwin and is unsure if she survived in the accident. Meanwhile, the mayor and sheriff, portrayed as crooked, are informed that the reds in the city are gathering in support of the execution. The sheriff has no issues against the reds, so he suggests to try to get closer to such voters; the Mayor explains that all that is needed is their approval to keep their jobs in the upcoming election. So, when a messenger brings them a reprieve from the governor, they try to bribe the man to go away and return later, after it is too late. After Williams is discovered in the desk, Walter and Hildy are handcuffed by the sheriff. However, the messenger returns with the reprieve, just in time to save Williams from the gallows. Walter uses the messengers statements to blackmail the mayor and sheriff into releasing him and Hildy. Hildy receives a call from Bruce, again in jail because of counterfeit money that was unknowingly transferred to him by Hildy from Walter. Hildy breaks down and admits to Walter that she was afraid that he was going to let her marry Bruce without a fight. After bailing Bruce out of jail again, Walter asks Hildy to remarry him and promises to take her on the honeymoon they never had in Niagara Falls. Then Walter learns that there is a strike in Albany, which is on the way to Niagara Falls. Hildy agrees to honeymoon in Albany, accepting that Walter will never change.",

            "plot": "Richard, the Norman King of England, is taken captive in 1191 by Duke Leopold while returning from the Third Crusade. Richards treacherous brother Prince John, aided by fellow Norman Sir Guy of Gisbourne, names himself regent of England, increasing the Saxons taxes under the pretense of gathering a ransom for Richard. The Normans exploit and oppress the Saxons. Sir Robin of Locksley, a Saxon noble, opposes the brutality and rescues Much the Millers Son from being executed for poaching, earning Gisbournes ire. Robin later confronts Prince John at a Nottingham Castle banquet, telling the assembled guests that he regards Johns declaring himself regent as treason. John orders Robins execution, but he escapes and flees with Much and Will Scarlet into Sherwood Forest. John seizes Robins lands and names him outlaw. Much is sent to recruit men to join their band. Robin and Will encounter John the Little on a log bridge, and after a quarterstaff contest, welcome him into their ranks. Dozens more men join Robins band, swearing an oath to despoil the rich while aiding the poor, to fight injustice, and to show courtesy to all oppressed. They start a war against John and Gisbourne, dispatching those who abuse their power. Robins band encounters the rotund Friar Tuck, a renowned swordsman. Tuck joins the band and assists in capturing a company of Normans transporting a shipment of gathered taxes. In the company are Gisbourne, the cowardly Sheriff of Nottingham, and King Richards ward Lady Marian. After their capture, the men are humiliated at a celebratory woodland banquet, with Marian given a seat of honor. Initially scornful, she comes to share Robins views after he shows her examples of Norman brutality against the Saxons. Robin sends the convoy back to Nottingham Castle, telling them that they have Marians presence to thank for their lives being spared. Having noted Robins focus on Marian during the Sherwood banquet, the sheriff suggests hosting an archery tournament, with the Lady Marian presenting a golden arrow as the prize to entrap Robin. Robin enters the tournament, is recognized by his archery skill, and is captured and sentenced to be hanged. Marian aids Robins Men in a scheme to save him. After his daring escape, he scales the palace walls to thank her, and the two pledge their love for one another. Marian declines Robins marriage proposal, electing to instead remain in the castle as a spy. King Richard returns with several of his knights. The Bishop of the Black Canons sees through Richards disguise and alerts John. John sends disgraced former knight Dickon Malbete to kill Richard, promising Dickon Robins title and lands. Marian overhears and writes to Robin, but is found out by Gisbourne and sentenced to death. Her nursemaid, Bess, tells Much everything. He intercepts Dickon and kills him after a fight. Richard and his men, disguised as Norman monks, travel through Sherwood and are stopped by Robin. Assuring Robin they are on the kings business, Richard accepts Robins offer of hospitality and his condemnation of Holy Crusade, but does not reveal his identity. Much relays Besses news. Robin orders his men to find and protect Richard; now certain of Robins loyalty, Richard reveals himself. Robin coerces the Bishop of the Black Canons to allow them to join his monks in disguise so they can enter Nottingham Castle. Once inside, Richard announces his presence, and a huge melee erupts. Robin kills Gisbourne after a lengthy duel, frees Marian, and prompts Johns men to surrender. Returned to his throne, Richard banishes John and restores Robins rank, raising him to Baron of Locksley and Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham. The king also pardons Robins men, and commands Robin to take the hand of the Lady Marian in marriage. As Robin exits the castle with her, he responds May I obey all your commands with equal pleasure, sire.",

            "plot": "In 1838, in the fictional German town of Wisborg, Thomas Hutter is sent to Transylvania by his employer, estate agent Herr Knock, to visit a new client, Count Orlok, who is planning on buying a house across from Hutter\\'s own residence. While embarking on his journey, Hutter stops at an inn in which the locals are frightened by the mere mention of Orlok\\'s name.Hutter rides on a coach to Orlok\\'s castle in the Carpathian Mountains, where he is welcomed by Orlok himself. When he is eating dinner and accidentally cuts his thumb, Orlok tries to suck the blood out, but his repulsed guest pulls his hand away. Hutter wakes up the morning after to find fresh punctures on his neck, which he attributes to mosquitoes. That night, Orlok signs the documents to purchase the house and notices on the table a miniature portrait of Hutter\\'s wife, Ellen, an image that the young man carries with him in a small circular frame. Admiring the portrait, the count remarks that she has a lovely neck. Reading a book about vampires that he took from the inn, Hutter begins to suspect that Orlok is indeed a vampire. With no way to bar the door to his bedroom, Hutter desperately tries to hide as midnight approaches. Suddenly, the door begins to slowly open by itself; and, as Orlok enters, a terrified Hutter hides under the bedcovers and falls unconscious. Meanwhile, back in Wisborg, Ellen arises from her own bed and sleepwalks to the railing of her bedroom\\'s balcony. She starts walking on top of the railing, which gets the attention of her friend Harding in the adjacent room. When the doctor arrives, Ellen shouts Hutter\\'s name and envisions Orlok in his castle threatening her unconscious husband.The next day, Hutter explores the castle, only to retreat back into his room after he finds the coffin in which Orlok is resting dormant in the crypt. Hours later, Orlok piles up coffins on a coach and climbs into the last one before the coach departs; Hutter rushes home after learning of this. The coffins are taken aboard a schooner, where the sailors discover rats in the coffins. All of the crewmen later die, and Orlok takes control of the vessel. When the ship arrives in Wisborg, Orlok leaves unobserved, carries one of his coffins and moves into the house that he purchased.Many deaths in the town follow after Orlok\\'s arrival, which the local doctors blame on an unspecified plague caused by the rats from the ship. Ellen reads the book that Hutter found; it claims that a vampire can be defeated if a pure-hearted woman distracts the vampire with her beauty and offers him her blood of her own free will; she decides to sacrifice herself. Ellen opens her window to invite Orlok in and pretends to fall ill so that she can send Hutter to fetch Professor Bulwer, a physician. After he leaves, Orlok enters and drinks her blood, but the sun rises, which causes Orlok to vanish in a puff of smoke. Ellen lives just long enough to be embraced by her grief-stricken husband.Orlok\\'s castle is later shown destroyed.",

            "plot": "Preceding the Bangladeshi War of Independence, 1971, Hidayat Khan is an Indian intelligence agent posing as an informant for the Pakistani military. Presenting as an Indian traitor trading secrets to Pakistan, he cultivates a friendship with Brigadier Parvez Syed of the Pakistan Army and is alerted of an operation planned against India. Fearing he will not live long enough to uncover further details due to his lung cancer, he asks his 20yearold daughter Sehmat, a student at Delhi University, to become an undercover agent of the Research and Analysis Wing, Indias external intelligence agency in Pakistan, through an arranged marriage with Syeds younger son, Major Iqbal, a Pakistani military officer. Sehmat joins the RAW and is trained by senior RAW officer Khalid Mir and his assistant, Nikhil Bakshi. Despite her youth and inexperience, Sehmat is a quick study, surprising her superiors with her acumen for intelligence work. After her marriage, she moves to their home with Iqbal in Rawalpindi, the Pakistan Armys headquarters. Sehmat wins the trust of the entire family except Abdul, Syeds trusted servant. A kind man, Iqbal is patient with Sehmat, frequently apologizing to her for his fathers denigration of India. Feelings develop between them leading to consummation of their marriage, and they start getting intimate. Despite her feelings, Sehmat remains true to her mission and establishes communication channels with her handlers back in India, relaying information. Brigadier Syed is promoted to Major General, resulting in crucial documents and members of their defense forces passing through his house. Sehmat relays information on the planning of an offensive against India, which points to a planned attack by a Pakistani submarine on the Indian aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, then deployed in the Bay of Bengal. Abdul discovers Sehmats communication tools in the bathroom and realises she is an Indian spy. He rushes off to tell Syed, forcing Sehmat to run him down with an army jeep, causing a heavy emotional toll on her. Abdul gasps out Sehmats name in the hospital before he dies, and Iqbals older brother, Mehboob, starts an investigation. Before he can provide his information to the InterServices Intelligence ISI, Pakistans internal security agency, Sehmat reluctantly kills him by injecting him with poison. Realising her cover is about to be blown, Mir visits her in disguise and conveys to her an escape plan from Pakistan. Later, Iqbal finds Sehmats communication tools concealed in Abduls room alongside a piece of an anklet he had given her as a wedding gift, discovering her secret. Heartbroken, he confronts Sehmat, who tearfully holds him at gunpoint and tells him her duty is to her country. Before their confrontation can escalate, Mehboobs young son, whom Sehmat had been tutoring to sing a patriotic song for his schools annual Army Day celebration, rushes in, giving her a chance to get away. Realising her duty requires her to kill both the boy and her driver to prevent them from discovering her identity, she walks away and arrives at the meeting point concealed in a burqa. Iqbal confronts her there, having notified the ISI, but when Mir spots them, he orders his undercover RAW team to shoot Sehmat and throws a grenade, killing both Sehmat and Iqbal. Mir and his team escape to a safe house, where the real Sehmat shows up, revealing the woman who died in the blast with Iqbal was another secret agent she had switched places with before Iqbal caught up to her. Traumatized by her husbands death and Mirs orders to kill her, Sehmat returns with the RAW team to her hometown. She faints shortly after arriving and later discovers she is pregnant, deciding to keep Iqbals child. Newsreel footage reveals the Indian Navy was able to sink the Pakistani submarine PNS Ghazi before it could carry out its planned attack on the INS Vikrant with the assistance of Sehmats findings. Now Indian Army officer Lieutenant General Nikhil Bakshi addresses a group of officers and soldiers of tri services and also cadets of NDA, including officer Colonel Samar Syed, aboard the Indian aircraft carrier INS Viraat, off the coast of Visakhapatnam. Lieutenant General Nikhil Bakshi concludes his speech to the officers on the INS Viraat, and Colonel Samar Syed is revealed to be Iqbal and Sehmats son. Sehmat Khans sacrifices are remembered. The movie ends where a bungalow type house is shown in an unknown location where now an aged Sehmat is living under security but alone",

When Ruben begins to lose his hearing, he goes to a pharmacy seeking a diagnosis. The pharmacist refers him to a doctor, who finds that Ruben has lost most of his hearing and that the rest will deteriorate rapidly. Although cochlear implants may benefit him, insurance does not cover their high cost. The doctor suggests that Ruben eliminate all exposure to loud noises and undergo further testing, but Ruben continues to perform. Lou wants to stop performing for his safety, but Ruben wants to continue. She is also concerned about his sobriety, as he is a recovering drug addict. They call his sponsor, Hector, who finds a rural shelter for Deaf recovering addicts run by a man named Joe, a recovering alcoholic who lost his hearing in the Vietnam War. Ruben leaves with Lou because they will not let her live there with him, and he wants only the implants. Anxious for his well-being, Lou leaves and persuades Ruben to return to the shelter. Ruben meets the other members of the shelter, attends meetings, and settles into his new life. He is introduced to schoolteacher Diane and the children in her class and learns American Sign Language. Joe tasks Ruben with writing and sitting peacefully in an effort to make him comfortable with the silence. Ruben joins Dianes class and connects with the children and the rest of the community. He gives the children and Diane drumming lessons. Joe invites Ruben to stay as an employee of the community. Ruben illicitly uses Joes office computer to follow Lous activities and learns she is performing music in Paris. He has his friend Jenn sell his drums and other music equipment, then he sells his RV, using the money for cochlear implant surgery. Ruben asks Joe to loan him money to buy back his RV while he awaits the activation of the implants. Joe refuses, saying that Ruben is behaving like an addict. He asks Ruben to leave the community, as it is founded on the belief that Deafness is not a handicap. Ruben has his implants activated but is disappointed by their distorted sound. He flies to Paris to meet Lou at the home of her wealthy father, Richard. Richard confides in Ruben that though he initially disliked him, he recognizes that Ruben made Lou happy. Lou has settled into her new lifestyle and has ceased selfharming. At a party, Lou and Richard perform a duet, Rubens perception of the sound is distorted by the implants. When Ruben tells Lou he wants to return to their music, she responds with interest but begins scratching her arms. Ruben tells her all is well and that she saved his life. She tells him that he saved hers too. The next morning, Ruben takes his things and leaves while Lou sleeps. In a park, the ringing of a church bell is distorted by his implants, Ruben removes his processors and sits in silence.",

            "plot": "Katherine Goble works at the West Area of Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, in 1961, alongside her colleagues Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan, as lowly computers, performing mathematical calculations without being told what they are for. All of them are AfricanAmerican women; the unit is segregated by race and sex. White supervisor Vivian Mitchell assigns Katherine to assist Al Harrisons Space Task Group, given her skills in analytic geometry. She becomes the first Black woman on the team; head engineer Paul Stafford is especially dismissive. Mary is assigned to the space capsule heat shield team, where she immediately identifies a design flaw. Encouraged by her team leader Karl Zielinski, a PolishJewish Holocaust survivor, Mary applies for a NASA engineer position. She is told by Mitchell that, regardless of her mathematics and physical science degree, the position requires additional courses. Mary files a petition for permission to attend allwhite Hampton High School, despite her husbands opposition. Pleading her case in court, she wins over the local judge by appealing to his sense of history, allowing her to attend night classes. Katherine meets AfricanAmerican National Guard Lt. Col. Jim Johnson, who voices skepticism about womens mathematical abilities. He later apologizes and begins spending time with Katherine and her three daughters. The Mercury Seven astronauts visit Langley, and astronaut John Glenn goes out of his way to greet the West Area women. Katherine impresses Harrison by solving a complex mathematical equation from redacted documents, as the Soviet Unions successful launch of Yuri Gagarin increases pressure to send American astronauts into space. Harrison confronts Katherine about her breaks, unaware that she is forced to walk half a mile 800 meters to use the nearest restroom designated to colored people. She angrily explains the discrimination she faces at work, which leads Harrison to destroy the colored restroom signs and abolish restroom segregation. He allows Katherine to be included in highlevel meetings to calculate the space capsules reentry point. Stafford makes Katherine remove her name from reports, insisting that computers cannot author them, and her work is credited solely to Stafford. Informed by Mitchell that there are no plans to assign a permanent supervisor for the colored group, Dorothy learns NASA has installed an IBM 7090 electronic computer that threatens to replace human computers. When a librarian scolds her for visiting the whitesonly section, Dorothy sneaks out a book about Fortran and teaches herself and her West Area co-workers programming. She visits the computer room, successfully starts the machine, and is promoted to supervise the Programming Department; she agrees to do so if thirty of her co-workers are transferred as well. Mitchell finally addresses her as Mrs. Vaughan. Making final arrangements for John Glenns launch, the department no longer needs human computers; Katherine is reassigned to the West Area and marries Jim. On the day of the launch, discrepancies are found in the IBM 7090 calculations, and Katherine is asked to check the capsules landing coordinates. She delivers the results to the control room, and Harrison allows her inside. After a successful launch and orbit, a warning indicates the capsules heat shield may be loose. Mission Control decides to land Glenn after three orbits instead of seven, and Katherine supports Harrisons suggestion to leave the retrorocket attached to help keep the heat shield in place. Friendship 7 lands successfully. Though the mathematicians are ultimately replaced by electronic computers, a textual epilogue reveals Mary obtained her engineering degree and became NASAs first female African American engineer; Dorothy continued as NASAs first African American supervisor; and Katherine, accepted by Stafford as a report coauthor, went on to calculate the trajectories for the Apollo 11 and Space Shuttle missions. In 2015, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 2016, NASA dedicated the Langley Research Centers Katherine Johnson Computational Building in her honor.",

            "plot": "Paddington, having settled with the Brown family in Windsor Gardens, offers his neighbours emotional support in various ways. To purchase a oneofakind pop-up book of London in Samuel Grubers antique shop for his Aunt Lucys 100th birthday, Paddington performs several odd jobs and saves his wages. One night, he witnesses a burglary at the shop in which the book is stolen. Paddington chases the thief, who escapes, and Paddington is framed and arrested. The thief returns home and is revealed to be the Browns neighbour, Phoenix Buchanan, an egotistical actor. In court, Mr Gruber states that he does not believe that Paddington stole the book. However, with no evidence of the thieves existence, Paddington is convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison. In prison, Paddington is assigned to laundry duty, but accidentally washes a red sock with the white prison uniforms the uniforms turn pink, angering the prisoners. The prisons shorttempered chef, Knuckles McGinty, hires Paddington to work in the kitchen after being impressed by his marmalade sandwich recipe. Meanwhile, the Browns attempt to prove Paddingtons innocence, putting up sketches of the thief all over London, while Buchanan uses the book to locate a series of clues within Londons landmarks, which reveal the location of a secret treasure. The Browns encounter a fortune teller who informs them that the books clues lead to the hidden fortune of the books author. Because of Paddingtons influence, the prison becomes a much livelier and friendlier place, but Paddington struggles to remain positive because the Browns are unable to prove his innocence despite their continuous efforts. Knuckles and two other prisoners, Phibs and Spoon, later tell Paddington that although the Browns mean well, they will eventually forget about him. Becoming convinced that Buchanan is the culprit, Mary and Henry Brown search for the stolen book inside his house. They find a secret attic where Buchanans various costumes are stashed, including the disguise he wore to steal the book. However, the Browns investigation cause them to forget to attend the prisons monthly visiting day, causing Paddington to believe the Browns have forgotten about him. Paddington joins Knuckles, Phibs and Spoon in a prison escape. They promise to aid in proving Paddingtons innocence, but after escaping, they promptly abandon the idea in order to flee the country, inviting Paddington to join them. Paddington declines, feeling betrayed by Knuckles. While avoiding the police, Paddington uses a public telephone to contact the Browns, who tell him Buchanan is the real culprit. To catch Buchanan, they arrange to meet at Paddington station, where a carnival train carrying the hidden fortune is due to leave. Paddington reaches the station and boards the train immediately before it leaves. The Browns arrive shortly afterward and use a LNER Peppercorn Class A1 to pursue the carnival train. Buchanan finds the hidden fortune, but Paddington thwarts him. Henry, Judy and Mrs Bird board the carnival train to confront Buchanan, who overpowers them and escapes. Buchanan severs the coupling of the trains caboose after locking Paddington inside it. However, Judy photographs Buchanan holding the book, and Henry subsequently knocks him unconscious. Paddington is still trapped in the rear carriage when it derails and crashes into a nearby river. Mary tries to rescue Paddington, but struggles to open the locked carriage. Knuckles, Phibs and Spoon arrive and help Mary save Paddington. Paddington falls into a coma, but wakes up on Lucys birthday to find himself at home. He learns that he has been exonerated, Buchanan has been arrested, and the book has been taken by the police as evidence of Buchanans crimes. Although Paddington is disappointed that he cannot give Lucy the book, he discovers that the Browns and their neighbours arranged for Lucy to visit London herself. Opening the front door to her, Paddington hugs Lucy and wishes her a happy birthday. Knuckles, Phibs and Spoon are pardoned, and Knuckles opens a sandwich restaurant, which becomes incredibly successful. Buchanan is sentenced to ten years in prison. Six months later, he is shown to be putting his experience as a performer to further use by performing elaborate musical numbers with the other prisoners.",

            "plot": "Three Pakistani youth throw packets of drugs across the border to India for it to be picked up later. Tejinder Tommy Singh, better known as Gabru among his fans, is a young and successful Punjabi musician who lives a luxurious lifestyle. Together with an ostentatious crew led by his uncle Tayaji and cousin Jassi, he routinely indulges in cocaine consumption. Tommy is popular for his energetic songs with lyrics that often glorify violence and drug addiction. However, his addiction costs him his music contract and lands him in jail. While in prison, he meets two of his diehard fans who remark how Tommy\\'s lifestyle had inspired theirs, leading them to murder their own mother for drug money. Realizing that his songs have negatively affected teenagers, Tommy decides to change his ways upon release. A few days later, he engages in an altercation and inadvertently shoots Tayaji, injuring his ear. This causes Tayaji to send Tommy and his crew away to a farmhouse so that he can prepare for an upcoming concert. Working on the farm is a migrant worker from Bihar nicknamed Bauria, whose dreams of playing nationallevel hockey for the country were shattered due to her father\\'s death, pushing her to Punjab to work as a laborer. She works for a local landlord who uses agriculture as a front for drugpeddling. One night, she finds a suspicious packet on the farm and realizes that it is some kind of a drug. She resolves to sell it but her search for a potential buyer lands her in trouble as she unwittingly contacts the original owners of the heroin. She is captured by the gang of drug peddlers but not before she discards it into a well. As a compensation for their lost drugs, the peddlers forcibly keep her at their house, where she is sexually and physically abused, given drugs, and pimped to men. Some weeks later, she manages to escape. Over in the neighboring town lives Preet Sahni, a doctor and activist who runs a rehabilitation center. Sartaj Singh is a junior policeman who knows about the drug smuggling his seniors are allowing on a large scale. But when it affects his family, as his brother, Balli, overdoses and is brought to Preet\\'s clinic, he realizes the grave situation. Preet and Sartaj decide to find the root cause of the problem together. Balli is admitted into her drug rehabilitation centre against his will. At his concert, instead of singing, Tommy starts preaching. Infuriated by his speech about how one should lead one\\'s life, his fans start throwing bottles at him. The angered Tommy urinates in front of the crowd before fleeing. He hides in an old structure and meets Bauria, also hiding. The two share their stories and bond. However, Bauria is recaptured by the same gang when she defends Tommy from being attacked by them. He learns the next day that an arrest warrant has been issued for him because of the public ruckus at the concert, and sets out to find Bauria after realising his feelings for her. Preet and Sartaj find that the driving force behind the drug problem in Punjab is an elderly man called Virender Singh, who has flourished with the support of his fatherinlaw, MP Maninder Brar. The two go to extreme measures to collect evidence against the politician and put together a report to be sent to the state\\'s Election Commission to thwart Brar\\'s campaign for another term in power. Sartaj and Preet fall in love; however, one night, Preet sees a manic Balli trying to escape from her rehab center. On trying to stop him, she is accidentally stabbed in the neck by him. As Balli is Sartaj\\'s brother, senior officer Jhujar Singh who investigates the homicide decides to send him underground. While falsifying the crime scene he comes across the report made by her and Sartaj, and is infuriated when he sees that he too has been named in the drug racket. He calls Sartaj and knocks him out when he arrives. Waking up in the presence of the local drug mafia at their farmhouse, where Bauria is also confined, a bruised and beaten Sartaj is questioned by Jhujar, who is a key member in the drug racket. Sartaj says whatever he did was for the sake of Punjab. At the same time, Tommy enters the house, armed with a hockey stick. Taking advantage of the distraction, Sartaj grabs Jhujar\\'s gun and shoots the whole gang before freeing Balli. Tommy helps Bauria escape from her captors. Balli kneels and cries in front of his brother, whose face is expressionless. Eventually, it is shown that the government issued an inquiry into Brar\\'s activities and there has been a huge crackdown on the drug menace. Over in Goa, amidst his crew members, Tommy calls Bauria to ask for her real name. Sitting by the beach, she catches sight of a foreigner having fun. Inspired, she says Mary Jane, to which Tommy flirtatiously replies that she is his life, and she ends the call before going for a swim.",

            "plot": "Research scientist Galen Erso and his family hide on the planet Lahmu when Imperial weapons developer Orson Krennic arrives to press him into completing the Death Star, a superweapon capable of destroying planets. Galen's wife Lyra is killed in the confrontation while their daughter Jyn escapes and is rescued by rebel extremist Saw Gerrera. Fifteen years later, cargo pilot Bodhi Rook defects from the Empire, taking a holographic message from Galen to Saw on the moon Jedha. Rebel Alliance intelligence officer Cassian Andor learns of the Death Star and Bodhi's defection from an informant. Jyn is freed from an Imperial labor camp on Wobani and is brought to the Rebels' base on Yavin IV, where Rebel leader Mon Mothma convinces her to find Galen so the Alliance can learn more about the superweapon. Cassian is covertly ordered to aid Jyn but to kill Galen rather than extract him. Jyn, Cassian, and reprogrammed former Imperial droid K-2SO travel to Jedha, where the Empire loots kyber crystals to power the Death Star. In Jedha City, Saw and his partisans are engaged in an armed insurgency against the Empire and Jyn and Cassian get caught in the crossfire. Aided by blind spiritual warrior Chirrut Imwe and his mercenary friend Baze Malbus, Jyn makes contact with Saw, who is holding Bodhi. Saw shows her the message in which Galen reveals he has secretly built a vulnerability into the Death Star. The schematics are located in an Imperial data vault on the planet Scarif. Onboard the Death Star, Krennic orders a test fire, which destroys Jedha City. Jyn and her group take Bodhi and flee the moon, but Saw remains there to die. Imperial governor Grand Moff Tarkin congratulates Krennic before using Bodhi's defection as a pretext to take control of the Death Star. Bodhi leads the group to Galen's Imperial research facility on the planet Eadu, where Cassian hesitates to kill Galen. Rebel bombers then attack the facility. Galen is wounded and dies in Jyn's arms before she escapes with her group on a stolen Imperial cargo shuttle. Krennic is summoned by Darth Vader to answer for the attack on Jedha City. Krennic seeks his support for an audience with the Emperor, but Vader instead force-chokes him and orders him to ensure no further problems occur. Jyn proposes a mission to steal the Death Star schematics, but the Alliance Council feels there is no chance of victory. Frustrated at their inaction, Jyn's group leads a small squad of volunteers, which Bodhi dubs Rogue One, to raid the vault. Using the stolen Imperial shuttle, they gain access through the planet's shield. Jyn, Cassian, and K-2SO infiltrate the base while the others attack the Imperial garrison as a diversion. The Alliance learns of the raid from intercepted Imperial communications and deploys their fleet in support, leading to a space battle against the Imperial fleet. K-2SO sacrifices himself so Jyn and Cassian can retrieve the data. Chirrut is killed after activating the switch to allow communication with the Rebel fleet, and Baze is killed shortly afterward. Bodhi is killed by a grenade after informing the Rebel fleet that it must deactivate the planetary shield to allow the transmission of the plans. Rebel Admiral Raddus uses a Rebel ship to crash two Imperial Star Destroyers into each other; the wreckage destroys the shield generator. Jyn obtains the schematics but is ambushed by Krennic, who is shot and wounded by Cassian. Jyn transmits the schematics to the Rebel command ship moments before the Death Star arrives above Scarif, commanded by Tarkin. He orders the Death Star to destroy the citadel, killing everyone, including Krennic, Cassian, and Jyn. The Rebel fleet prepares to jump to hyperspace, but many ships are intercepted by Darth Vader's Star Destroyer. Vader boards the Rebel command ship and kills many troops trying to regain the schematics, but a smaller ship escapes with the plans. Aboard the fleeing ship as it enters hyperspace, Princess Leia Organa declares that the schematics will provide hope for the Rebellion.",

Armand reluctantly agrees and heads for Paris.P\u00e8re Tanguy, a Montmartre art supplier, tells Armand that Theo actually died six months after Vincent. He suggests that Armand travel to Auvers-sur-Oise and look for Paul GachetDr. Paul Gachet, who housed Van Gogh after his release from an asylum, shared his love for art, and attended the funeral. Once there, Armand learns that the doctor is out on business. So he stays at Auberge Ravouxthe same inn that Van Gogh did during his time in the area. There he meets the temporary proprietress Portraits by Vincent van GoghAdeline RavouxAdeline Ravoux, who was fond of Van Gogh and also surprised by his death. At her suggestion, Armand visits the local boatman, who informs him that Van Gogh kept close company with Dr. Gachets sheltered daughter, Marguerite. When Armand visits her, Marguerite denies and is angered when Armand implies that Van Goghs suicidal mood could have resulted from an argument with her father.Throughout the investigation, Armand begins to suspect a local boy named Ren\u00e9 Secretan, who reportedly liked to torment Van Gogh, owned a gun, and had often drunkenly brandished it around town. Dr. Mazery, who examined Van Gogh, also claims that the shot must have come from a few feet away, ruling out suicide. When Armand implicates Ren\u00e9, Marguerite confesses that she was in close, but not romantic, relations with Van Gogh, but she does not believe that Ren\u00e9 was capable of murder.Dr. Gachet finally returns and promises to deliver Armands letter to Theos widow. He admits there was an argument between them \u2013 Van Gogh accused Gachet of being a coward for not pursuing his dreams, to which Gachet angrily accused Van Gogh of worsening Theos health by overly depending on his brother. Gachet posits that this accusation drove Van Gogh to suicide in order to release Theo from the burden. After Armand returns home, postman Roulin later receives word from Theos widow, Johanna van Gogh-BongerJohanna, thanking Armand for returning the letter. Johanna attaches to her letter to Armand one of Van Goghs letters to her \u2013 signed, Your loving Vincent.",

Through a rare mix-up of the dabbawalas (complicated food delivery system in Mumbai that picks up and delivers lunches from restaurants or homes to people at work), the tiffin carrier lunchbox Ila prepares for her husband gets accidentally delivered, instead, to Saajan Fernandes, a middle-aged widower who is about to retire from his job of an accountant. Ila eventually realises the mistake and with the advice of her neighbour aunt, Mrs. Deshpande, living in the apartment above her, writes a letter to Saajan about the mix-up and places it in the lunchbox along with her husbands favourite meal the next day. An exchange of the messages sent back and forth in the letters with the lunches ignites a friendship between the two, as they share memories and events of their own individual lives. At work, Saajan is tasked with training his replacement, Aslam Shaikh. Socially distant after his wifes death, Saajan is initially reluctant to interact with Shaikh and train him. After Shaikh reveals that he is an orphan who taught himself accounting, Saajan gradually warms up to him, and eventually the duo strike a close friendship. At one point, Saajan saves Shaikhs job by covering for his blatant mistakes and becomes the best man at his marriage with Mehrunissa. Meanwhile, Ila discovers that Rajeev is having an extramarital affair and gives up hope of rekindling her marriage. In one of the lunchbox letters, she suggests moving to Bhutan where the cost of living is much cheaper than in India. Saajan writes back with the suggestion that the two move there together. Ila then offers to meet in person at a popular restaurant but at the appointed time, Saajan does not show up. Upon receiving an empty lunchbox in disappointment the next day, Saajan writes back to the dejected Ila and apologises to her, stating that he did arrive and watched her from a distance, but could not approach her. He explains how young and beautiful she looked, while surmising that he is too old for her and advising her to move on. Some time later, Ilas father, battling with lung cancer, dies in the care of her mother, who confesses how unhappy her marriage was. She gives Ila the advice Sometimes, the wrong train takes us to the right station. Ila receives the address of Saajans office from the dabbawalas only to learn from Shaikh that he has already retired and headed to Nashik. She writes a farewell message to Saajan announcing that she has decided to leave Rajeev and move to Bhutan with her young daughter, Yashvi. Meanwhile, Saajan changes his mind en route to Nashik and returns to Mumbai. The film ends with Ila waiting for Yashvi to return from school and Saajan heading to her house with the dabbawalas who regularly picked up and delivered the eponymous lunchbox.",

            "plot": "Shashi Godbole is a traditional Marathi homemaker and entrepreneur in Pune who makes and sells laddoos as a home-run business. Her husband Satish and daughter Sapna take her for granted, mock her because of her poor English-speaking skills, and generally treat her with disrespect, making Shashi feel negative, insecure, and underconfident. However, her young son, Sagar, loves her as she is, and her elderly widowed mother-in-law offers her words of sympathy. Shashi\\'s older sister, Manu, who lives in New York City, invites Shashi\\'s family to the marriage of her daughter, Meera, with Kevin. It is decided that Shashi will travel to New York alone five weeks in advance to help Manu organise the marriage, while her husband and children will join her as the marriage approaches. During her flight to America, Shashi is given inspirational advice by a fellow passenger. Upon her arrival in New York, Shashi is warmly welcomed by Manu and her younger daughter, Radha. While Shashi is in New York, she has a traumatic experience at a coffee shop where a staff member is rude to her due to her inability to communicate in English. She is comforted by fellow customer, French chef Laurent, who himself is weak in English. Using the money she earned by selling laddoos, Shashi secretly enrolls in a conversational four-week English class, showing her resourcefulness at navigating an unfamiliar city alone. The class comprises the instructor David Fischer, a Mexican nanny Eva, a Pakistani taxi driver Salman Khan, a Chinese hairstylist Yu Song, a Tamil software engineer Ramamurthy, a shy African-Caribbean man Udumbke, and Laurent. Shashi quickly becomes a promising and committed student, earns everyone\\'s respect with her charming behavior and her cuisine, and gains self-confidence. Laurent becomes attracted to Shashi, leading to some interpersonal conflict. When he tries to kiss her at the rooftop of a building, Shashi pushes him away and runs off, but fails to explain that she is married. Meanwhile, Radha finds out about Shashi\\'s secret English classes and is supportive of her pursuit. Shashi begins watching English films at night and does her homework diligently. To complete the English-speaking course and receive an academic certificate, each student must write and deliver a five-minute speech. Shashi\\'s family shows up earlier than planned as a surprise, and after missing out on an event where Sagar injures his leg, Shashi eventually decides to quit because of scheduling conflicts and the fact that she considers herself to be an irresponsible mother since she did not realise that Sagar was injured. The test date coincides with that of the marriage, forcing Shashi to miss the test. Radha invites David and the entire class to the marriage, where Satish is taken aback at being introduced to a diverse group of people by his wife. Shashi gives a touching and enlightening toast to the married couple in English, surprising everyone. In her speech, Shashi extols the virtues of being married and having a family, describing the family as a safe space of love and respect where weaknesses are not mocked. Satish and Sapna regret treating her with disrespect. David declares she has passed the course with distinction and issues her the certificate. Shashi thanks Laurent for \"making her feel better about herself.\" Shashi\\'s family returns to India by flight.",

            "plot": "On the New England island of New Penzance, 12-year-old orphan Sam Shakusky attends Camp Ivanhoe, a Khaki Scout summer camp led by Scout Master Randy Ward. Suzy Bishop, also 12, lives on the island with her parents Walt and Laura, both lawyers, and her three younger brothers in a house called Summer's End. Sam and Suzy, both introverted, intelligent, and mature for their age, meet in the summer of 1964 during a church performance of Noye's Fludde and become pen pals. The relationship becomes romantic over the course of their correspondence, and they make a secret pact to reunite and run away together. In September 1965, they execute their plan. Sam escapes from Camp Ivanhoe while Suzy runs away from Summer's End. The pair rendezvous, hike, camp, and fish in the wilderness with the goal of reaching a specific location. Meanwhile, the Khaki Scouts have become aware of Sam's absence, finding a letter he left behind stating he has resigned. Scout Master Ward tells the Khaki Scouts to use their skills to set up a search party and find Sam. Island Police Captain Duffy Sharp and Ward contact Sam's guardians the Billingsleys, learning they are actually his foster parents and Sam is an orphan with a history of behavioral issues at home. Eventually, a group of Khaki Scouts confronts Sam and Suzy and tries to capture them. During the resulting altercation, Suzy injures the Scouts' de facto leader Redford with a pair of scissors, and a stray arrow fired by one of the Scouts kills Camp Ivanhoe's dog Snoopy. The Scouts flee, and Sam and Suzy hike to Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet which they name Moonrise Kingdom. They set up camp and as the romantic tension between them grows, they dance on the beach and share each other's first kiss. Suzy's parents, Ward, the Scouts, and Sharp finally find Sam and Suzy in their tent the next morning. Suzy's parents take her home. Ward gives Sam a letter from the Billingsleys stating that they no longer wish to house Sam. He stays with Sharp while they await the arrival of a Social Services worker, who will likely place Sam in an orphanage and possibly treat him with electroshock therapy. While in their treehouse, the Camp Ivanhoe Scouts have a change of heart and decide to help Suzy and Sam. They help Suzy and Sam sneak out and then together paddle to neighboring St. Jack Wood Island to seek out the help of Ben, an older cousin of the scout Skotak. Ben works at Fort Lebanon, a larger Khaki Scout summer camp on St. Jack Wood Island run by Ward's superior, Commander Pierce. Ben decides to try to take Sam and Suzy to a crabbing boat anchored off the island so that Sam can work as a crewman and avoid Social Services. He performs a wedding ceremony, which he claims is not legally binding, before they leave. Sam, Suzy, and Ben set off for the crabbing boat in a sailboat, but quickly return so that Sam can retrieve Suzy's binoculars. As Sam returns to the camp chapel to look for the binoculars, he is confronted by Redford, who alerts the camp to Sam and Suzy's presence. Suzy's parents, Captain Sharp, Social Services, and the Scouts of Fort Lebanon, under the command of Ward, pursue them. A violent hurricane and flash flood strike, and Sharp apprehends Sam and Suzy on the steeple of the church in which they first met. Lightning destroys the steeple, but Sharp saves them. During the storm, he decides to become Sam's legal guardian. The hurricane erases Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet from the map. At Summer's End, Sam is upstairs painting a landscape of Moonrise Kingdom. Suzy and her brothers are called to dinner, while Sam slips out of the window to join Sharp in his patrol car, telling Suzy he will see her the following day.",

            "plot": "Thorin Oakenshield and his company are being pursued by Azog and his Orc party. They are ushered by Gandalf to the nearby home of Beorn, a skinchanger who can take the form of a bear. That night, Azog is summoned to Dol Guldur by the Necromancer, who commands him to marshal his forces for war. Azog delegates the hunt for Thorin to his son Bolg. After telling the company about the dangers of Mirkwood, including the Necromancers rise and the Wood-elves being dangerous, Beorn escorts the company to the borders of Mirkwood, where Gandalf discovers Black Speech imprinted on an old ruin. This, and a prior request by Galadriel, prompts him to investigate the tombs of the Nazg\u00fbl. Before leaving the company, he warns them to remain on the path. They lose their way in the forest and are ensnared by giant spiders. Bilbo frees the dwarves with the help of the invisibility ring and begins to understand its dark influence when he drops the ring and brutally kills a spider to retrieve it. The remaining spiders are killed by the Wood-elves led by Tauriel and Legolas, who capture the Dwarves and bring Thorin before their king, Thranduil. Thorin confronts the king about his neglect of the Dwarves of Erebor following Smaugs attack 60 years earlier and is consequently imprisoned with the other Dwarves. Bilbo, having avoided capture, helps them escape in empty wine barrels that are sent downstream. They are pursued by Wood-elves and ambushed by Bolg and his Orc party, resulting in a three-way battle as they rush down the river in the barrels. The Dwarves escape both groups of pursuers, but K\u00edli is wounded with a Morgul shaft. Thranduil seals off his kingdom when an Orc captive reveals that an evil army is amassing in the south, but Tauriel decides to leave and assist the Dwarves and Legolas goes after her. Gandalf and Radagast investigate the tombs of the Nazg\u00fbl and find them empty. Gandalf finds out that the Nine have been called to Dol Guldur and deduces that Sauron has returned and is preparing for war. The company is smuggled into Esgaroth by a bargeman called Bard. Thorin promises the Master of Laketown a share of the mountains treasure, and they are given arms and sent off to the mountain. Due to his injury, K\u00edli is forced to remain behind at Bards home, tended to by F\u00edli, \u00d3in, and Bofur. Bilbo discovers the hidden entrance in the Lonely Mountain and is sent inside to retrieve the Arkenstone. However, he accidentally awakens Smaug, who reveals his knowledge of both the dwarves plot and the return of Sauron. In Laketown, it is revealed that Bard is a descendant of the last ruler of Dale and possesses the last black arrow capable of killing Smaug. Bard attempts to bring the black arrow to the towns launcher, fearing what may happen in the mountain. However, he is arrested by the Master, charging his son to hide the arrow. Bolg and his Orc party infiltrate the town and attack the four Dwarves, but Tauriel and Legolas arrive and quickly dispatch them. Meanwhile, Gandalf infiltrates Dol Guldur alone after sending Radagast to warn Galadriel of their discovery at the tombs. He finds and cures Thr\u00e1in before they are ambushed by Azog. The Necromancer overpowers and defeats Gandalf and reveals himself as Sauron. Gandalf watches helplessly as Azog and an Orc army march from Dol Guldur towards the Lonely Mountain. Inside the mountain, during a long chase, Bilbo and the Dwarves rekindle the mountains forge using Smaugs flames and melt a large golden statue, hoping to bury Smaug alive in the molten gold. They do so, but Smaug emerges from the gold, stumbles out of the mountain and flies off to destroy Laketown as Bilbo watches in despair.",

            "plot": "In August 1968, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, David Dellinger, Lee Weiner, John Froines, and Bobby Seale make preparations to protest at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Five months later, they are arrested and charged with crossing state lines to incite a riot. John N. Mitchell, the Attorney General, appoints Tom Foran and Richard Schultz as the prosecutors, while all the defendants except Seale are represented by William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass. Judge Julius Hoffman shows significant prejudice for the prosecution, especially insisting that he and Abbie Hoffman are not related. Seales attorney, Charles Garry, cannot attend due to illness, leading Judge Hoffman to insist that Kunstler represent him. This insistence is rejected by both Kunstler and Seale. Seale receives support from Fred Hampton which Judge Hoffman assumes is legal help. Abbie Hoffman openly antagonizes the court. Judge Hoffman removes two jurors who he suspects sympathize with the defendants due to alleged threats from the Black Panther Party and charges the defendants and their attorneys with multiple counts of contempt of court. Tension builds between the defendants. Numerous undercover police officers and FBI agents testify. At the time of the convention, Hayden noticed two police officers tailing Davis and attempted to let the air out of their tire, but was caught and later arrested. Abbie and others led a protest to the police station where Hayden was detained but turned around upon seeing the police blockade outside. When trying to return to the park, police had taken control of the hill with orders to disperse the crowd leading to a riot between police and protesters. Days later, the defendants learn that Fred Hampton was killed during a police raid. In retaliation for Seale continuing to speak up for his constitutional rights, Judge Hoffman has him taken to another room, beaten, and returned gagged and chained. This causes the defense and the prosecution to object, and Judge Hoffman declares Seales case a mistrial. The defense puts Ramsey Clark, Attorney General during the riots, on the stand. Judge Hoffman refuses to let him testify in front of the jury as he had declined to initiate prosecutions after the riots because of evidence that the Chicago Police Department instigated them. Dellinger punches a bailiff, resulting in his arrest. Kunstler presents a tape implicating Hayden to the defendants and preps Hayden for cross-examination. On the night of the riot, Davis tried to pacify officers trying to arrest someone climbing a flagpole. After the police clubbed Daviss head, an enraged Hayden exclaimed, If blood is going to flow, then let it flow all over the city. The defendants were cornered by police and beaten. Abbie deduces that Hayden had misspoken, claiming the statement would have started with, If our blood is going to flow. Realizing that mistake would be exploitable on the stand, Hayden asks Abbie to testify. Abbie agrees. At the end of the trial, Hayden is given a chance by Judge Hoffman, who feels Hayden is genuinely remorseful, to make a case for a lenient sentence. However, over Judge Hoffmans objections, Hayden uses his closing remarks to name the 4,752 soldiers who were killed in the Vietnam War since the trial began. This act prompts many in the court to stand and cheer, with even Schultz choosing to stand out of respect.",

            "plot": "Micky Ward is an American welterweight boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts. Managed by his mother, Alice Ward, and trained by his older half-brother, Dicky Eklund, Micky became a stepping stone for other boxers to defeat on their way up. Dicky, a former boxer whose peak of success was going the distance with Sugar Ray Leonard in 1978, has become addicted to crack cocaine. He is being filmed for an HBO documentary he believes to be about his comeback. On the night of an undercard fight in Atlantic City, Mickys scheduled opponent Saoul Mamby is ill, and a substitute is found in Mike Mungin who is 20 pounds heavier than Micky, a huge difference in professional boxing, constituting two or three weight classes. Despite Mickys reservations, his mother and brother agree so that they can all get the purse and tell Micky that the fighter is out of shape and has ring rust. They arrive at the fight and find that the substitute fighter is actually ready for the fight and in top shape, and soundly defeats Micky. Micky retreats from the world and forms a relationship with Charlene Fleming, a former college athlete who dropped out and became a bartender. After several weeks, Alice arranges another fight for Micky, but Micky is concerned it will turn out the same. His mother and seven sisters blame Charlene for his lack of motivation. Micky mentions he received an offer to be paid to train in Las Vegas, but Dicky says he will match the offer so he can keep training and working with his family. Dicky then tries to get money by posing his girlfriend as a prostitute and then, once she picks up a client, impersonating a police officer to steal the clients money. This is foiled by the actual police and Dicky is arrested after a chase and a fight with them. Micky tries to stop the police from beating his brother and a police officer brutally breaks his hand before arresting him. At their arraignment, Micky is released, but Dicky is sent to jail. Micky washes his hands of Dicky. On the night of the HBO documentarys airing, Dickys family, and Dicky himself in prison, are horrified to see that it is called Crack in America and depicts how crack addiction ruined Dickys career and life. Dicky begins training and trying to get his life together in prison. Micky is lured back into boxing by his father, who believes Alice and his stepson Dicky are bad influences and did more damage to his career than good. The other members of his training team and a new manager, Sal Lanano, persuade Micky to return to boxing with the explicit understanding that his mother and brother will no longer be involved. They place Micky in minor fights to help him regain his confidence. He is then offered another major fight against an undefeated up-and-coming boxer. During a prison visit, Dicky advises Micky on how best to work his opponent, but Micky feels his brother is being selfish and trying to restart his own failed career. During the actual match, Micky is nearly overwhelmed, but then implements his brothers advice and triumphs; he earns the title shot for which his opponent was being groomed. Upon his release from prison, Dicky and his mother go to see Micky train. Assuming things are as they were, Dicky prepares to spar with his brother, but Micky informs him that he is no longer allowed per Mickys agreement with his current team. In the ensuing argument, in which Micky chastises both factions of his family, Charlene and his trainer leave in disgust. Micky and Dicky spar until Micky knocks Dicky down. Dicky storms off, presumably to get high again, and Alice chides Micky, only to be sobered when he tells her that she has always favored Dicky. Dicky returns to his crack house, where he says goodbye to his friends and heads to Charlenes apartment. He tells her that Micky needs both of them and they need to work together. After bringing everyone back together, the group goes to London for the title fight against welterweight champion Shea Neary. Micky scores another upset victory and the welterweight title. The film jumps a few years ahead, with Dicky crediting his brother as the creator of his own success. The real-life brothers banter as the end credits run.",

            "plot": "While hunting in the Mesoamerican rainforest, Jaguar Paw, his father Flint Sky, and their fellow tribesmen encounter a group of refugees fleeing from war and devastation. Returning to their village, Flint Sky notes that the refugees are sick with fear and urges Jaguar Paw to never allow fear to infect him. Later that night, the tribe gathers around an elder who tells a prophetic story about a being who is consumed by an emptiness that cannot be satisfied, despite having all the gifts of the world offered to him. The being will continue blindly taking until there is nothing left in the world for him to take, and the world is no more.The next morning, the village is attacked by Maya raiders led by Zero Wolf, and many are killed, including Flint Sky, who is killed by the sadistic raider Middle Eye. During the attack, Jaguar Paw hides both his pregnant wife Seven and their young son Turtles Run in an empty well before he is captured. In the aftermath, the raiders round up the surviving adults who are forced on a long march through the jungle, while the children are left to fend for themselves. Meanwhile, Seven and Turtles Run remain trapped in the well and they struggle to escape it.Along the way, the raiders and their captives encounter razed forests and vast fields of failed maize crops, alongside villages decimated by an unknown disease. They then encounter an infected little girl who prophesies the end of the Maya world. Arriving in the city, the captives are divided; the women are sold into slavery while the men are escorted to the top of a pyramid where they are brutally sacrificed to appease the gods. As Jaguar Paw is laid out on the altar, a solar eclipse occurs and the Maya take the event as an omen that the gods are satisfied, thereby sparing the remaining captives. However, the remaining captives are taken by the raiders to their barracks to be used as target practice; the raiders offer them freedom if they can dodge the missiles thrown at them, while Zero Wolf\\'s son Cut Rock finishes off the wounded. The first pair of runners, including Jaguar Paw\\'s friend Blunted, are easily struck down. Jaguar Paw follows thereafter, and is also wounded, drawing the attention of Cut Rock. However, Cut Rock is then distracted by the mortally wounded Blunted, whose sacrifice allows Jaguar Paw to kill Cut Rock and escape.An enraged Zero Wolf leads eight of his men to hunt down Jaguar Paw. Reaching the jungle, Jaguar Paw remembers his father\\'s words not to give in to fear, and challenges Zero Wolf to hunt him. Jaguar Paw uses his knowledge of the forest to survive while his pursuers are killed off one by one one is killed by a jaguar; a second is killed by a snake; a third is killed by Zero Wolf; a fourth drowns in a waterfall; a fifth is poisoned by Jaguar Paw. Among those he kills himself are Middle Eye, whom he bludgeons with a stone hatchet, and Zero Wolf, whom he lures into a spike trap made for tapir hunts. The last two raiders continue to pursue Jaguar Paw on the outskirts of his village. Reaching the shores amidst a heavy downpour, all three are stunned to witness the arrival of Spanish conquistadors. While the two raiders approach the foreigners, Jaguar Paw races back to his village and rescues his family before they are drowned by the downpour. Jaguar Paw is also overjoyed to see his infant son who was born underwater.Later, the reunited family gazes at the Spanish ships. Jaguar Paw chooses not to approach the foreigners, and he and his family depart to start a new life in the forest away from both the Maya and the Spanish.",

            "plot": "Sheryl Hoover is a mother of two living in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Her husband Richard is an aspiring motivational speaker and life coach. Dwayne, Sher  ys Nietzsche-reading teenage son from a previous marriage, has taken a vow of silence until he accomplishes his dream of becoming a fighter pilot. Sher  ls brother Frank, a gay scholar of Proust, is living with the family after having attempted suicide. Richards foul-mouthed father Edwin is also living with the family after being evicted from a retirement home for snorting heroin. Olive, Richard and Sher  ls young daughter, is an aspiring beauty queen coached by Edwin. Olive learns she has qualified for the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant being held in Redondo Beach, California, in two days. Richard, Sheryl, and Edwin want to support her, and Frank and Dwayne cannot be left alone, so the whole family attends. Due to financial constraints, they go on an 800 mi road trip in their yellow Volkswagen van. Family tensions play out along the way, amidst the aging vans mechanical problems. When the van breaks down early on, the family learns that they must push it until it is moving at about 20 mph before it is put into gear, at which point they have to run up to the side door and jump in. Later on, the vans horn starts honking unceasingly by itself, which leads to the family being pulled over by a state trooper. Throughout the trip, the family suffers numerous personal setbacks and discovers their need for each others support. Richard loses an important contract that would have jump-started his motivational business. Frank encounters the ex-boyfriend who, in leaving him for an academic rival, had prompted his suicide attempt. Edwin fatally overdoses on heroin. When the grief counselor refuses to let the family leave his corpse at the hospital while they go to the pageant and return later, they smuggle it into the van, almost getting caught by the police. During the final leg of the trip, Dwayne discovers he is colorblind, meaning he cannot become a pilot. This revelation prompts him to finally break his silence and shout his disdain for his family, though he apologizes after Olive calms him with a hug. After a frantic race against the clock, the family arrives at the pageant hotel. Sheryl prepares Olive for her performance while Richard is looking into arrangements for Edwins body. As the pageant begins, Richard and Dwayne realize that the other contestants are slim, sexualized pre-teen girls who perform elaborate dance numbers with great panache. Knowing that the amateur Olive is certain to be humiliated, they try to talk her out of performing. Sheryl insists that they let Olive be Olive, and Olive goes on stage. The hitherto-unseen dance routine Edwin had taught Olive is revealed to be a striptease performed to the Rocasound remix of Rick Jamess Super Freak. Olives performance horrifies and angers most of the audience and organizers, who demand she be removed from the stage. The members of the Hoover family join Olive on stage and dance alongside her to show their support. The family is later released from the hotels security office on the condition that Olive never enters a beauty pageant in California again. Piling into the van with the horn still honking, they happily smash through the barrier of the hotels toll booth and begin their trip back home to Albuquerque.",

            "plot": "Nicholas Angel, a recently promoted Metropolitan Police Sergeant, is reassigned to the rural town of Sandford, Gloucestershire, for being too exceptional. Angel arrests Danny Butterman for drunk driving, but later discovers that he is the son of Inspector Frank Butterman, and a police officer himself. Angel is frustrated by the villages mundanity, his and Franks incompetent colleagues, and the Neighbourhood Watch Alliances prioritisation of low crime statistics over law enforcement. Angel and Danny stop the two lead actors of a local production of Romeo and Juliet for speeding. A cloaked figure later murders the actors, and their deaths are staged as a car crash; only Angel suspects foul play.Angel and Danny discover an illegal weapons stash, including an old sea mine, and confiscate it. Angel warms to Danny, and together they binge-watch action films at Dannys house. That night, a cloaked figure attacks George Merchant, a wealthy land developer, in his home, and kills him in a gas explosion. Angel suspects that the deaths are connected to a recent property deal.Tim Messenger, a local journalist, approaches Angel at a village f\u00eate, claiming to have information. However, a cloaked figure kills Messenger by dislodging masonry from the churchs tower. Angel learns from Leslie Tiller, the village florist, about her plans to sell her land to Merchants business partners. While Angel is retrieving his notebook, a cloaked figure murders Tiller with her garden shears. Angel pursues the killer but to no avail. Angel suspects Simon Skinner, a supermarket manager, as the property deal would have built a rival supermarket, but Skinner has an alibi.After surmising that there are multiple killers, Angel is attacked in his hotel room by Michael Lurch Armstrong, an employee of Skinner. He incapacitates him and learns about a secret NWA meeting at Sandford Castle. The NWA, led by Frank, reveals that they committed the murders and staged them as accidents because each victim threatened Sandfords chances of winning Village of the Year. Irene, Franks late wife and Dannys mother, put everything into helping Sandford win the first-ever competition, but travellers moved in and ruined their chances the night before the adjudicators arrived, driving her to suicide. Frank has since vowed to help Sandford win Village of the Year every year, whatever the cost. Angel flees, but stumbles into the castles catacombs, discovering the corpses of the NWAs victims, some of whom Angel had helped arrest or question. Danny suddenly appears and feigns murdering Angel and, pretending to dispose of him, unsuccessfully urges him to return to London for his own safety. After arming himself with the confiscated guns, Angel and Danny engage in a shootout with the NWA. When Frank orders the other officers to arrest them, the pair successfully convinces them of Franks complicity.Frank flees, and the officers besiege the supermarket, with Skinner escaping in a police car with Frank. After Angel and Danny engage the offenders in a high-speed chase and shootout, Angel corners Skinner at Sandfords model village. After a fight, Skinner is impaled on a miniature church steeple. Frank attempts to escape in Angels car, but a swan that the pair had recaptured earlier attacks him. Angels former superiors ask him to return to London as the crime rate has risen heavily in his absence, but Angel declines and elects to remain in Sandford.While the officers are reviewing the paperwork of the many arrests, Tom Weaver, the last NWA member, enters the station wielding a blunderbuss. He shoots at Angel, but Danny takes the bullet. In the resulting struggle, Weaver accidentally activates the sea mine, killing himself and destroying the station. One year later, Angel has been promoted to Inspector and Danny, having survived, has been promoted to Sergeant. After visiting Irenes grave, the two drive to their next crime scene.",

            "plot": "The government of Pakistan decides to review unsolved cases pertaining to their Indian prisoners as a gesture of goodwill. Saamiya Siddiqui, a budding Pakistani lawyer, is given the defense of prisoner 786 as her first case. The prisoner, documented under the name Rajesh Rathore, has not spoken for twenty-two years. However, when Saamiya addresses him by his real name, Veer Pratap Singh, he breaks his silence and opens up to her about his story. Twenty-two years earlier, Zaara Hayaat Khan was a lively young Pakistani woman whose family has a political background and is of high standing in Lahore. Her engagement is arranged with Raza Shirazi, a wealthy and influential lawyer. Zaara travels to India to fulfill the last wish of her Sikh nanny: to have her ashes scattered in the Sutlej River. Her bus met with an accident. Veer, then an Indian Air Force pilot and a Punjabi Sikh, rescues Zaara and helps her complete her nannys final wish. She accompanies him to his village to celebrate the festival of Lohri, where she meets his loving aunt and uncle, who raised him. The next day, Veer takes Zaara to the train station for her return to Pakistan and is shocked to see her fianc\u00e9 Raza there to accompany her. Veer confesses that he has fallen in love with her, accepting that they cannot be together. Both depart, believing they will never meet again. Amidst her wedding preparations back home, Zaara realises that she too is in love with Veer. Her mother, however, is against this, as marrying Raza will further her fathers political career. Zaaras friend Shabbo secretly calls Veer, begging him to take Zaara away. He promptly quits the Indian Air Force and arrives in Pakistan. Zaara tearfully runs into his arms, causing her father to fall ill with shock and anger. Zaaras mother begs Veer to leave Zaara, fearing for her fathers reputation and health. Veer respects this and attempts to return home but Raza, outraged and jealous, has him arrested by Pakistani police. He blackmails Veer with two choices: be imprisoned for life on charges of being an Indian spy, with Raza giving Zaara a life full of happiness, or walk free knowing that Raza will make Zaaras life a living hell. Veer sacrifices his freedom out of his deep love for Zaara and is imprisoned in Pakistan. Meanwhile, his return bus falls off a cliff, killing all the passengers, so he is presumed dead to the world. Veer requests Saamiya not to mention Zaara whilst fighting the case, believing that she must be married by now; he does not want to ruin her reputation or make her settled life difficult. Saamiya travels to his village to find someone who can prove his true identity. She is shocked to find Zaara and Shabbo at his home. Shabbo explains that after Zaara thought Veer died in the bus accident 22 years ago, she broke off the marriage with Raza with her fathers support. Her parents and Veers aunt and uncle all eventually passed away within a few years. With the Hayat Khan family basically perished, Zaara and Shabbo left Pakistan and settled in Veers village in India to fulfill Veers dream of developing their village further. Zaara is shocked to learn that Veer is alive. She accompanies Saamiya back to Pakistan, where the old lovers share an emotional reunion. Her statement and evidence in court prove Veers innocence and true identity. The judge frees him, apologizing on behalf of Pakistan. Veer and Zaara marry, bid goodbye to Saamiya at the Wagah border crossing, and return home, finally able to live their lives together.",

However, that recognition is contrasted by his exasperated next-door neighbours, some of whom are fed up with his un-neighbourly habits, such as revving his motorcycle early in the morning, urinating on his lemon tree, and not mowing his grass. Burt, however, has a long-time dream; to travel to the US and test his motorcycle\\'s capabilities at the Bonneville Speedway.However, while modifying his motorcycle, Burt suffers a heart attack. An ambulance takes him to the hospital and he is told he has angina, and is advised to take it easy and not to ride his motorcycle. Burt ignores this advice, and is given medication.Burt is finally able to save enough to travel by cargo ship to Los Angeles, working his passage as the cook, but when he arrives, he experiences bureaucracy, scepticism, and the indifference of big city people. It is his blunt but gregarious nature which overcomes each hurdle. He wins over the motel clerk, a cross-dresser named Tina, who assists him in clearing customs and helps him in buying a car. The car salesman allows Burt to use his workshop and junkyard to build a trailer, and later offers him a job after Burt fine-tunes a number of the cars on the lot. Burt declines the offer, however, and shortly afterwards begins his long trip to Utah.Along the way, Burt meets numerous helpful people, including highway police, a Native American man called Jake who aids him when his trailer fails, a woman named Ada who allows him to repair his trailer in her garage and briefly becomes his lover, and an Air Force pilot who is on leave from military service in Vietnam.He finally arrives at the Bonneville Salt Flats, only to be blocked by race officials for not registering his motorcycle for competition in advance, and not having the mandated safety equipment. In a show of sportsmanship, however, various competitors and fans in the Bonneville series intervene on his behalf, and he is eventually allowed to make a timed run. Despite various problems, he succeeds in his quest and sets a new land speed record at the 8th mile of his run; when he reaches 201.851 mph (324.847 kmh). By the end, his leg is burned by the exhaust, and he then falls with the motorcycle and skids to a stop, but he is able to return home to New Zealand as a hero. An epilogue describes that he went to Bonneville again nine times to compete and set new records.",

            "plot": "The film begins in 1968 with Johnny Cash performing at Folsom State Prison. As the audience of inmates cheered him on, Cash waited backstage near a table saw. The saw reminded him of his early life. Two decades earlier, in 1944, 12-year-old Johnny was raised on a cotton farm in Dyess, Arkansas, with his brother Jack, his abusive father Ray, his mother Carrie, and his two sisters. One day, Jack was killed in a sawmill accident while Johnny was out fishing. Ray blamed Johnny for Jack\\'s death, saying that the Devil took the wrong son. In 1950, Johnny Cash enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and was stationed in West Germany. While there, he purchased a guitar and found solace in writing songs, including Folsom Prison Blues which he developed in 1952. After his discharge from the military in 1954, Johnny Cash returned to the United States and married his girlfriend, Vivian Liberto. The couple moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where Cash worked as a door-to-door salesman to support his growing family, but with little success. One day, Johnny Cash was walking past a recording studio when he was inspired to form a band to play gospel music. He and his band auditioned for Sam Phillips, the owner of Sun Records. Phillips signed them after they played Folsom Prison Blues. The band then toured as Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two, along with other rising stars Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Johnny Cash meets country music singer and songwriter June Carter while on tour, and is immediately smitten. He tries to woo her, but she gently rebuffs his attempts. Despite this, they become friends. As Johnny grew up, he begins abusing drugs and alcohol. Johnny Cash persuades June Carter to go on tour with him, over the objections of Johnny\\'s manager, Vivian Liberto. The tour is a success, but backstage Vivian becomes critical of June\\'s influence over Johnny. After one performance in Las Vegas, Johnny and June sleep together. The next morning, June notices Johnny taking pills and begins to doubt her choice to be with him. At their concert that evening, Johnny is upset by June\\'s apparent rejection and behaves erratically. He eventually passes out on stage. June is upset with Johnny\\'s behavior and decides to dispose of his drugs. She begins to write Ring of Fire as a way to describe her feelings for him and the pain she feels as she watches him descend into addiction. After returning to California, Johnny Cash traveled to Mexico to purchase more drugs. He was arrested, and his marriage to Vivian imploded. They divorced, and he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1966. Johnny Cash buys a large house near a lake in Hendersonville, Tennessee, in an attempt to reconcile with his wife, June Carter Cash. Ray, Johnny\\'s father, and other members of the extended Carter family arrive for Thanksgiving. Ray and Johnny get into an argument, and June\\'s mother urges June to help Cash. Cash goes into detox and awakens next to June, who says they have been given a second chance. They begin a tentative relationship, but June resists Cash\\'s marriage proposals. Johnny Cash performs I Got Stripes on stage. The song is so powerful that it causes Johnny to collapse on stage, accompanied by June Carter. Johnny Cash recorded an album live at Folsom Prison after discovering that most of his fan mail was from prisoners. The performance was a success, and Johnny embarked on a tour with June and his band. He later performed Ring of Fire on stage. At the end of the film, Johnny Cash invites June Carter to join him for a duet. He stops in the middle of the song and tells her that he can\\'t sing Jackson anymore unless she agrees to marry him. June accepts, and they share a passionate embrace on stage. Later, Johnny and his father reconcile their relationship while they are with their families.",

            "plot": "An unnamed young man lives an ethereal existence that lacks transitions between everyday events and eventually progresses toward an existential crisis. He observes quietly but later participates actively in philosophical discussions involving other characters \u2014 ranging from quirky scholars and artists to everyday restaurantgoers and friends \u2014 about such issues as metaphysics, free will, social philosophy, and the meaning of life. Other scenes do not even include the protagonists presence but rather focus on a random isolated person, a group of people, or a couple engaging in such topics from a disembodied perspective. Along the way, the film also touches upon existentialism, situationist politics, posthumanity, the film theory of Andr\u00e9 Bazin, and lucid dreaming, and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name. Gradually, the protagonist begins to realize that he is living out a perpetual dream, broken up only by occasional false awakenings. So far, he is mostly a passive onlooker, though this changes during a chat with a passing woman who suddenly approaches him. After she greets him and shares her creative ideas with him, he reminds himself that she is a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterward, he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters, but he begins to despair about being trapped in a dream. The protagonists final talk is with a character (played by Richard Linklater) whom he briefly encountered previously in the film. This last conversation reveals this other characters view that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time (and, thus, life); that living is simply the individuals constant negation of Gods invitation to become one with the universe; that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality; and that in order to be free from the illusion called life, the individual need only accept Gods invitation. The protagonist is last seen walking into a driveway when he suddenly begins to levitate, paralleling a scene at the start of the film of a floating child in the same driveway. The protagonist uncertainly reaches toward a cars handle but is too swiftly lifted above the vehicle and over the trees. He rises into the endless blue expanse of the sky until he disappears from view.",

            "plot": "In 1981, a group of former football coaches and players attend a funeral for  a former football player.Ten years earlier in the summer of 1971, head coach Bill Yoast of the newly integrated T. C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia, is leading his white players in summer workouts. He is informed that Herman Boone, a Black head coach originally hired to coach the citys black high school football team, has been assigned to his coaching staff instead. Then, in an attempt to placate rising racial tensions and the fact that all other high schools in Alexandria are whites only (despite the abolition of racial segregation in public schools), the school district decides to name Boone the head coach. Boone refuses, believing it is unfair to Yoast, a successful coach who is nominated to the Virginia High School Hall of Fame, but relents after seeing what it means to the Black community. When Yoast tells his white players that he will accept a head-coach position elsewhere, they pledge to boycott the team if he is not their coach. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind and decides to accept Boones offer to serve as his defensive coordinator.Boone holds his first team meeting with mostly Black students in the school gymnasium but is interrupted by the arrival of Yoast and several white students. Yoast informs Boone of his decision, but Boone warns Yoast that the Titans are his team, and he will not tolerate Yoast undermining him. On August 15, the players go to Gettysburg College for training camp. Early on, the Black and white team members frequently clash in racially-motivated conflicts, especially between defensive captains Gerry Bertier (white) and Julius Campbell (Black). However, through forceful coaching, rigorous training, and a motivational early-morning run to the Gettysburg National Cemetery followed by an emotional speech by Boone, the team comes together and returns as a united group. Before their first game, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be dismissed. Subsequently, the Titans go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice and slowly gaining support from the community.Just before the state semi-finals, Yoast is told by the chairman of the school board that they have arranged for the Titans to lose so that Boone will be dismissed and Yoast reinstated as head coach. During the game, the referees make several biased calls against the Titans. Upon seeing the chairman and other board members in the audience looking on with satisfaction, Yoast marches onto the field to warn the head referee that if the game is not officiated fairly, he will expose the scandal to the press. After this, the Titans shut out their opponents and advance to the state championship, but Yoast is told by the infuriated chairman that his actions in saving Boones job have resulted in the loss of his Hall of Fame nomination.That night, while celebrating the victory, Gerry is severely injured in a car accident and is paralyzed from the waist down. Despite the loss of the All-American linebacker, the Titans mount a comeback in the fourth quarter of the state championship and win the title.Ten years later, after he has won the gold medal in shot put in the Paralympic Games, Gerry dies in another car crash caused by a drunk driver. It is his funeral that the former football coaches and players were attending in the opening scene. Julius, whom Gerrys mother formerly disliked, is now holding her hand as he leads the team in a mournful rendition of Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye.In the epilogue, descriptions show the players and coaches activities after the events in 1971. Coach Boone coached the Titans for five more seasons before retirement, while Coach Yoast assisted Boone for four more years, retiring from coaching in 1990; the two coaches became good friends. After Gerrys death, the gymnasium at T.C. Williams High was renamed after him. Julius would work for the city of Alexandria and remain friends with Gerry until his death.",

            "plot": "In December 1995, Chuck Noland is a FedEx systems analyst who travels the world resolving productivity problems. He lives with his girlfriend, Kelly Frears in Memphis, Tennessee. The two talk of getting married but keep experiencing setbacks due to Chuck being constantly called away to work, which also starts to put a strain on their relationship. During a Christmas dinner, Chuck is summoned to resolve a problem in Malaysia. Before leaving, Kelly gives Chuck her grandfather\\'s pocket watch with a photo of her in it. He gives her a small box, saying she can wait to open it on New Year\\'s Eve when he returns, implying it is an engagement ring. The FedEx cargo plane Chuck boards crashes into the Pacific Ocean during a violent storm. He is the only survivor, washing ashore on an uninhabited island. Chuck gathers and sorts the FedEx packages that wash ashore. Chuck buries the body of one of the pilots that washes up on the coast. In the following days, Chuck struggles to locate food and water. He unsuccessfully tries to escape the island on a life raft, but is prevented by the tide and injures his leg. Realizing it is unlikely he will be rescued, Chuck opens most of the packages, finding useful items he uses to improve his living conditions. However, he does not open a package with pink angel wings painted on it. While attempting to start a fire, Chuck cuts his hand and furiously throws several objects including a Wilson volleyball, leaving a bloodstained handprint. He draws a face into the blood, names the ball Wilson and begins talking to it. Chuck realizes the chances of his rescue are low due to the wide search area, and decides to perform his own tooth extraction using a rock and an ice skate. Four years later, Chuck, now bearded and disheveled, has adapted to life alone on the island. After a section from a portable toilet enclosure washes up, he begins constructing a raft, which he successfully launches past the surf with Wilson, the unopened FedEx package and his belongings in tow. Chuck survives a storm, but afterward, Wilson falls off the raft and floats away. He unsuccessfully attempts to rescue Wilson and is left to grieve his loss. Soon after, he is rescued by a passing cargo ship. Four weeks later, Chuck is cleaned up and returned to the mainland, where he learns he was presumed dead by his family and friends. He is given a hero\\'s welcome home party at the FedEx Headquarters in Memphis, where he learns that Kelly has since married and has a daughter. Kelly is emotionally unable to greet Chuck at his homecoming party. One night, Chuck visits Kelly, where they bond for the last time; the two share a passionate kiss and confess their love for each other, but they both realize she cannot leave her family, and they part ways, with Chuck returning the watch Kelly gave him. Chuck drives to Texas to return the angel-winged package to its sender. Finding no one home, he leaves it at the door with a note saying the package saved his life. He departs in his vehicle and stops at a remote crossroads. A woman in a pickup truck, headed in the direction of the house, stops and gives information about where each road leads. As she drives away, Chuck notices the two angel wings painted on the tailgate of her truck. He looks down each road, trying to decide which way to go, before he notices the wind is blowing back down the road where the woman drove, and turns back to her direction with a smile.",

            "plot": "In Boston, Irish American fraternal twin brothers Connor and Murphy MacManus attend Mass, where the priest mentions the fate of Kitty Genovese. Later, while Connor and Murphy are celebrating Saint Patricks Day with friends, three Russian mobsters arrive and try to shut down the pub so they can demolish it for the valuable land underneath. Despite Connor and Murphys attempt to talk them down, a brawl ensues, in which the Russians are defeated and humiliated. The next morning, when two of the Russians seek revenge, the brothers beat them to death in selfdefense. FBI Special Agent Paul Smecker is assigned to the case and finds that the police and the press see the MacManus twins as heroes. The duo turn themselves in at a police station, where Smecker interviews them. After the twins retell their incident to Smecker, he declines to press charges and allows them to spend the night in a holding cell to avoid attention from the media. That night, they receive a calling from God telling them to hunt down wicked men so that the innocent will flourish. Connor learns that a local hotel is hosting a meeting of the Russian mob. Having equipped themselves with weaponry from an underground gun dealer, the twins kill nine Russian mobsters, while Rocco, a friend of the twins and errand boy for local mafia boss Giuseppe Papa Joe Yakavetta, surprises them after being sent by his boss to carry out a hit. Realizing that he was set up, Rocco agrees to help Connor and Murphy. That night, they hunt down and kill Vincenzo Lapazzi, Papa Joes underboss, at a peep show. Falsely believing that Rocco is behind the murders, Papa Joe hires the legendary hitman, Il Duce, to deal with the problem. Rocco takes revenge on his former crew and convinces the twins to shoot up a gambling den so he can execute a criminal he was once forced to assist in a heinous crime. The three men are then ambushed by Il Duce. Although they manage to escape, the three men suffer serious wounds, including the loss of Roccos finger. Hours later, as the police secure the crime scene, the investigation seems futile since the twins covered their tracks by spraying any blood left behind with ammonia. However, Smecker happens upon Roccos finger and analyzes it, eventually tracing the clues back to Rocco and his allies. This leaves Smecker in a difficult conundrum; he struggles with the choice of whether to prosecute the three men or join them in their cause as he believes they are doing the right thing. After getting drunk at a gay bar and subsequently taking advice from a reluctant priest, Smecker decides to help the trio. Later, the twins and Rocco inform Smecker that they plan to assassinate Papa Joe at his mansion, but Smecker learns that they are walking into a trap. The twins are captured, and Rocco is shot and killed by Papa Joe. As Papa Joe leaves, Smecker arrives disguised as a prostitute and tries to rescue them before being knocked unconscious by Il Duce. While the twins say their family prayer over Rocco, Il Duce enters the room and prepares to open fire. However, he instead finishes the prayer \u2013 revealing he is the twins father and deciding to join his sons in their mission. Three months later, Papa Joe is on trial for the third time. However, the reporters onscene anticipate his acquittal. The twins and Il Duce, aided by Smecker, Dolly, Duffy and Greenly, infiltrate the courthouse and take the spectators hostage. Unmasked, they make a speech stating that they intend to eradicate evil wherever they find it before reciting their family prayer and publicly executing Papa Joe. The media dubs the three as the Saints.",

            "plot": "In October 1957, news of the Soviets launch of Sputnik 1 reaches Homer Hickam in the mining community of Coalwood, West Virginia, who is inspired to build his own rockets despite the skepticism of his friends and family, especially his father; John Hickam, who strictly wanted Homer to work in the mines. Homer teams up with math geek Quentin Wilson, who shares an interest in aerospace engineering; with the support of friends Roy Lee Cooke and Sherman ODell, and their science teacher Freida J Riley, they construct small rockets. When one of their rockets lands near Johns office and nearly injures some workers, John reprimands Homer not to build rockets on his property again. The boys hike to the edge of the coal companys property, where they succeed with the help of the townsfolk, including the mines machine shop manager, Ike Bykovsky, who is punished by John for helping the boys and sent to work in the mine. The rocket launches begin attracting townsfolk. However, the boys abandon rocketry after they are accused by the police of starting a wildfire with a stray rocket and are arrested. In a mining accident, John is injured and Bykovsky is killed, devastating Homer. He drops out of high school to work in the mine and provide for his family while his father recovers. Homer is inspired by Miss Riley to read a book on applied rocket science, learning to calculate the trajectory of a rocket. Using this, he and Quentin locate their missing rocket and prove it could not have caused the fire. The boys present their findings to Miss Riley and the school principal, Mr. Turner, who determines the cause was a flare from a nearby airfield. Homer tells his father he is returning to high school and no longer wants to work in the mine. The boys return to rocketry and win the school science fair. When the opportunity arises for one of them to participate in the National Science Fair in Indianapolis, they elect Homer. The miners union goes on strike against the coal company. With the mines set to close and resenting his fathers pressures, Homer storms out of the house, vowing never to return. At the National Science Fair, Homers display is well-received. Overnight, someone steals his machined rocket part model  the de Laval nozzle  and his autographed picture of Dr. Wernher von Braun. Homer makes an urgent phone call home to his mother Elsie, who implores John to end the strike so that Mr. Bolden, Bykovskys replacement, can use the machine shop to build a replacement nozzle. John relents when Elsie, fed up with his lack of support for their son, threatens to leave him. With the towns support and replacement parts sent to Indianapolis, the boys win the top prize and Homer is bombarded with college scholarship offers. He returns to Coalwood as a hero and visits Miss Riley, who is dying of Hodgkin lymphoma. Preparing for the launch of their largest rocket yet, Homer asks his father to come and tells him that Von Braun is brilliant but is not his hero\u2014implying John is his true idol. At the launch of their rocket, named for Miss Riley, almost all of Coalwood turns out to watch. John is given the honor of pushing the launch button. The Miss Riley reaches an altitude of 30000 ft  higher than the summit of Mount Everest. As the town looks to the skies, John puts his hand on Homers shoulder and smiles, showing Homer that he is proud of him. An epilogue reveals the real-life outcomes of the main characters lives, noting that Miss Riley died, the mine closed, and all four Rocket Boys went to college, going on to successful careers, with Homer working at NASA.",

            "plot": "Yoshitaka Nishi is a violent former police detective who had to retire after a tragic accident during a botched arrest in which another detective, Tanaka, was killed by the suspect while two others, Nakamura and Horibe, were severely injured. Becoming unemployed, Nishi spends most of his time taking care of his sick wife Miyuki, who has terminal leukemia. To pay for his wifes care, Nishi borrows money from the yakuza but is having difficulty repaying them. Meanwhile, Horibe, who has been paralyzed since the incident, suffers deep depression after his wife and daughter leave him. In a conversation with Nishi, Horibe hints at committing suicide, while adding that he would like to paint but cannot afford to buy himself the necessary materials. After a botched suicide attempt, Horibe receives art supplies mailed to him by Nishi. He then takes up painting and creates surreal works of art, and later in a pointillist style. Nishi buys a second-hand taxicab and repaints it in police colors. He arms himself with a revolver and robs a bank dressed as a policeman. Using the money, he pays off the yakuza and gives some to Tanakas widow. Nishi then leaves with his wife for a road trip. Nakamura learns from Tanakas widow about the gift and advises her to keep the money. He also learns about the paints for Horibe and soon realizes who committed the robbery. Nakamura and his partner attempt to reach Nishi, eventually tracing his route as he and his wife embark on their trip. Meanwhile, even though Nishi has paid his debt to them, the yakuza deduce Nishi committed the robbery and attempt to extort additional money from him. The yakuza track down and confront Nishi, but he kills them all in a violent shootout. The next day, Nishi and his wife are at a beach when they are found by Nakamura and his partner. They prepare to arrest Nishi, but Nishi asks Nakamura to spare him a moment of time and lies alongside his wife on the beach. The couple comforts each other before the camera pans away towards the ocean before two gunshots are heard in the distance.",

            "plot": "In the not-too-distant future, eugenics is common. A genetic registry database uses biometrics to classify those so created as valids while those conceived naturally and more susceptible to genetic disorders are known as in-valids. Genetic discrimination is illegal, but in practice genotype profiling is used to identify valids to qualify for professional employment while in-valids are relegated to menial jobs. Vincent Freeman was conceived naturally, and his genetic profile indicates a high probability of several disorders and an estimated lifespan of 30.2 years. His parents, regretting their decision, use genetic selection in conceiving their second child, Anton Jr. Growing up, the two brothers often play a game of chicken by swimming out to sea as far as possible, with the first one returning to shore considered the loser; Vincent always loses. Vincent dreams of a career in space travel, but is always reminded of his genetic inferiority. One day, Vincent challenges Anton to a game of chicken and beats him. Anton starts to drown and is saved by Vincent. Shortly after, Vincent leaves home. Years later, Vincent works cleaning office spaces, including that of spaceflight conglomerate Gattaca Aerospace Corporation. He gets a chance to pose as a valid by using donated hair, skin, blood, and urine samples from former swimming star Jerome Eugene Morrow, who was paralyzed after being hit by a car. With Jerome\\'s genetic makeup, Vincent gains employment at Gattaca and is assigned as a navigator for an upcoming mission to Saturn\\'s moon Titan. To conceal his identity, Vincent must meticulously groom and scrub down daily to remove his own genetic material, pass daily DNA scanning and urine tests using Jerome\\'s samples, and hide his heart defect. When a Gattaca administrator is murdered a week before a possible launch, the police find one of Vincent\\'s eyelashes near the crime scene, but can only identify it as from an unregistered in-valid, and thus launch an investigation to find who owns the eyelash. During this, Vincent becomes close to a co-worker, Irene Cassini, and falls in love with her. Though a valid, Irene has a higher risk of heart failure that will bar her from any deep space mission. Vincent also learns that Jerome\\'s paralysis is self-inflicted; after placing silver in the Olympics, Jerome threw himself in front of a car. Jerome maintains that he was designed to be the best, yet somehow wasn\\'t, and is suffering because of this. Vincent repeatedly evades the grasp of the investigation. Finally, it is revealed that Gattaca\\'s mission director Josef killed the administrator because he threatened to cancel the mission. Vincent learns that the detective who closed the case was his brother Anton, who consequently has discovered Vincent\\'s presence. The brothers meet, and Anton warns Vincent about his illegal actions, but Vincent asserts that he has gotten to this position on his own merits. Anton challenges Vincent to a final game of chicken. As the two swim out at night, Vincent\\'s stamina surprises Anton, so Vincent reveals that he won by not saving energy for the swim back. Anton turns back and begins to drown, but Vincent rescues him and swims them back to shore. On the day of the launch, Jerome reveals that he has stored enough DNA samples for Vincent to last two lifetimes upon his return and gives him an envelope to open once in flight. After saying goodbye to Irene, Vincent prepares to board, but discovers there is a final genetic test, and he currently lacks any of Jerome\\'s samples. He is surprised when Dr. Lamar, who oversees background checks, reveals that he knows Vincent has been posing as a valid. Lamar admits that his son looks up to Vincent and wonders whether his son, who is genetically selected, but not all that they promised, could exceed his potential just as Vincent has. The doctor changes the test results, allowing Vincent to pass. As the rocket launches, Jerome dons his swimming medal and immolates himself in his home\\'s incinerator. Vincent opens the note to find a lock of Jerome\\'s hair.",

            "plot": "Bess McNeill is a young and pretty Scottish woman who has, in the past, had treatment for unspecified mental health illness after the death of her brother. She marries oil rig worker Jan Nyman, a Danish non-churchgoer, despite disapproval from her community and her Free Scottish Presbyterian Calvinist church. Bess is steadfast and pure of heart but quite simple and childlike in her beliefs. During her frequent visits to the church, she prays to God and carries on conversations with Him in her own voice, believing that He is responding directly through her. Bess is infatuated with Jan and has difficulty living without him when he is away on the oil platform. Jan makes occasional phone calls to Bess, in which they express their love and sexual desires. Bess grows needy and prays for his immediate return. The next day, Jan is severely injured in an industrial accident and is flown back to the mainland. Bess believes her prayer was the reason the accident occurred and that God was punishing her for her selfishness in asking him to neglect his job and return to her. No longer able to perform sexually and mentally affected by the paralysis, Jan asks Bess to find a lover. Bess is devastated and storms out. Jan then attempts to commit suicide and fails. He falls unconscious and is readmitted to the hospital. Jan's condition deteriorates. He urges Bess to find another lover and tell him the details, as it will be as if they are together and will revitalise his spirits. Though her sister-in-law Dodo constantly reassures her that nothing she does will affect his recovery, Bess begins to believe these suggestions are the will of God and in accordance with loving Jan wholly. Despite her repulsion and inner turmoil at the thought of being with other men, she perseveres in her own sexual debasement, believing it will save her husband. Bess throws herself at Jan's doctor, but when he rebuffs her, she takes to picking up men off the street and allowing herself to be brutalised in increasingly cruel sexual encounters. In the face of probable expulsion from her church, she proclaims, You cannot love words. You cannot be in love with a word. You can only love a human being. That's perfection. The entire village is scandalised by these doings, and Bess is excommunicated. Dodo and Jan's doctor agree the only way to keep Bess safe from herself is to have her committed and move as far away from her husband, whom they believe to be in terminal decline, as possible. Bess decides to make what she thinks is the ultimate sacrifice for Jan: she unflinchingly returns to a derelict ship, where sailors brutally attack her. Dodo and Mrs. McNeill meet a severely injured Bess in the hospital for the last time, forgiving her for her actions; Bess dies in Dodo's arms. Her church deems her soul to be lost and hell-bound. Unbeknownst to the church elders, Jan, and his friends have substituted bags of sand for Bess's body inside her sealed coffin. Without notice to the church elders, Dodo condemns them, saying no one has the right to consign Bess to hell. Later, Jan is shown, substantially restored to health despite the doctors not having thought it possible, burying Bess in the ocean, deep in grief. The film ends in magical realism as Bess's body is nowhere to be seen on the sonar, and church bells ring from on high in the sky.",

            "plot": "In the small town of Endora, Iowa, Gilbert Grape is busy caring for Arnie, his mentally disabled younger brother who is about to turn 18, as they wait for the many tourists trailers to pass through town during an annual gathering at a nearby recreational area. His father had hanged himself seventeen years earlier; since then, his mother, Bonnie, has spent most of her days on the couch watching television and eating. With Bonnies obesity leaving her unable to care for her children on her own, Gilbert has taken responsibility for repairing the old house and being protective of Arnie, who has a habit of climbing the towns water tower, as well as trees, while his sisters, Amy and Ellen, do the other housework. A new supermarket has opened, threatening the small Lamson\\'s Grocery where Gilbert works. Gilbert is having an affair with a married woman to whom he delivers groceries.  When her husband finds out, theres a horrible scene involving Gilbert, the mans children, and their wading pool.  The husband later dies from a heart attack and drowns in the wading pool. A young woman named Becky and her grandmother are stuck in town when the pulling their trailer breaks down. Gilberts unusual life circumstances threaten to get in the way of their budding romance. To spend time with Becky to watch the sunset, Gilbert leaves Arnie alone in the bath. He returns home late and finds Arnie still in the bath the following morning, shivering in the now-cold water; his guilt is compounded by his familys anger and Arnies subsequent aquaphobia. Becky becomes close to both Gilbert and Arnie. While they are distracted during one of their talks, Arnie returns to the water tower that he is always trying to climb. Arnie is arrested after being rescued from the top of the tower, causing Bonnie \u2014 who has not left the house in more than seven years \u2014 to become the laughing stock of the town as she goes to the police station, forcing Arnies release. Soon, Arnie ruins two birthday cakes: the first, which Amy has lovingly made, accidentally; and the second, a replacement from FoodLand, which he dips into, having found it in the refrigerator. Arnie tries to run away from his bath, and in his frustration, Gilbert finally snaps, hitting Arnie several times. Guilty and appalled at himself, Gilbert flees, driving away in his truck. Arnie also runs to Becky, who takes care of him for the evening, and helps him overcome his aquaphobia, until he is picked up by his sisters. After some soulsearching, aided by Becky, Gilbert returns home during Arnies 18th birthday party to make amends to his family for running out, and to receive Arnies reluctant forgiveness. He also apologizes to his mother for his behavior, and vows not to be ashamed of her or let her be hurt anymore. She acknowledges how much of a burden that she has become to the family, and he forgives her. Gilbert also introduces Bonnie to Becky, something he had been reluctant to do. Following the party, Bonnie climbs the stairs to her bedroom for the first time since her husbands suicide. Arnie tries to wake her, but discovers that she has died. With no way to remove her body from the second floor, the police make plans to return with a crane the next day. The family instinctively knows that there will be a crowd of people there to get a laugh, instead of paying their respects. Wanting to keep her death from becoming a mockery, the family removes the furniture and belongings from the house, after which Gilbert lights a match to burn the house to the ground with her body still inside. A year later, Amy gets a job managing a bakery in the area, while Ellen looks forward to switching schools and living in a bigger city. Gilbert waits by the side of the road with Arnie, waiting for the tourist trailers to come again. As part of the convoy, Becky arrives with her grandmother and picks them both up. Gilbert tells Arnie, We can go anywhere.\"",

            "plot": "In the late spring of 1962, fifth-grader Scott Smalls moves to the San Fernando Valley, right outside of Los Angeles with his widowed mother, and recent stepfather, Bill. As school ends and summer begins, Small\\'s mother encourages him to make friends, and he tries to join a group of boys who play baseball daily at the neighborhood sandlot\u2014brothers Timmy and Tommy Timmons, Michael Squints Palledorous, Alan Yeah-Yeah McClennan, Bertram Grover Weeks, pitcher Kenny DeNunez, catcher Hamilton Ham Porter, and their leader and best player Benny Rodriguez. Everyone but Benny laughs at Smalls lack of ability, and an attempt to play catch with his stepdad Bill injures Smalls and leaves him with a black eye. But, Benny still invites him onto the team and helps him improve his skills and earn the boys respect. When DeNunez taunts Ham with his trademark pitch, The Heater, Ham hits a home run into an adjacent backyard, and the team is dismayed. However, they stop Smalls from retrieving the ball and tell him of the Beast, a legendarily fearsome English Mastiff living behind the fence. According to Squints, in 1942, Mr. Mertle, the owner of the property, bought a young dog, and it grew increasingly big and vicious, until Squints grandfather, who was chief of police at the time, presented Mr. Mertle with a court order to keep the Beast chained up. In the years since, many baseballs have gone over the fence, but every one has been claimed by the Beast. One particularly hot day, the team opts to go swimming at the neighborhood pool, in lieu of baseball. While there, Squints fakes drowning to receive mouth-to-mouth resuscitation from lifeguard Wendy Peffercorn, with whom he has a crush; he kisses her, and she kicks the boys out, but as they leave Wendy waves at Squints with a warm smile. The team plays a Fourth of July night game by the light of fireworks, and Smalls observes that, to Benny, baseball was life. They later play against a snooty rival Little League team, and win. They later celebrate at a fair, where a combination of chewing tobacco obtained by Bertram and riding the Trabant causes a huge sickly mess. One day, Benny hits the cover off the team\\'s only ball, much to the team\\'s amazement. With Bill away on business for a week, Smalls opts to keep the game going, by borrowing his prized baseball autographed by Babe Ruth. Unaware of its value, he hits his first home run, sending it into the Beast\\'s yard. When the team learns of the autograph, they quickly buy another baseball, and forge Babe Ruth\\'s signature on it, to be a temporary replacement, while they come up with a plan to rescue the autographed ball. Smalls suggests going to Mr. Mertle for assistance, but Squints insists Mr. Mertle will not help them. The team attempts to recover the lost ball with various makeshift devices, but each attempt is thwarted by the Beast. As Smalls prepares to accept his fate, Benny dreams of the spirit of Babe Ruth, who advises him to rescue the ball himself. Heroes get remembered, says the Babe, but legends never die. Follow your heart, kid, and you\\'ll never go wrong. Equipped with a new pair of PF Flyers, Benny retrieves the ball by pickling the Beast and leaping back over the fence, but the dog breaks its chain and chases him through town. Benny races back to Mr. Mertle\\'s yard, but the Beast crashes through the fence, and it falls down on top of the dog. Smalls and Benny free the dog, who gratefully licks Smalls face and leads them to its stash of baseballs. The two meet Mr. Mertle, who turns out to have been a baseball player and friendly rival of Babe Ruth, having lost his sight after being struck by a pitch. He kindly trades them the chewed-up ball for one autographed by all the Murderer\\'s Row, and asks them to visit every week to talk baseball. Bill loves the Murderer\\'s Row ball, but still grounds Smalls for a week for taking and ruining his autographed ball. Their relationship improves and Smalls begins to call him Dad. The boys continue to play on the sandlot the rest of that summer, and several subsequent summers with the Beast \u2013 whose real name is Hercules \u2013 as their mascot. As the years pass, they eventually go their separate ways: Yeah-Yeah enlists in the army, and later develops bungee jumping; Bertram disappears into the counterculture movement; Timmy and Tommy become wealthy upon inventing mini-malls; Squints marries Wendy, has nine kids with her and the two run the local drug store; Ham becomes a professional wrestler: The Great Hambino; DeNunez plays triple-A baseball, but later owns a business, and coaches his sons Little League team: The Heaters; and Benny earns the nickname the Jet after word spreads around about his encounter with the Beast. As an adult, Smalls becomes a sports commentator and remains friends with Benny, now a player for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Performing the play-by-play for a Dodgers game, Smalls cheers Benny on as he steals home to win the game, and they give each other the same thumbs-up sign they have shared since childhood. In Smalls dugout, he owns, and keeps on display: the chewed-up Babe Ruth autographed ball, the Murderer\\'s Row ball, the forged Babe Ruth ball, some of Bill\\'s pictures of Babe Ruth, and a large picture of the Sandlot kids from 1962.",

            "plot": "As evening falls, tomboy cabby Corky picks up Hollywood executive Victoria Snelling from the airport, and as Corky drives, Victoria tries to conduct business on her phone. Despite their extreme differences socially, the two develop a certain connection. When Victoria suggests that cab driving is not much of a career, Corky counters that her dream in fact is to become a mechanic. During the ride, Victoria, who is a casting agent, comes to realise that Corky would be ideal for a part in a movie she is casting, but Corky rejects the offer because she intends to be a mechanic. The taxi is a 1985 Chevrolet Caprice Classic Wagon. Helmut, an immigrant from East Germany who was a clown in his home country, has found work as a taxi driver. After dark, he picks up a passenger named YoYo, a streetwise young man who wants to go to Brooklyn. Increasingly alarmed at Helmets inability to handle an automatic transmission, ignorance of New York geography, and feeble command of the English language, YoYo takes over the wheel. During the drive, YoYo sees his sister-in-law Angela on the street and forces her into the cab to take her back home. Helmut is clearly amused by the vituperation between the two. After Angela and Yoyo depart, Helmut struggles to drive back to Manhattan, muttering New York... New York. The taxi is a 1983 Ford LTD Crown Victoria. At night, a cab picks up two drunk African diplomats, who mock the lowly driver and find it hilarious that he is from the Ivory Coast. In French, when he says he is ivorien, they say il voit rien he cant see a thing. Sick of their insults, he throws them out, forgetting to get money off them. Next he picks up an attractive young woman, who is blind. As she cannot see the colour of his skin, he asks her where she thinks he is from. After a moments thought, she says the Ivory Coast. Prickly and sexually provocative, she rejects most of his efforts to be friendly, regarding him as beneath her, but he is genuinely fascinated by her and her predicament. So much so that, after dropping her off, he watches her walk beside a canal in the dark and he drives into another car, whose driver angrily accuses him of being blind. The taxi is a 1980 Peugeot 504. In the early morning hours, an eccentric cabbie picks up a priest. As he drives, he starts to confess his sins. Much to the priests discomfort, he goes into great detail about how he discovered his sexuality, first with a pumpkin and then with a sheep, then details a love affair he had with his brothers wife, miming the actions and mouthing the cries. Already ailing, overwhelmed by the barrage of unwanted information, the priest has a fatal heart attack. Unable to revive him, the cabbie leaves him on a bench to be found once it is light. The taxi is a 1976 Fiat 128. After an evening spent drinking heavily, three workers, one of whom has just been fired from his job and has passed out, climb into a cab to return home. On the way, the two conscious workers talk about the terrible situation their unconscious friend is in, being out of work and having to face a divorce and a pregnant daughter. The driver, Mika, then tells them all about how he and his wife had been trying for a baby for a long time. When his wife finally got pregnant, the baby was born early and had to be placed in an incubator and the doctor told them the baby would only live a week. The baby lived a few weeks longer than expected, giving Mika and his wife hope. However, the baby eventually died. The workers are terribly moved and depressed by the story, and even become unsympathetic toward their drunken, laid-off companion. Leaving him in the cab, they stagger off to their homes. Mika wakes him, takes payment and leaves. Worker sits on the ground, passing neighbours greet him and he replies back. The taxi is a 1973 Volvo 144.",

After Tre gets into a fight at school, his teacher informs Reva that although intelligent, he lacks maturity and respect. Concerned about Tres future, Reva sends him to live in the Crenshaw neighborhood of South Central with his father, Jason Furious Styles Jr, hoping Tre will learn life lessons from him. Although strict, Furious is also caring and attentive.In Crenshaw, Tre reunites with his childhood friends Darrin Doughboy Baker, Doughboys half-brother Ricky, and their friend Chris. One night, Furious calls the LAPD after shooting at a burglar with his revolver, and a civil and professional white police officer named Graham and a hostile and self-hating black police officer named Coffey arrive an hour later. The next day at Chris suggestion, Tre and his friends go to witness a dead body, after which a group of older boys harasses them. Later on, en route back from a fishing trip, Tre and Furious notice Doughboy and Chris being arrested for theft.Seven years later, Doughboy, now a Rollin 60s Crips member, is released from prison. Attending his welcome home party are Chris, now paraplegic due to a gunshot wound, and new friends and fellow Crip members Dookie and Monster. Ricky, now a star running back at Crenshaw High School who hopes to earn a university scholarship, lives with his mother Brenda, girlfriend Shanice, and their toddler son. A visiting USC recruiter implores him to score at least a 700 on the SAT  to qualify for the scholarship. Meanwhile, Tre, now a mature and responsible teenager, hopes to attend college with his girlfriend Brandi.Later during a street gathering on Crenshaw Blvd, Ferris, a Crenshaw Mafia Bloods member, provokes Ricky. Everybody comes to Rickys defense, before Doughboy confronts Ferris and brandishes his Colt Double Eagle, leading to an argument between the gangs. Cooler heads prevail until Ferris fires an automatic MAC-10 into the air, forcing everybody to flee. Afterwards, Tre and Ricky are pulled over by an LAPD patrol car where Coffey threateningly holds his gun at Tres throat. A distraught Tre ventures to Brandis house, where he breaks down. After she comforts him, they have sexual intercourse for the first time.The next afternoon, Brenda asks Ricky to run an errand, and Ricky encounters and brawls with Doughboy, with Brenda taking Rickys side, and berating Doughboy. As he and Tre depart, Rickys SAT results are delivered. The duo notice Ferris and the Bloods driving around and cut through back alleys to avoid them before splitting up; unfortunately, the Bloods approach Ricky, one of whom fatally shoots him in the leg and chest with a sawed off shotgun, killing him. A distraught Doughboy helps Tre carry Rickys bloodied corpse home; afterwards, Brenda and Shanice, both devastated by Rickys death, tearfully blame Doughboy for instigating the shooting. Later, Brenda discovers that Ricky scored a 710, enough to qualify for the scholarship he sought.Angered, the remaining boys vow vengeance on the Bloods. Furious finds Tre preparing to take his gun but seemingly convinces him to abandon his plans for revenge; moments later, he and Brandi catch Tre sneaking out to join Doughboy, Dookie and  Monster. Later, as the gang drives around the city, Tre comes to his senses, quits and returns home. After the gang coincidentally locates the Bloods at a local diner, Monster guns down the fleeing trio with an AK-47 he bought, murdering one of them by shooting him three times in the back, while Doughboy executes Rickys killer, shooting him once in the spine, and Ferris twice in the head in a vengeful situation. Later that evening, when Tre arrives home, he and Furious silently stare at each other before entering their bedrooms for the night.The next morning, Doughboy visits Tre, understanding Tres reasons for abandoning the gang. Knowing he will face retaliation for killing Ferris and accepting the consequences of his crime-ridden life, Doughboy questions why most people dont know, dont show, or dont care about whats going on in the hood and laments Rickys death. Tre embraces him as a surrogate brother.As Doughboy leaves and Tre goes back into his house, a postscript reveals that Ricky was buried the next day, Doughboy was murdered two weeks later, and Tre ultimately attended college with Brandi in Atlanta.",

            "plot": "In 1969, Dr. Malcolm Sayer is a dedicated and caring physician at a local hospital in the Bronx borough of New York City. After working extensively with the catatonic patients who survived the 19191930 epidemic of encephalitis lethargica, Sayer discovers that certain stimuli will reach beyond the patients respective catatonic states; actions, such as catching a ball, hearing familiar music, being called by their name, and enjoying human touch, all have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds. Patient Leonard Lowe seems to remain unmoved, but Sayer learns that Leonard is able to communicate with him by using a Ouija board. After attending a lecture at a conference on the drug L-DOPA and its success for patients with Parkinsons disease, Sayer believes that the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients. A trial run with Leonard yields astounding results; Leonard completely awakens from his catatonic state. This success inspires Sayer to ask for funding from donors, so that all the catatonic patients can receive the L-DOPA medication and gain awakenings to reality and the present. Meanwhile, Leonard is adjusting to his new life, and becomes romantically interested in Paula, the daughter of another hospital patient. Leonard begins to chafe at the restrictions placed on him as a patient of the hospital, desiring the freedom to come and go as he pleases. He stirs up a revolt by arguing his case to Sayer and the hospital administration. As Leonard becomes more agitated, Sayer notices that a number of facial and body tics begin to manifest, which Leonard has difficulty controlling. Although Sayer and the hospital staff are thrilled by the success of L-DOPA with this group of patients, they soon learn that it is a temporary result. As the first to awaken, Leonard is also the first to demonstrate the limited duration of this period of awakening. Leonards tics gradually grow more prominent, and he starts to shuffle as he walks. All the patients are forced to witness what will eventually happen to them. Leonard soon begins to have full body spasms and can hardly move. He tolerates the pain, and asks Sayer to film him, with the hope that he would someday contribute to research that may help others. Leonard acknowledges what is happening to him, and has a last lunch with Paula, at which he tells her that he cannot see her anymore. When he is about to leave, Paula dances with him. For this short period of time, his spasms disappear. Leonard and Sayer reconcile their differences, but Leonard soon returns to his catatonic state. The other patients fears are similarly realized, as each eventually returns to catatonia, no matter how much their L-DOPA dosages are increased. Sayer tells a group of hospital grant donors that, although the awakening did not last, another kind \u2014 one of learning to appreciate and live life \u2014 occurred. For example, he overcomes his painful shyness and asks Nurse Eleanor Costello to go out for coffee, many months after he had declined a similar invitation from her. The nurses treat the catatonic patients with more respect and care, and Paula visits Leonard. Sayer and Leonard continue to communicate with the Ouija board.",

He persuades Marty McFly and his girlfriend, Jennifer Parker, to travel to the future with him and help their future children, with Biff Tannen witnessing their departure. Once they arrive in 2015, Doc incapacitates Jennifer, leaving her asleep in an alley to avoid letting her learn about her own future. Doc explains that their son Marty Jr. will be arrested for participating in a robbery with Biffs grandson Griff, leading to a chain of events that destroys the McFly family.Doc instructs Marty to switch places with the identical Marty Jr. and refuse Griffs offer, but Griff goads Marty into a fight by calling him chicken, and a subsequent hoverboard chase ensues. Griff and his gang are arrested, saving Martys future children. Before rejoining Doc, Marty purchases an almanac containing the results of major sporting events from 1950 to 2000. Doc discovers it and warns Marty about profiting from time travel. Before Doc can adequately dispose of it, they are interrupted by the police, who have found Jennifer incapacitated and are taking her to her 2015 home. They pursue, as does an elderly Biff, who has overheard their conversation and retrieved the discarded almanac.Jennifer wakes up in her 2015 home and hides from the McFly family. She overhears that her future life with Marty is not what she expected, due to his involvement in an automobile accident, and witnesses Marty being goaded by his co-worker, Douglas Needles, into a shady business deal, resulting in the loss of his job. Jennifer tries to escape the house but faints after encountering her 2015 self. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Marty and Doc, Biff steals the time machine and returns it. Marty and Doc return to 1985, leaving an unconscious Jennifer on her front porch to sleep off the days events as a dream.Marty gradually realizes that the 1985 they have returned to is not the one he knows. Biff, having used the almanac to secure a fortune, is now one of the countrys wealthiest and most corrupt men. He has turned Hill Valley into a chaotic dystopia, secretly murdered Martys father, George, in 1973, and forced Martys mother, Lorraine, to marry him. Meanwhile, this timelines version of Doc has been committed to a mental hospital. Doc deduces that old Biff took the time machine to give his younger self the almanac, and Marty learns from the alternate 1985 Biff that he received it on November 12, 1955. Biff, acting on his future selfs advice, tries to kill Marty, but he flees with Doc to 1955.Marty secretly follows the 1955 Biff and watches him receive the almanac from his 2015 self. Marty then follows him to the high school dance, carefully avoiding interrupting the events from his previous visit, and being forced to intervene when Biffs gang goes after the other Marty performing onstage. Marty finally gets the almanac, but loses it after being again goaded into a fight with Biff. Marty chases after Biffs car on the hoverboard, getting the almanac back as Biff is left to crash into a manure truck for the second time in a week.Marty burns the almanac, nullifying the changes to the timeline that it had caused, as Doc hovers above in the time machine. Before Marty can join him, the DeLorean is struck by lightning and disappears. A Western Union courier arrives immediately after and delivers a letter to Marty; it is from Doc, who tells him that the lightning strike transported him seventy years in the past to 1885. Marty races back into town to find the 1955 Doc, who had just helped the other Marty to return to 1985. Shocked by Martys sudden reappearance, Doc faints.",

            "plot": "In 1964, three civil rights workers \u2013 two Jewish and one black \u2013 go missing while they are in Jessup County, Mississippi, organizing a voter registry for African Americans. The FBI sends Alan Ward and Rupert Anderson to investigate. Ward is a Northerner, senior in rank but much younger than Anderson, and approaches the investigation by the book. In contrast, Anderson, a former Mississippi sheriff, is more nuanced in his approach. The pair find it difficult to conduct interviews with the local townspeople, as Sheriff Ray Stuckey and his deputies influence the public and are linked to a branch of the Ku Klux Klan.With the help of the son of a local pastor, the FBI is finally able to bring forward a witness who saw Klansmen firebomb a house, and three white men are arrested and tried for felony arson. A local judge, however, gives the men a token suspended sentence while deriding the FBI as outside agitators who provoked the men to violence. He then releases the men, who promptly hang the witness father and attempt to kill the witness. The FBI evacuate the family to the north and realize they will receive no help at all from local authorities.Meanwhile, Anderson has developed a close relationship with the wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell who, in a tearful confession, reveals to Anderson that the three missing men have been murdered by her husband and his Klansmen accomplices, who then buried the bodies in an earthen dam. After the bodies are discovered, revealing to the nation that the disappearance of the civil rights workers was in fact murder, Pell beats his wife brutally in retribution after discovering her betrayal.Ward and Andersons different approaches spill over into a physical fight which Ward wins, but he concedes that his methods have been ineffective, and he gives Anderson carte blanche authorization to deal with the problem in his own way. Anderson devises a plan to indict members of the Klan for civil rights violations, instead of murder, because civil rights violations are federal crimes which means that convictions for civil rights violations are more certain compared to state-level charges of murder. The FBI arranges the kidnapping of Mayor Tilman, taking him to a remote shack, where he is left with a black man who threatens to castrate him unless he speaks out. Tilman gives him a complete description of the killings, including the names of those who were involved in it. The abductor is revealed to be an FBI operative who has been assigned to intimidate Tilman. Although the obtained information is inadmissible in court because it was obtained by coercion, it still proves to be valuable to the investigators.Anderson and Ward concoct a plan, luring identified Klan collaborators to a bogus meeting, but the men soon realize that they have been set up and they leave the bogus meeting without discussing the murders. The FBI then concentrates on Lester Cowens, a Klansman of interest who exhibits a nervous demeanor, which the agents believe might yield a confession. The Feds pick him up and interrogate him. Anderson stages a tussle with Pell at the local barbershop in retaliation for the attack on his wife and takes off. Later, Cowens is at home when a shotgun blast shatters his windows. After seeing a burning cross on his lawn, he attempts to flee in his truck but is caught by several hooded men who intend to hang him. The team arrives to rescue him, having staged the entire scene where the hooded men are revealed to be other FBI agents.Cowens, believing that his redneck brothers have threatened his life because of his admissions to the FBI, finally incriminates his accomplices. The Klansmen are charged with civil rights violations. Most of the perpetrators are convicted and are sentenced to 3\u201310 years imprisonment, while Sherriff Stuckey is acquitted. The FBI later finds Tilman has hanged himself, and Bird wonders why. Ward tells him Tilman was guilty, for being a witness. Mrs. Pell returns to her home, which has been completely ransacked by vandals. She resolves to stay and rebuild her life, free of her husband. Before they leave town, Anderson and Ward visit an integrated congregation, gathered at an African American cemetery, where the black civil rights activists desecrated gravestone reads, Not Forgotten.",

            "plot": "Michigan State University students Ash Williams and his girlfriend, Linda, take a romantic getaway to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in it, Ash plays a tape of archaeologist Raymond Knowby, the cabins previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Book of the Dead, Necronomicon ExMortis, which he uncovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an unseen evil force, known as the Kandarian Demon, that kills and possesses Linda, turning her into a deadite. Ash decapitates Linda with a shovel and buries her in a shallow grave near the cabin. At dawn, the evil force throws Ash through the woods. He briefly becomes possessed by the demon, but when day breaks, he is inexplicably returned to normal. He attempts to flee the area but finds that the bridge to the cabin has been destroyed. The entity chases him back to the cabin, where Lindas revived head bites his hand. He runs to the shed, where her headless body lunges at him with a chainsaw, but he overpowers and slashes the deadite Linda to death. His right hand becomes possessed and tries to kill him. Ash severs it with the chainsaw before attempting to shoot it with a shotgun, but the hand mocks him and ultimately escapes. Meanwhile, Knowbys daughter Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with the missing pages of the Necronomicon, only to stumble upon the destroyed bridge. They enlist repairman Jake and his girlfriend Bobby Joe to lead them in another route to the cabin. There, they find an embattled Ash covered in blood, who accidentally shoots Bobby Joe. Deducing that he murdered Annies parents, Annie and the others lock him in the cellar. The four new arrivals listen to the rest of Knowbys recording, detailing his wife Henriettas possession by the Kandarian Demon, and that he killed her before burying her in the cellar. Henrietta, now a deadite, possesses Ed, whom Ash dismembers with an axe. Bobby Joe attempts to escape through the woods when Ashs severed hand latches onto hers, but demonically possessed trees attack and drag her to her death. Annie translates two of the Necronomicons pages before Jake turns on them and throws the pages into the cellar, forcing them at gunpoint to locate Bobby Joe. Ash becomes possessed once more and attacks Jake. Annie retreats to the cabin and accidentally stabs Jake, mistaking him for the possessed Ash, before Henrietta kills him. Deadite Ash tries to kill Annie, but returns to his normal self upon seeing Lindas necklace. With Annies help, Ash modifies the chainsaw, attaches it to the stump of his right arm, and cuts the shotguns barrel. After finding the missing pages of the Necronomicon in the cellar, Ash kills Henrietta. The trees outside begin wrecking the cabin. Annie reveals she only read the first half of the incantation and attempts to finish the second half. As she reads it, Ashs severed hand uses a Kandarian dagger to stab her in the back. She manages to complete the incantation before succumbing to her wound. The incantation opens up a whirling temporal vortex which not only draws in the demon, but also Ash and his Oldsmobile Delta 88. Ash and his Oldsmobile land in the Middle Ages. A group of knights confront him and initially mistake him for a deadite, but are quickly distracted when a real harpylike deadite appears. Ash blasts it with his shotgun and they hail him as a hero who has come to save them. Realizing that he was the hero prophesied in the book, Ash breaks down and screams in anguish as they hail him.",

            "plot": "On a warm and sunny spring day in a Chicago suburb, high school senior Ferris Bueller fakes illness to stay home from school, regularly breaking the fourth wall. His parents, Katie and Tom, believe he is ill, though his sister, Jeanie, does not. After learning Ferris is absent from school for the ninth time that semester, the school\u2019s dean, Edward Rooney, becomes determined to expose Ferris\u2019s chronic truancy; Ferris has changed his attendance records by hacking into the school\u2019s computer system, making it appear as if he attends school regularly. Ferris persuades his hypochondriac best friend Cameron Frye to help excuse Ferris\u2019s girlfriend Sloane Peterson from school by claiming that her grandmother has died. Cameron calls the school, pretending to be Sloane\u2019s father. Knowing Sloane is dating Ferris, Rooney is suspicious. Ferris also calls the school during Cameron\u2019s phone call to confirm his absence, thereby fooling Rooney. To complete the ruse that Sloane\u2019s father is picking her up from school, Ferris borrows the prized possession of Cameron\u2019s father, a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder. Fearing his father\u2019s wrath, Cameron is dismayed when Ferris takes the car on a day trip into Chicago. Ferris promises they will return the car as it was, including preserving the original odometer mileage. Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane leave the car with two parking attendants, who promptly take it on a long joyride. The trio eat lunch at an upscale restaurant, visit the Art Institute of Chicago, go to a Chicago Cubs baseball game, and attend the Von Steuben Day Parade, where Ferris jumps on a float and lip syncs to \u201cDanke Schoen\u201d by Wayne Newton and \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d by The Beatles. Rooney prowls the Bueller home for Ferris, becoming victim to several pratfalls. Jeanie skips class and returns home to confront Ferris, but finds Rooney instead. Shocked by his appearance, she knocks him unconscious and calls the police. Rooney regains consciousness and leaves. The police arrest Jeanie, believing she prank called the police station. While detained, she meets another delinquent who advises her to worry less about Ferris\u2019s exploits and more about her own life. Upon collecting the Ferrari and heading home, Ferris and Cameron discover that the car\u2019s mileage has significantly increased. Cameron becomes semi-catatonic from shock, later almost drowning in a pool before a worried Ferris helps him. At Cameron\u2019s house, Ferris jacks up the car and runs it in reverse to rewind the odometer. However, this attempt fails and Cameron destroys the car out of anger toward his domineering father. Ferris offers to take the blame, but Cameron decides to tell the truth and stand up to his father. After walking Sloane home, Ferris remembers his parents will be returning soon. He runs through the neighborhood, but is nearly hit by Jeanie\u2019s car as Jeanie and Katie are driving home. Katie fails to notice Ferris, though Jeanie does. Ferris makes it home first, but Rooney confronts him before he can get back inside. Seeing the two through the window, Jeanie has a change of heart and allows Ferris to come inside, claiming that Ferris was at the hospital for his illness. She also shows Rooney his wallet that had fallen from his pocket in the kitchen earlier, tosses it into a nearby puddle, and shuts the back door loud enough to wake up the family\u2019s pet Rottweiler. As Rooney flees the house, Ferris rushes back to his bedroom to await his parents. They find him in bed and believe he has been at home all day. In a scene that plays during the credits, a humiliated, disheveled, and injured Rooney reluctantly accepts a ride on a school bus filled with students who act derisively toward him. He sits next to a girl who offers him a gummy bear from her pocket, which he tosses away in disgust. Rooney glances at another student\u2019s notebook (which has \u201cSAVE FERRIS\u201d written on the cover), before glaring at the camera as the school bus drives off. In a post-credits scene, Ferris looks into the camera and says, \u201cYou\u2019re still here? It\u2019s over! Go home! Go.\u201d",

            "plot": "On Saturday, March 24, 1984, five students at Shermer High School in Shermer, Illinois, report for an all-day detention: socially awkward Brian Johnson (Hall), jock Andrew Clark (Estevez), shy loner Allison Reynolds (Sheedy), popular girl Claire Standish (Ringwald), and rebellious delinquent John Bender (Nelson). They gather in the school library and meet with their vice principal Richard Vernon (Gleason), who warns them not to talk or move from their seats and assigns each of them the task of writing a thousand-word essay describing who you think you are. Bender ignores the rules and spends his time antagonizing the others and defying Vernon, who gives him eight additional weekends of detention. The students sneak off to retrieve Benders marijuana stash from his locker. When they see Vernon returning to the library, Bender deliberately gets caught to allow the others to sneak back in. Locked in a storage closet as punishment, Bender is berated by Vernon even further who tells him that he wants Bender to prove how tough he is and is offered a chance to punch Vernon but fails to act. He soon escapes into the ceiling panels and falls into the library, where the others hide him from Vernon. The students pass the time arguing, listening to music, and smoking marijuana, gradually opening up about their home lives and their reasons for being in detention: Claire\\'s popularity subjects her to intense peer pressure, while her bickering parents use her against each other. She received detention for skipping school to go shopping. Bender reveals the physical abuse he and his mother suffer at the hands of his father, including cigar burns, as well as other injuries he has sustained from his father physically abusing him. He is serving detention for pulling a false fire alarm. Andrew became influenced by jock culture and is intimidated by his father to succeed in wrestling. He was given detention for taping a students buttocks together in an attempt to win both his teammates and his fathers approval. Brian is under so much academic pressure from his parents to get good grades that he contemplated suicide after getting an F in shop class. He was sent to detention for bringing a flare gun to school. Allison is compulsively dishonest with neglectful parents, constantly stealing things to use should she ever run away from home. She admits that she showed up to detention for lack of anything better to do. Despite their differences, the students realize they all face similar problems; Andrew and Allison bond over their complex relationships with their parents; Brian and Claire each feel anxiety over being a virgin. Still, the group suspects that their new friendships will end once detention is over. Meanwhile, Vernon complains to the janitor, Carl, that students have become less disciplined and more arrogant compared to the ones he had when he was a teacher, but Carl suggests that Vernon is the one who has changed and cares too much about what the students think of him. The others convince Brian to complete Vernons essay on the groups behalf. Claire gives Allison a makeover, which sparks romantic interest from Andrew, and Bender crawls back to the closet, where Claire challenges her pristine reputation by kissing him. As the students part ways, Allison and Andrew kiss, and she rips the state championship patch off his letterman jacket to keep; Claire gives Bender one of her diamond earrings, and they share their own kiss. Vernon reads Brians essay, which asserts that the vice principal has made petty assumptions about all of them and declares that each one of us is a brain (Brian), an athlete (Andrew), a basket case (Allison), a princess (Claire), and a criminal (Bender). Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club. Finally, Bender walks home across the schools football field and raises his fist in the air triumphantly as he leaves.",

            "plot": "After Columbia University parapsychology professors Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler experience their first encounter with a ghost at the New York Public Library, the university dean dismisses the credibility of their paranormal-focused research and fires them. The trio responds by establishing Ghostbusters, a paranormal investigation and elimination service operating out of a disused firehouse. They develop high-tech nuclear-powered equipment to capture and contain ghosts, although business is initially slow. Following a paranormal encounter in her apartment, cellist Dana Barrett visits the Ghostbusters. She recounts witnessing a demonic dog-like creature in her refrigerator utter a single word: Zuul. Ray and Egon research Zuul and details of Danas building while Peter inspects her apartment and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her. The Ghostbusters are hired to remove a gluttonous ghost from the Sedgewick Hotel. Having failed to properly test their equipment, Egon warns the group that crossing the energy streams of their proton pack weapons could cause a catastrophic explosion. They capture the ghost and deposit it in an ecto-containment unit under the firehouse. Supernatural activity rapidly increases across the city and the Ghostbusters become famous; they hire a fourth member, Winston Zeddemore, to cope with the growing demand. Suspicious of the Ghostbusters, Environmental Protection Agency inspector Walter Peck asks to evaluate their equipment, but Peter rebuffs him. Egon warns that the containment unit is nearing capacity and supernatural energy is surging across the city. Peter meets with Dana and informs her Zuul was a demigod worshipped as a servant to Gozer the Gozerian, a shapeshifting god of destruction. Upon returning home, she is possessed by Zuul; a similar entity possesses her neighbor, Louis Tully. Peter arrives and finds the possessed DanaZuul claiming to be the Gatekeeper. Louis is brought to Egon by police officers and claims he is Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster. The Ghostbusters agree they must keep the pair separated. Peck returns with law enforcement and city workers to have the Ghostbusters arrested and their containment unit deactivated, causing an explosion that releases the captured ghosts. LouisVinz escapes in the confusion and makes his way to the apartment building to join DanaZuul. In jail, Ray and Egon reveal that Ivo Shandor, leader of a Gozer-worshipping cult in the early 20th century, designed Danas building to function as an antenna to attract and concentrate spiritual energy to summon Gozer and bring about the apocalypse. Faced with supernatural chaos across the city, the Ghostbusters convince the mayor to release them. The Ghostbusters travel to a hidden temple located on top of the building as DanaZuul and LouisVinz open the gate between dimensions and transform into demonic dogs. Gozer appears as a woman and attacks the Ghostbusters, then disappears when they attempt to retaliate. Her disembodied voice demands the Ghostbusters choose the form of the destructor. Ray inadvertently recalls a beloved corporate mascot from his childhood, and Gozer reappears as a gigantic Stay Puft Marshmallow Man that begins destroying the city. Against his earlier advice, Egon instructs the team to cross their proton energy streams at the dimensional gate. The resulting explosion destroys Gozers avatar, banishing it back to its dimension, and closes the gateway. The Ghostbusters rescue Dana and Louis from the wreckage and are welcomed on the street as heroes.",

            "plot": "A race of diminutive aliens visit Earth at night to gather plant specimens in a California forest. One alien, fascinated by the distant lights of a San Fernando Valley neighborhood, separates from the group, before U.S. government agents arrive and chase the startled creature. The aliens are forced to depart before the agents can find them, leaving their lone member behind. While the agents search the forest, the creature takes shelter in a shed belonging to the family of ten-year-old Elliott Taylor. Initially scared by the creature, who runs away, Elliott spends the following day leaving a trail of Reese\\'s Pieces to lure it back to his home, where he hides it in his room. The following morning, Elliott feigns illness to stay off school and play with the creature, whom he dubs E.T. Elliott eventually introduces E.T. to his older brother, Michael, and seven-year-old sister Gertie, who agree to keep him hidden from their hardworking, single mother, Mary. When the children ask about his origins, E.T. displays telekinetic abilities by levitating several balls to represent his planetary system, and later demonstrates other extraordinary abilities by reviving a dead chrysanthemum and instantly healing a cut on Elliott\\'s finger. As Elliott bonds with the creature, he begins to feel E.T.\\'s thoughts and emotions, being startled simultaneously with E.T. when the creature accidentally opens an umbrella in a different room. At school, Elliott becomes intoxicated because, at home, E.T. is drinking beer and watching television. Sensing E.T.\\'s desire to be rescued, Elliott impulsively frees the frogs about to be vivisected in his biology class, inspiring the other children to follow his lead, and romantically kisses a girl he likes because E.T. is watching John Wayne kiss Maureen O\\'Hara in The Quiet Man 1952; Elliott is sent to the principal\\'s office for his disruptive behavior. Inspired by a Buck Rogers comic strip, depicting the character calling for help with a communication device, E.T. is inspired to build a makeshift device to phone home, using various parts around the Taylor home. E.T. also learns to speak English, and requests the children\\'s help to build the device. They agree to help find the missing components, unaware that the agents have become suspicious they are harboring the alien. On Halloween, the children disguise E.T. as a ghost and Elliott sneaks it to the forest, where they set up the device to call its people. Elliott begs E.T. to stay on Earth with him, before falling asleep and waking alone in the forest the following morning. He returns home to his worried family, while Michael searches for E.T., finding him pale and weakened by a culvert. He takes E.T. home, where Elliott is also growing weaker, and reveal the creature to Mary just before government agents invade and quarantine the house. The lead agent, Keys, asks for Elliott\\'s help to save E.T., stating that meeting aliens was his childhood dream and he considers E.T\\'s arrival a genuine miracle. However, E.T. dies while Elliott rapidly recovers. Left alone to say goodbye, Elliott tells E.T. that he loves him, but E.T.\\'s heart begins to glow and he is revived and restored to health. E.T. tells Elliott that its people are returning for him. Elliott and Michael flee with E.T. on their bikes, flanked by Michael\\'s friends who help them evade the pursuing authorities. Heading towards a roadblock, E.T. levitates the boys to safety and lands them in the forest. E.T.\\'s ship arrives, and he says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, who gifts him the chrysanthemum he previously revived. Elliott tearfully asks E.T. to stay, but E.T. places his glowing finger on Elliott\\'s head and tells him that he will always be there. The children, Mary, and Keys observe as the ship blasts off into space, leaving a rainbow in the sky.",

            "plot": "Ted Kramer, a workaholic advertising executive in New York City, has just landed an important account and job promotion. However, when he shares the news with Joanna, his wife of eight years, she shocks him by announcing she is leaving him. She walks out of the apartment without Billy, the couple\\'s seven-year-old son, because she feels she is unfit to be a mother. The next morning when Billy asks about his mother, Ted explains that she went away to be alone for a while. Ted drops Billy at his elementary school by asking him what grade he attends and leaving him with a woman at the entrance, before rushing to work. At the ad agency, Ted confides about the situation to Jim O\\'Connor, his boss and friend. Jim is understanding, but hopes that Ted\\'s situation will not interfere with his new responsibility as the lead person on the Mid-Atlantic Airlines account. Initially, Ted and Billy struggle to adapt to their new living situation as Billy misses his mother and Ted has to do the extra housework usually done by Joanna. Father and son gradually settle into a routine without Joanna, but Ted\u2019s work suffers. Billy and Ted have a fight one evening in which Billy cries for his mother, but they later reconcile. When Billy worries his mother\u2019s departure is his fault, Ted assures him that Joanna left because she was not happy in the marriage. Meanwhile, Ted has become good friends with divorced neighbor Margaret Phelps, whom Joanna was confidantes with. One day, Billy has an accident when he falls off a jungle gym. Ted rushes him to the hospital, and asks the doctor to let him stay by his son\\'s side as he receives ten stitches. After fifteen months, Ted receives a call from Joanna and meets her at a restaurant. Joanna reveals she is happier after working in California and seeing a therapist. When she states that she is now ready to raise her son and wants Billy to come live with her, Ted becomes furious and leaves. He consults with a divorce attorney John Shaunessy, who cautions that the court usually awards custody to the mother when the child is young. At work, Jim notifies Ted the agency is letting him go because the Mid-Atlantic Airlines executives are displeased with his work. Knowing he has no chance at custody if he is unemployed, Ted doggedly tries to land a job within twenty-four hours, despite few ad firms hiring during the holiday season. He convinces two agency executives to consider his application immediately, and accepts a lower-salaried position for which he is overqualified. The custody hearing begins. In court, Joanna asserts that Ted never abused her or was unfaithful, but she lost her self-esteem as a stay-at-home mother. She insists she has since \"become a whole person again\" and believes her son needs her more than his father. Ted states he has proven that he can parent as well as Joanna, and insists that taking Billy away from him could cause \"irreparable\" harm. The legal battle becomes contentious when the attorneys resort to brutal character assassinations. Shaunessy brings Joanna to tears by forcing her to admit that she was part of the marriage\\'s failure. Ted also admits he made mistakes as a father and husband. However, his job loss and Billy\\'s accident are used to discredit him. Ted expresses resentment at Joanna for her attorney\\'s aggressive tactics. Margaret testifies on behalf of Ted and implores Joanna to recognize that he has become a great father. Later, Ted learns Joanna was awarded custody. He decides not to appeal in order to spare Billy the burden of testifying in court. Billy becomes upset as Ted explains that they will still see each other, even though Billy will be living with his mother. On the morning Joanna is scheduled to pick up Billy, she rings the apartment building\\'s intercom and asks to see Ted in the lobby alone. She tearfully reveals that she is relinquishing custody after realizing that she does not want to take Billy away from his home. Ted reassures her as she takes the elevator up to inform her son.",

            "plot": "In 1916, Chicago steelworker Bill accidentally kills his factory foreman during an argument. He flees to the Texas Panhandle with his girlfriend Abby and his young sister Linda. As their train winds its way across the country, an older Linda mulls over these events in voiceover narration. She remembers that a religious man once warned her of a vision of apocalyptic hellfire, and notes that at the Last Judgment, God will rescue the good and turn away the evil.In Texas, a wealthy farmer suffering from an unspecified malady hires as many seasonal shockers as he can find, including Bill and Abby, who pretend to be siblings to deter gossip. The farmer and his aging foreman work the shockers hard, and turn a profit of over 100000 about 3 million in 2024 dollars. Bill envies the farmers wealth; as Linda remarks, workers in Chicago often live in poverty. Bill overhears a doctor telling the farmer that he has one year left to live. The farmers accountant encourages him to sell his farm and enjoy his profits, but the farmer recklessly insists on staying.The dying farmer takes a liking to the beautiful Abby, and asks her to stay with him after the harvest. Bill encourages Abby to marry the farmer so that they can inherit his money when he dies. Abby reminds Bill that she is in love with him, not the farmer, and questions whether Bill still loves her. Bill confidently predicts that the farmer will die soon and they will be reunited. Despite the questionable ethics of his proposal, he rationalizes that when he and Abby are rich, whos gonna care that we acted perfectAbby marries the farmer. She persuades him to let Bill and Linda stay at the farmhouse. The foreman suspects that Abby and Bill are con artists, but the farmer dismisses the suggestion and distances himself from the foreman.Surprisingly, the farmers health remains stable, foiling Bills plans. Over time, the shy farmer wins over Abby with his genuine disposition. However, he grows suspicious of Abbys excessively familiar relationship with her brother. Bill belatedly realizes that Abby has fallen in love with the farmer. He realizes that the only way to salvage the situation is to leave the farm, leaving his little sister with his ex-girlfriend. The farmer coldly watches him go. With Bill gone, the situation becomes less tense. The farmer tries to be a good father figure to Linda. In voiceover, the present-day Linda wonders whether the devil ruined Bills plans to punish his greed.Bill courts disaster by returning to the farm during the following years harvest. He admits to Abby that encouraging her to marry another man was a mistake and that he is to blame. His timing is poor, as a locust swarmreminiscent of a Biblical plague soon arrives, threatening to destroy the entire harvest. The farmer lights controlled fires to try to smoke out the locusts. However, when he sees Bill, he loses control of himself and furiously chases after Bill with a gun. The farmer knocks over one of his fire lamps in the process, triggering a widespread blaze that destroys much of the harvest. Bill kills the farmer with a screwdriver.Once again, Bill, Abby, and Linda are on the run, leaving them no better off than they were the year before. With the foremans help, the police find the group and shoot Bill as he tries to escape. Seeking a new life, Abby leaves Linda at a boarding school and departs on a train with soldiers headed for World War I.In the final scene, Linda runs away from school with a friend from the farm, with no real idea of what to do next. The present-day Linda continues narrating as the screen fades out, implying that her story will continue, but this part of her life is now over",

            "plot": "During the American Civil War, the wife and son of Missouri farmer Josey Wales are murdered by pro-Union paramilitaries led by the brutal Captain Terrill. After burying their corpses, Wales seeks vengeance for his family by joining a group of Confederate bushwhackers under the command of William T. Anderson, attacking the Union Army and pro-Union sympathizers. After the war ends in 1865, Wales superior Captain Fletcher persuades his men to surrender, having been promised amnesty by Union General Jim Lane. However, Terrills men massacre the bushwhackers after they surrender, with Wales, Fletcher and fellow bushwhacker Jamie being the only survivors. Wales and Jamie flee, and Lane forces Fletcher to assist Terrill in hunting them down. A mortally wounded Jamie helps Wales kill two bounty hunters before dying. With a 5000 bounty on his head, Wales flees to Texas. He meets elderly Cherokee man Lone Watie on the way, who informs Wales that Confederate General Joseph O. Shelby is fleeing to Mexico and suggests they do likewise. Wales subsequently rescues young Navajo woman Little Moonlight and kills another bounty hunter. Alongside Little Moonlight, Wales also rescues an elderly Kansan woman Sarah Turner and her granddaughter Laura Lee from marauding Comancheros. At the town of Santo Rio, two employees of Turners dead son Tom, Travis and Chato, also join the group. Wales and his companions find Toms abandoned ranch and settle down there. Discovering that Travis and Chato have been kidnapped by Comanche chief Ten Bears, Wales rides into his camp and negotiates the return of the two men; an impressed Ten Bears becomes blood brothers with Wales. A bounty hunter whose partner was killed by Wales at Santo Rio guides Terrill and his men to the town. On the following morning, Terrils men launch a surprise attack on the ranch, but Waless companions manage to gun them all down. A wounded and ammunitionless Wales follows the fleeing Terrill back to Santo Rio, where he corners him. A wounded Terrill attempts to draw his sabre but Wales grabs his hand and forces the blade through Terrils chest, killing him. Returning to the town saloon, Wales discovers its patrons telling Fletcher, accompanied by two Texas Rangers, that an outlaw named Josey Wales was recently killed in Monterrey by five gunmen. The Rangers accept the story and leave, while Fletcher pretends not to recognize Wales and tells him he will go to Mexico himself to look for Wales and tell him the war is over. Wales responds by stating that I reckon so. I guess we all died a little in that damned war before riding off into the sunset.",

            "plot": "Harry Caul, a surveillance expert in San Francisco, specializes in wiretapping services. He and his team are hired by a client, who identifies himself as the Director, to eavesdrop on a couple walking through Union Square. Despite the background noise, Caul filters and merges the tapes to create a clear recording with ambiguous meaning. Caul is intensely private, obsessively guarding his own personal life, haunted by guilt from a past job that resulted in three deaths. Despite Caul\\'s insistence that he is not responsible for how his clients use the surveillance, he is troubled by guilt and his Catholic faith. When he discovers a potentially dangerous phrase in the recording, He\\'d kill us if he got the chance, Caul becomes increasingly paranoid. His attempt to deliver the recording is thwarted, and he believes he is being followed and tricked. After a party at his workshop, Caul spends the night with a woman, Meredith, and the tapes are stolen. He receives a call from Martin Stett, the Director\\'s assistant, informing him that they have the tapes, and that the Director couldn\\'t wait any longer, so Caul must also deliver the pictures taken, and collect his money in a meeting with them, that same day. In that meeting, Caul learns that the woman in the recording is the Director\\'s wife, involved in an affair. Caul, suspecting murder, books a hotel room next to the one mentioned in the recording, and overhears a heated argument. Convinced he has overheard a murder, Caul breaks into the room; he initially finds no evidence, until he flushes the toilet and finds it clogged and overflowing with blood. Attempting to confront the Director, Caul discovers the wife is alive and unharmed, as is her lover. A newspaper headline reveals an executive\\'s supposed death in a car accident, leading Caul to realize that the couple actually murdered the Director. He missed the emphasis on us in the recording, not only signifying the couple\\'s fear of being killed by the Director if he discovered the affair, but also their own plan to murder him first. Stett calls Caul at his apartment, and warns him not to investigate, playing a recording of Caul\\'s saxophone to prove they are listening. Caul frantically searches for bugs in his apartment, destroying nearly everything in it. In the end, Caul sits alone amid the wreckage, playing his saxophone.",

            "plot": "Charlie Bucket, a poor paperboy, passes Willy Wonkas chocolate factory, where a tinker tells him that nobody ever enters or leaves the building. Charlies Grandpa Joe reveals that Wonka had shut down the factory due to espionage from rival confectioners; production resumed three years later, but the factory remained closed to the public and the new workers are unknown. Wonka announces that he has hidden five Golden Tickets in Wonka Bars; the finders of the tickets will receive a tour of the factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate. The first four tickets are found by gluttonous Augustus Gloop, spoiled Veruca Salt, gum-chewer Violet Beauregarde, and television-obsessed Mike Teevee. A mysterious man is seen whispering to each winner. On the day before the factory tour, Charlie finds money in a gutter and uses it to buy a Wonka Bar that contains the fifth ticket. On his way home, he encounters the man who spoke to the other winners. Introducing himself as Arthur Slugworth, one of Wonkas competitors, the man offers Charlie a large monetary reward in exchange for a sample of Wonkas new invention, the Everlasting Gobstopper. Arriving home with the Golden Ticket, Charlie chooses Grandpa Joe as his chaperone. The next day, Wonka greets the children at the front gates of the factory and leads them inside, where they are made to sign a contract. The tour begins in the Chocolate Room, where the visitors meet Wonkas workforce: little people known as OompaLoompas. The children receive Everlasting Gobstoppers in the Inventing Room. One by one, each child is expelled from the tour except for Charlie: Augustus is sucked up a pipe after falling into the Chocolate River, Violet chews an experimental gum and swells into a giant human blueberry, Veruca falls down a garbage chute in the Egg Room, and Mike is shrunk to the size of a chocolate bar after misusing the Wonkavision teleporter. At one point, Charlie and Grandpa Joe sample Fizzy Lifting Drinks, causing them to float dangerously close to a fan; they descend safely by burping. When the tour is over, Wonka refuses to give Charlie and Grandpa Joe their chocolate prize on the grounds that they violated the contract by taking the Fizzy Lifting Drinks. Grandpa Joe plans to give the Gobstopper to Slugworth out of spite, but Charlie chooses to return it instead. Wonka declares Charlie the winner of the contest, revealing that Slugworth is actually one of his employees, and that the offer to buy the Gobstopper from the kids was a test of character. As the three fly over the town in the Wonkavator, a multi-directional glass elevator, Wonka explains that he created the contest to find a worthy successor and invites Charlie and his family to come and live in the factory.",

Initially unsuccessful, he finally beds a middle-aged woman, Cass, in her Park Avenue apartment. She is insulted when he requests payment, and Joe ultimately gives money to her.Joe meets Rico Ratso Rizzo, an indigent con man with a limp who takes 20 for introducing him to a pimp. After discovering that the alleged pimp is actually an unhinged religious fanatic, Joe flees and unsuccessfully searches for Rico. Joe spends his days wandering the city, listening to his Zenith portable radio and sitting in his hotel room. When his money runs out, management locks Joe out and impounds his belongings.In an attempt to make money, Joe receives oral sex from a meek young man in a movie theater, but the man cannot pay. Joe threatens him, but releases him unharmed. The next day, Joe spots Rico at a diner, and angrily confronts him. Rico manages to calm Joe, and invites him to share his squalid, condemned apartment squat. Joe reluctantly accepts, and the two begin a business relationship as hustlers. Rico asks Joe to call him Rico instead of Ratso, but Joe does not oblige. They struggle with severe poverty, stealing food and failing to get work for Joe. Joe pawns his radio and sells his blood, while Ricos persistent cough worsens during a winter without heat in the freezing apartment.In intermittent flashbacks, Joes grandmother raises him after his mother abandons him. He has a tragic relationship with Annie, disclosed through hazy flashbacks in which they are attacked and raped by a cowboy gang. Annie shows signs of mental trauma and is taken into an ambulance.Rico tells Joe his father was an illiterate Italian immigrant shoeshiner whose job yielded a bad back and lung damage from inhaling shoe polish. Rico learned shoeshining from his father, but considers it degrading and generally refuses to do it. When he breaks into a stand and shines Joes cowboy boots to attract clients, two police officers arrive and sit with their dirty boots next to Joes. Rico dreams of escaping to Miami, shown in fantasies in which he and Joe frolic on a beach and are pampered at a resort, including a boy polishing Ricos boots.A Warhol-like filmmaker and an extrovert female artist approach Joe in a diner, taking his photograph and inviting him to a Warhol-esque art event. Joe and Rico attend, but Ricos poor health and hygiene attract unwanted attention. After mistaking a joint for a cigarette and receiving uppers, Joe hallucinates. He leaves with Shirley, a socialite who pays him 20 for spending the night, but Joe cannot perform sexually. They play Scribbage, and the resulting wordplay leads Shirley to suggest that Joe may be gay; suddenly, he is able to perform. The next morning, she sets up her female friend as Joes client, and at last his career appears to be progressing.When Joe returns to the apartment, Rico is severely feverish. He refuses medical help, and begs Joe to put him on a bus to Florida. Desperate for cash, Joe picks up an effeminate middle-aged man in an arcade. The two return to the mans hotel room, where Joe demands money. However, when the man refuses to give him more than 10, Joe brutally beats, robs, and apparently smothers him. Joe buys two bus tickets to Florida with the stolen cash. Rico again tells Joe that he wants to be called Rico, not Ratso, and Joe finally begins to oblige. During the bus trip, Ricos health worsens, and he suffers from urinary incontinence.Joe buys new clothing for Rico and himself at a rest stop, discarding his cowboy outfit and boots. Back on the bus, Joe muses that there must be an easier way to make money than hustling, and tells Rico that he will get a regular job in Miami. When he does not respond, Joe realizes that Rico has died. Joe alerts the bus driver, who asks Joe to close Ricos eyelids, saying that they will soon be in Miami. The other passengers stare. With tears in his eyes, Joe sits with his arm around his dead friend as the bus continues past rows of Floridian palm trees.",

The couple became engaged after a 10-day romance. Joannas parents are Matt Drayton, a newspaper editor, and his wife, Christina, who owns an art gallery. Though the Draytons are liberal-minded, they are shocked that their daughter is engaged to a man of a different race. Christina gradually accepts the situation, but Matt objects because of the likely unhappiness and seemingly insurmountable problems the couple will face. Unbeknownst to Joanna, John tells the Drayton parents he will withdraw from the engagement unless both Draytons give the couple their blessing. To complicate matters, John is soon scheduled to Geneva, Switzerland, for three months in his work with the World Health Organization. His answer from the Draytons will determine whether Joanna follows him. Joanna invites Johns parents to fly up from Los Angeles to join them for dinner that evening. John has not told them his fianc\u00e9e is white. Monsignor Mike Ryan, Matts golf buddy, arrives and tells Matt and the couple that he is supportive of the engagement. Christina tells Matt she, too, is supportive of Joanna, even if it means fighting Matt. Christina fires her bigoted art gallery manager, Hilary St. George, who nosily intrudes and voices her sympathy for Christinas situation. Johns parents, the Prentices, arrive and are shocked to discover that Joanna is white. The two mothers agree that this was an unexpected event but support their children. The two fathers meet, expressing disapproval at this unhappy occasion. The Monsignor advises John not to withdraw, despite Matts objections. John and his father discuss their generational differences. Johns mother tells Matt that he and her husband have forgotten what it was like to fall in love, and their failure to remember true romance has clouded their thinking. John chides Matt for not having the guts to tell him he disapproved of the marriage. Finally, Matt reveals his decision about the engagement to the entire group. He concludes that he does remember what true romance is. He says although the pair face enormous problems, they must find a way to overcome them, and he will approve the marriage, knowing all along he had no right to stop it. The families and the Monsignor then adjourn to the dining room for dinner.",

She is thrilled to learn he is already on his way and feels they are linked by a kind of telepathy. The Newtons are delighted at Uncle Charlies company. He has extravagant gifts for everyone: a watch for his brotherinlaw, a fur for his sister, and an emerald ring for his niece. Young Charlie notices the ring is engraved with someone elses initials. Uncle Charlie explains the jeweler must have rooked him.Two men soon appear at the Newton home pretending to survey middle class homes. They go to great lengths to take Uncle Charlies picture. Young Charlie guesses they are undercover detectives. They explain her uncle is one of two suspects in a nationwide manhunt. Charlie refuses to believe it at first, but learns that the initials engraved inside her emerald ring match one of the victims of the Merry Widow Murderer. She eyes her uncle with growing suspicion and dread.During one dinner, Uncle Charlie lets his guard down and rants about rich widows, describing them as fat, wheezing animals. Horrified, young Charlie runs out of the room. Uncle Charlie follows her and takes her into a seedy bar. He admits he is one of the two murder suspects and begs for help. She reluctantly agrees not to say anything. She is desperate to avoid a disgrace that would destroy her mother, who adores her younger brother.News breaks that the other Merry Widow suspect was chased by police and killed.

            "plot": "After visiting the fictional country of Bandrika, English tourist Iris Henderson is returning home to get married, but an avalanche blocks the railway line. The stranded passengers are forced to spend the night at a hotel. In the same predicament are Charters and Caldicott, cricket enthusiasts anxious to see the last days of a Test match in Manchester, and Miss Froy, a governess and music teacher. Miss Froy listens to a folk singer in the street, but he is strangled to death by an unseen murderer. That evening, Iris is bothered by a loud noise from the room above hers. It is caused by Gilbert Redman, an ethnomusicologist who plays the clarinet for local folk dancers. She attempts to get him removed from the room, but fails after he confronts her. The next morning at the railway station, Iris is attempting to return Miss Froys glasses when she is hit on the head by a large planter dropped from above. Miss Froy helps her onto the train. Also on board are Charters and Caldicott, Gilbert, lawyer Eric Todhunter and his mistress, who is passing herself off as Mrs. Todhunter. Iris faints and then comes to in a compartment with Miss Froy and several strangers. She joins Miss Froy in the dining car for tea. Soon after, they return to their compartment, where Iris falls asleep. When Iris wakes up, Miss Froy has vanished, and the other passengers in the compartment and some of the train staff deny having seen her. Todhunter pretends not to remember her to avoid drawing attention to his liaison with his mistress. Iris searches for Miss Froy with Gilberts assistance. Brain surgeon Dr. Hartz says Iris may be suffering from concussion-related hallucinations. Fearing that any delay would make them miss the cricket match, Charters and Caldicott also claim not to remember Miss Froy. Angry at her lover for his reluctance to pursue a divorce, Todhunters mistress admits to seeing Miss Froy. At the first stop, Dr. Hartzs patient, whose head is completely covered in bandages, is brought aboard on a stretcher and accompanied by an apparently deaf-mute nun. A woman dressed exactly like Miss Froy, Madame Kummer, appears in her place and claims to have helped Iris after she was struck on the head. Now concerned about potential scandal, Todhunters mistress says Madame Kummer was the woman she saw. Waiting in the corridor while one of the cooks tosses trash out the window, Gilbert sees a wrapper from Miss Froys personal tea package, which briefly sticks to a window, convincing him of her existence. While continuing their search, Iris and Gilbert find Miss Froys glasses in the baggage car. However, they are attacked by magician Signor Doppo who was in Iriss compartment. They lose the glasses in the struggle and Doppo escapes. Iris notices that the nun accompanying Dr. Hartzs patient is wearing high heels, and they suspect that patient has been replaced by Miss Froy. Dr. Hartz shares a drink with them in the dining car and takes them back to a compartment, where he admits that he is involved in the conspiracy and tells them they have been drugged. However the false nun, revealed to be a British woman in costume, did not put the drug into their drinks out of loyalty to her fellow countrymen. Gilbert and Iris escape, free Miss Froy and replace her with Madame Kummer. When the train stops near the border, Dr. Hartz discovers the switch. He has part of the train diverted onto a branch line, where soldiers wait. Gilbert and Iris inform their fellow passengers what is happening. A uniformed soldier boards and requests that they all accompany him. They knock him out and take his pistol. Another soldier fires, wounding Charters in the hand. During the ensuing gunfight, Miss Froy tells Gilbert and Iris that she must get away as she is actually a spy. Just in case, she gives them a message encoded in a tune to deliver to the Foreign Office in Whitehallthe same tune that the murdered street musician performed for her. Miss Froy then runs into the forest, and those on the train are not sure whether or not she is shot. Todhunter attempts to surrender, waving a white handkerchief, and is shot dead. Gilbert and Caldicott commandeer the locomotive, but the knocked out soldier wakes up and threatens the rest of the guests. The false nun escapes through a side door and switches the tracks but is shot in the leg; however, Caldicott and Gilbert manage to pull her up into the train before she is left behind. In London, Charters and Caldicott discover the Test Match has been cancelled due to flooding. Seeing her fianc\u00e9 from a distance, Iris jumps into a cab with Gilbert, who kisses her. They arrive at the Foreign Office, but in the waiting room Gilbert realizes he cannot remember the vital tune. As they are led into the office, Gilbert and Iris hear it. The doors open, revealing Miss Froy playing the tune on a piano.",

            "plot": "David Huxley is a mild-mannered paleontologist. For the past four years, he has been assembling the skeleton of a Brontosaurus but is missing one bone: the intercostal clavicle.  Adding to his stress is his impending marriage to Alice Swallow and the need to impress Elizabeth Random, who is considering a million-dollar donation to his museum.The day before his wedding, David meets Susan Vance by chance on a golf course. She plays his ball, but she is oblivious to the fact that she has made a mistake. Susan is a free-spirited, somewhat scatterbrained, young lady, unfettered by logic. These qualities soon embroil David in several frustrating incidents.Susan\\'s brother Mark has sent her a tame leopard named Baby from Brazil. Its tameness is helped by hearing the song I Can\\'t Give You Anything but Love, Baby. Susan thinks David is a zoologist, and manipulates him into accompanying her in taking Baby to her farm in Connecticut. Complications arise when Susan falls in love with him, and she tries to keep him at her house as long as possible, even hiding his clothes, to prevent his imminent marriage.David\\'s prized intercostal clavicle is delivered, but Susan\\'s aunt\\'s dog George takes it and buries it somewhere. When Susan\\'s aunt arrives, she discovers David in a negligee. To David\\'s dismay, she turns out to be Elizabeth Random. A second message from Mark makes clear the leopard is for Elizabeth, as she always wanted one. Baby and George, who have befriended one another, run off. The zoo is called to help capture Baby. Susan and David race to find Baby before the zookeepers do and, mistaking a dangerous leopard from a nearby circus for Baby, they let it out of its cage.David and Susan are jailed by a befuddled town policeman, Constable Slocum, for acting strangely at the house of Dr Fritz Lehman, where they have cornered the circus leopard, thinking it is Baby. When Slocum does not believe their story, Susan tells him they are members of the Leopard Gang; she calls herself Swingin\\' Door Susie, and David Jerry the Nipper. Eventually, when everyone\\'s identity has been cleared up, Susan who earlier escaped out a window returns, dragging a leopard on a rope. When it is revealed that this is not Baby but the highly irritated circus leopard, David saves Susan, using a chair to shoo the big cat into a cell.Some time later, Susan finds David, who has been jilted by Alice because of her, on a high platform working on his Brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum. After showing him the missing bone which she found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur to be closer to him. She tells David that her aunt has given her the million dollars, and she wants to donate it to the museum, but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent with her was the best day of his life. They declare their love for each other, and Susan, distracted by the moment, unconsciously swings the ladder from side to side. As they talk, and the ladder sways more and more with each swing, Susan and David finally notice that Susan is in danger. Frightened, she climbs onto the skeleton, eventually causing it to collapse. David grabs her hand before she falls, lifts her onto the platform, and halfheartedly complains about the loss of his years of work on his Brontosaurus as she talks him into forgiving her. Resigning himself to a future of chaos, David embraces and kisses Susan.",

            "plot": "In a castle on a stormy night, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron praise Mary Shelley for her story of Frankenstein and his Monster. She reminds them that her intention for writing the novel was to impart a moral lesson, the consequences of a mortal man who tries to play God. Mary says she has more of the story to tell. The scene shifts to the close of the 1931 movie Frankenstein, where villagers gathered around the burning windmill cheer the apparent death of the Monster. Hans, the father of a girl the creature drowned, wants to see the Monsters bones. He falls into a flooded pit underneath the mill, where the Monster\u2014having survived the fire\u2014strangles him. Hauling himself from the pit, the Monster casts Hans wife to her death. He next encounters Frankensteins servant Minnie, who flees in terror. The body of Victor FrankensteinHenry Frankenstein, who is thought to have died at the windmill, is returned to his fianc\u00e9e Elizabeth at his castle home. Minnie arrives to sound the alarm about the Monster, but her warning goes unheeded. Elizabeth, seeing Henry move, realizes he is still alive. Nursed back to health by Elizabeth, Henry has renounced his creation, but still believes he may be destined to unlock the secret of life and immortality. A hysterical Elizabeth cries that she foresees death. Henry visits the lab of his former mentor Doctor Septimus Pretorius, where Pretorius shows Henry several homunculi he has created. Pretorius wishes to work with Henry to create a mate for the Monster, with the proposed venture involving Pretorius growing an artificial brain while Henry gathers parts for the mate. The Monster saves a young shepherdess from drowning. Her screams upon seeing the Monster alert two hunters, who shoot and injure him. The hunters raise a mob that sets out in pursuit. Captured and trussed to a pole, the Monster is hauled to a dungeon and chained. Left alone, he breaks his chains, overpowers the guards, and escapes into the woods. That night, the Monster encounters an old blind hermit who thanks God for sending him a friend. He teaches the monster words like friend and good and shares a meal with him. Two lost hunters stumble upon the cottage and recognize the Monster. He attacks them and accidentally burns down the cottage as the hunters lead the hermit away. Taking refuge from another angry mob in a crypt, the Monster spies Pretorius and his cronies Karl and Ludwig breaking open a grave. The henchmen depart as Pretorius has supper. The Monster reveals himself, eats some of the food, and learns that Pretorius plans to create a mate for him. Henry and Elizabeth, now married, are visited by Pretorius. Henry expresses his refusal to assist Pretorius, who calls the Monster. The Monster demands Henrys help, to no avail. Pretorius orders the Monster out, secretly signaling him to kidnap Elizabeth. Pretorius guarantees her safe return upon Henrys participation. Henry returns to his tower laboratory and, despite himself, grows excited over his work. After being assured of Elizabeths safety, Henry completes the Brides body. A storm rages as final preparations are made to bring the Bride to life. Her bandagewrapped body is raised through the roof, where electricity is harnessed from lightning to animate her. Henry and Pretorius lower her and, after realizing their success in bringing her to life, remove her bandages and help her to stand. The Monster comes down the steps after killing Karl on the rooftop and sees his mate. The Monster reaches out to her and asks: Friend? The Bride, screaming, rejects him. He observes: She hate me Like others. As Elizabeth races to Henrys side, the Monster rampages through the lab. Before destroying everything, the Monster pauses and tells Henry and Elizabeth: Go You live Go To Pretorius and the Bride, he says: You stay We belong dead. While Henry and Elizabeth flee, the Bride hisses at the Monster. Shedding a tear, the Monster pulls a lever to trigger the laboratory and towers destruction.",

            "plot": "After fighting organized crime as Deadpool for two years, Wade Wilson fails to kill one of his targets on his anniversary with his girlfriend, Vanessa. That night, after the pair decides to start a family together, the target tracks Wade down and inadvertently kills Vanessa; Wade then kills him in revenge. Six weeks later, Wade is still wallowing in self-hatred. He visits Blind Al, where she unsuccessfully attempts to convince him to move on with his life. After a series of failed attempts to commit suicide, Wade has a vision of Vanessa in the afterlife but remains alive due to his healing abilities. Wade is left with only a SkeeBall token and an anniversary gift, as final mementos of Vanessa. Colossus recovers Wade\\'s body and takes him to the XMansion to recruit him. Wade reluctantly agrees to join the XMen because he believes Vanessa would have wanted him to. He, Colossus, and Negasonic Teenage Warhead respond to a standoff between authorities and the unstable young mutant Russell Collins at an orphanage owned by the Essex Corporation, labeled a Mutant Reeducation Center. Realizing that Russell has been abused by the orphanage staff, Wade kills one of the staff members before being restrained by Colossus, and both Wade and Russell are arrested. Fitted with power-suppressing collars, they are taken to the Ice Box, an isolated prison for mutant criminals. Meanwhile, Cable, a cybernetically enhanced soldier from the future, travels back in time to kill Russell. Cable storms the Ice Box and attacks Russell. Wade, whose collar breaks in the ensuing melee, attempts to protect Russell. After Cable takes Vanessa\\'s token, Wade forces himself and Cable out of the prison, but not before Russell overhears Wade denying that he cares for the lad. Near death again, Wade has another vision of Vanessa in which she convinces him to help Russell. Deadpool organizes a team he calls XForce to free Russell from a prison transfer convoy and protect him from Cable. The team launches its assault on the convoy by parachute, but all members die during the landing except for Wade and Domino, whose main superpower she claims to be pure luck. While a fight with Cable distracts them, Russell frees fellow inmate Juggernaut, who agrees to help him kill the abusive orphanage headmaster. Juggernaut destroys the convoy, rips Wade in half, and escapes alongside Russell. While Wade recovers, Cable offers to work with him and Domino to stop Russell from killing the headmaster. Cable explains that in his timeline, after Russell kills the headmaster, he becomes a serial killer who slaughters Cable\\'s family. Wade accepts Cable\\'s offer, on the condition that Cable gives him a chance to change Russell\\'s mind. At the orphanage, however, Deadpool and team are overpowered by Juggernaut, while Russell pursues the headmaster. Colossus, having initially refused to help out, due to Wade\\'s murderous ways, arrives to distract Juggernaut. Wade fails to placate Russell, forcing Cable to shoot at the boy. Wade leaps in front of the bullet while wearing the Ice Box collar and dies, reuniting with Vanessa in the afterlife. His sacrifice dissuades Russell from killing the headmaster and, consequently, saves Cable\\'s family. Cable uses his last charge, reserved for his return trip to his family, to warp back several minutes, strapping Vanessa\\'s token in front of Wade\\'s heart so he survives the bullet. Cable then decides to stay in the present for a while to help improve the world, knowing that his family will be safe in the future. Afterward, the headmaster is run over and killed by Wade\\'s taxi driver friend Dopinder. In a midcredits sequence Negasonic and her girlfriend Yukio repair Cable\\'s timetraveling device for Wade. He uses it to save the lives of Vanessa and XForce member Peter, as well as to kill both an alternate version of himself confronting Wolverine, and Ryan Reynolds after he finishes reading the screenplay for Green Lantern.",

            "plot": "On a suburban street at night, a black man walks alone, talking on the phone. A car pulls up to the curb beside him; sensing trouble, he starts to walk away. Suddenly, a person wearing a helmet that conceals their face tackles him to the ground, subdues him, and drags him into the car, which drives off into the night. Twenty-six-year-old Chris Washington, a black photographer, travels to upstate New York for a weekend getaway to meet the family of his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage. He has uncomfortable conversations with her parents, Dean, a neurosurgeon, and Missy, a psychiatrist. Later, her brother Jeremy arrives and shares embarrassing stories about Rose at dinner. Chris also observes eerie behavior from the familys black servants, Georgina and Walter. Missy tricks Chris into a hypnotherapy session, using the noise of a spoon stirring in a teacup as a hypnotic trigger, ostensibly to cure his smoking addiction. While in a trance, he reveals that his mother was killed in a hitandrun when he was a child, and he feels guilty because he waited too long to call for help. At Missys prompting, his consciousness falls into a dark void she calls the sunken place, where he becomes powerless. The next morning, he finds that his desire to smoke has vanished. Dozens of wealthy white guests arrive for the Armitages annual gettogether, and Chris feels uncomfortable with their remarks about him. He meets a blind art dealer, Jim Hudson, who takes an interest in his photography, and Logan King, another black man whom Chris finds oddly familiar. Like Walter and Georgina, Logan behaves strangely and is married to a white woman thirty years his senior. When Chris tries to photograph Logan, the camera flash causes Logan to become hysterical, rushing at Chris and shouting frantically for him to get out. The party guests hold a silent auction, where Hudson makes the winning bid, with Chris as the prize. Chris sends a photo of Logan to his friend, TSA officer Rod Williams, who recognizes Logan as Andre Hayworth, a missing man from Brooklyn. Chris then discovers photos of Rose with numerous black partners, including Walter and Georgina, contradicting her claim that he is her first black boyfriend. As he tries to leave, Rose refuses to give him the car keys. Jeremy blocks the door, and Missy uses the hypnotic trigger to send Chris back to the sunken place. Chris awakens strapped to an armchair in the basement. In a video, Hudson explains that the family transplants the brains of wealthy white people into others bodies to acquire their desired physical characteristics, leaving the hosts consciousnesses trapped in the sunken place. Hudson clarifies that he doesnt care about Chris racehe only wants his eyesight. Meanwhile, Rod, who has been trying to contact Chris and suspects foul play, goes to the police, but they dismiss his concerns as paranoia about sex trafficking. Missy attempts to hypnotize Chris again, but he blocks the trigger by plugging his ears with cotton stuffing from the armchair. He bludgeons Jeremy, kills Dean and Missy, and finishes off Jeremy when he attacks again. Chris tries to escape in Jeremys Porsche but accidentally hits Georgina, who is possessed by Roses grandmother, Marianne. Compelled by guilt over his mothers death, he goes back to help her, but she attacks him, causing the car to crash and killing her. Rose and Walter, who is possessed by Roses grandfather, Roman, arrive to capture Chris. He uses his phones flash to briefly free Walter from Romans control. Walter then takes Roses rifle, shoots her, and turns the gun on himself. Rod arrives in a TSA car and picks up Chris, leaving Rose bleeding on the road.",

Deacon requests that Jackie bring virgins to the flat so that the vampires can feed on them. She lures a woman who insulted her in primary school and her ex-boyfriend Nick to the flat. Though neither are actually virgins, the woman is killed, and Nick is chased throughout the flat and manages to get outside, only to be caught by Petyr, who turns him into a vampire. Two months later, the vampires accept Nick into their group and bond with his human friend Stu, a computer analyst who introduces them to modern technology. Viago uses the Internet to find Katherine, who is now a 96-year-old widow living in a rest home in Wellington, and also briefly reconnects with his old servant Philip. Despite being able to get his new friends into popular bars and clubs, Nick struggles to adapt to life as a vampire. Nick is also held in contempt by Deacon, who resents Nick\\'s newfound popularity and his careless revealing of his vampirism to strangers he meets. One of these strangers, a vampire hunter, breaks into the flat basement during the day and kills Petyr by exposing him to sunlight. The vampires are furious when they discover Nick has indirectly caused Petyr\\'s death, and Deacon tries to kill Nick before being interrupted by a police welfare check, but Viago hypnotizes them into not noticing anything out of the ordinary. Once the police leave, Nick is banished from the flat by the remaining vampires, though Stu is permitted to come as he pleases. Several months later, the vampires receive an invitation to the annual Unholy Masquerade, hosted for the local undead population of vampires, zombies, and witches. Vladislav refuses to attend after learning that the Beast will be the guest of honor. When Viago and Deacon arrive at the ball, they find in attendance Nick, Stu and Jackie, the latter of whom has been turned into a vampire by Nick. The Beast is revealed to be Vladislavs ex-girlfriend Pauline, and when Stu and the camera crew are discovered to be living humans, the party guests threaten to kill and feed on them. Vladislav arrives and fights with Paulines new boyfriend Julian. Stu impales Julian on a flagpole, and the vampires and camera crew escape the ball with him, only to encounter a rival pack of werewolves who transform under the full moon. Stu and one of the cameramen are mauled. Believing Stu to be dead, the vampires run away and grieve for him. After an indeterminate amount of time, Nick returns to the flat with Stu, who reveals he has survived the attack and was transformed into a werewolf. With Stus urging, the pack visits the vampires along with Stu, and Nick\\'s banishment is rescinded as well. Though momentarily apprehensive, Deacon invites the werewolf pack inside. Viago also reconnects and rekindles his romance with Katherine, whom he turns into a vampire. Scenes during the credits reveal that Vladislav has gotten back together with Pauline, repeating his cycle of self-inflicted torture over his relationship with her; and Jackies husband is now serving as her familiar. A post-credits scene shows Deacon attempting to hypnotize the audience to forget the events of the film.",

            "plot": "In 1997, Lee Unwin, a probationary secret agent, sacrifices himself in the Middle East to save his superior Harry Hart. Blaming himself for Lees death, Harry returns to London and gives Lees son Gary Eggsy Unwin a medal engraved with an emergency assistance number. Seventeen years later, Eggsy is a rebellious chav, having dropped out of training for the Royal Marines despite his cunning and athletic talent. Arrested for stealing a car that belongs to a friend of his abusive stepfather, Dean, Eggsy calls the emergency number, leading Harry to arrange his release and subdue Deans gang. Harry explains that he is a member of Kingsman, a private intelligence service founded by the British elite, who lost their heirs in the First World War and put their money toward protecting the world. The organisation is named for the tailor shop in Savile Row used as a front for their operations. Codenamed Galahad, Harry nominates Eggsy to replace agent Lancelot, who was killed by the assassin Gazelle while trying to rescue radical climate change scientist Prof. James Arnold from kidnappers. Kingsmans technical support operative Merlin discovers Arnold working as though nothing has happened. Hart attempts to interrogate Arnold at Imperial College London, but a microchip in Arnolds neck explodes, killing him and putting Harry in a coma. The detonation signal is traced to Gazelles employer Richmond Valentine, a billionaire philanthropist who has offered everyone in the world SIM cards with free cellular and Internet access. Hart, after recovering from his coma, poses as another philanthropist to meet Valentine. Eggsy befriends fellow Kingsman trainee Roxy, while the elite other boys make fun of him. He endures Merlins tests until they are the only candidates left. However, Eggsy refuses his final test, seemingly shooting a puppy he was given to raiseand Roxy is named the new Lancelot. Harry learns of Valentines connection to a religious hate group and travels to their church in Kentucky, wearing glasses containing a video transceiver. As Eggsy watches Harrys footage, Valentine triggers the SIM cards inside the church with a signal that causes the parishioners and Harry to become murderously violent. Harry is the only survivor but is shot in the face outside the church by Valentine. Eggsy returns to Kingsman headquarters and notices Chester King, codename Arthur and Kingsmans leader, has the same implantation scar on his neck as Arnold. King reveals Valentines plan to transmit his violenceinducing signal worldwide, culling most of humanity to avert its extinction from global warming. Valentine has recruited various world leaders and wealthy elite to his cause, implanted with chips to protect them from the signal; those who refuse are held captive at his bunker, including Crown Princess Tilde of Sweden. King poisons Eggsys drink, but Eggsy switches glasses while distracting him, letting King poison himself instead and extracts the chip from Kings neck. Eggsy, Merlin and Roxy locate Valentines bunker, where many of his conspirators are gathered. Roxy pilots highaltitude balloons to break up Valentines satellite network, but he secures a replacement. Merlin flies to the bunker, where Eggsy masquerades as King, but is discovered by failed Kingsman recruit Charlie Hesketh. Cornered by Valentines men, Merlin activates the implanted chips failsafe, killing the guards and conspirators as heads explode around the world. Valentine activates the signal, triggering worldwide pandemonium. Eggsy kills Gazelle and impales Valentine with one of Gazelles sharpened prosthetic blades, stopping the signal. Eggsy, now the new Galahad, offers his mother and baby halfsister a new home and prepares to take on Dean and his gang, just as Harry once did.",

            "plot": "When Litwaks Amusement Arcade closes, the video game characters leave their in-game roles and socialize via a power strip called Game Central Station. Wreck-It Ralph, the villain of platform game Fix-It Felix, Jr, is frustrated with his assigned role. After being excluded from his games 30th-anniversary party, Ralph decides to win a medal, convinced that it will earn him respect. Upon learning that the first-person shooter Heros Duty awards medals, Ralph sneaks into Heros Duty and obtains a medal after getting past insectoid monsters known as Cy-Bugs. Ralph accidentally launches himself in an escape shuttle with a Cy-Bug inside and crash-lands in Sugar Rush, a confectionery-themed kart racing game. With Ralph gone, his game is labeled out of order, putting it at risk of being unplugged. Fix-It Felix, Jr himself leaves the game to find Ralph, allying with Sergeant Calhoun, the heroine of Heros Duty. Calhoun tracks the Cy-Bug, as Cy-Bugs behave as a virus once outside their game. Felix worries Ralph will meet the same fate as Turbo, the protagonist of the racing game TurboTime, who grew envious of a new RoadBlasters cabinets success and invaded it, resulting in both games being unplugged. In Sugar Rush, racer Vanellope von Schweetz steals Ralphs medal and uses it to buy her way into the nightly race that determines which characters will be playable the next day. King Candy, the ruler of Sugar Rushs world, forbids her to race, as she is a glitch. Vanellope promises to get the medal back if Ralph helps her win; he helps her build a new kart and teaches her to drive inside Diet Cola Mountain. Meanwhile, Calhoun and Felix arrive in Sugar Rush, where they fall into Nesquik-sand, work together to escape, and begin to fall in love. King Candy hacks into Sugar Rushs code and retrieves the medal, giving it back to Ralph. He claims that if Vanellope becomes a playable character, her glitching will lead to Sugar Rush being labeled out of order and unplugged, and Vanellope, unable to leave the game due to being a glitch, will die. Ralph decides he cannot allow Vanellope to race and destroys her kart. Meanwhile, Calhoun abandons Felix when he unintentionally reminds her of her late fianc\u00e9, who was eaten by a Cy-Bug. Felix is imprisoned by King Candys assistant, Sour Bill, while Calhoun discovers that the Cy-Bug has multiplied exponentially. Upon returning to Fix-It Felix, Jr, which has been evacuated, Ralph notices an image of Vanellope on the Sugar Rush cabinet. He returns to Sugar Rush and interrogates Sour Bill, who reveals that King Candy damaged Vanellopes code. King Candys edits to the code also have ensured no one but himself knows Vanellopes true role. However, if Vanellope completes a race, the game will reset itself, deleting all of King Candys changes. Ralph frees Vanellope and Felix from prison. Felix fixes Vanellopes kart. Vanellope belatedly enters the race, but the Cy-Bugs emerge and start destroying the game. Calhoun, Felix, and Ralph help evacuate the characters. Unaware of the Cy-Bugs, King Candy attempts to ram Vanellope off the track, causing them both to glitch. The glitching unmasks King Candy as Turbo, who secretly took over Sugar Rush after surviving the unplugging of TurboTime. Vanellope flees as Turbo is devoured by a Cy-Bug, which fuses with him into an insectoid monster. As glitches cannot leave their games, Vanellope is unable to evacuate. Remembering from Heros Duty that a beacon will draw and destroy the Cy-Bugs, Ralph battles Turbo who stalled him and collapses the Mentos roof of Diet Cola Mountain, creating a glowing eruption that lures and destroys Turbo and the Cy-Bugs. Vanellope rescues Ralph and crosses the finish line. The game resets, revealing her as the true ruler of Sugar Rush, though she keeps her glitching ability, considering it an advantage. Ralph returns to his game, content with his role as a villain and finally respected by his fellow characters. Felix and Calhoun marry, and Ralph watches Vanellope become Sugar Rushs favorite character.",

            "plot": "In 2010, disillusioned screenwriter Gil Pender and his fianc\u00e9e, Inez, vacation in Paris with Inez\\'s wealthy parents. Gil, struggling to finish his debut novel about a man who works in a nostalgia shop, finds himself drawn to the artistic history of Paris, especially the Lost Generation of the 1920s, and has ambitions to move there, which Inez dismisses. By chance, they meet Inez\\'s friend, Paul, and his wife, Carol. Paul speaks with great authority but questionable accuracy on French history, annoying Gil but impressing Inez. Intoxicated after a night of wine tasting, Gil decides to walk back to their hotel, while Inez goes with Paul and Carol by taxi. At midnight, a 1920s car pulls up beside Gil and delivers him to a party for Jean Cocteau, attended by other people of the 1920s Paris art scene. Zelda Fitzgerald, bored, encourages her husband Scott and Gil to leave with her. They head to a cafe where they run into Ernest Hemingway and Juan Belmonte. After Zelda and Scott leave, Gil and Hemingway discuss writing, and Hemingway offers to show Gil\\'s novel to Gertrude Stein. As Gil leaves to fetch his manuscript, he returns to 2010; the cafe is now a laundromat. The next night, Gil tries to repeat the experience with Inez, but she leaves before midnight. Returning to the 1920s, Gil accompanies Hemingway to visit Gertrude Stein, who critiques Pablo Picasso\\'s new painting of his lover Adriana. Gil becomes drawn to Adriana, a costume designer who also had affairs with Amedeo Modigliani and Georges Braque. Adriana having heard the first line of Gil\\'s novel, praises it, and admits she has always had a longing for the past. Gil continues to time travel the following nights. Inez grows jaded with Paris and Gil\\'s constant disappearing, while her father grows suspicious and hires a private detective to follow him. Adriana leaves Picasso and continues to bond with Gil, who is conflicted by his attraction to her. Gil explains his situation to Salvador Dal\u00ed, Man Ray, and Luis Bu\u00f1uel; as surrealists, they do not question his claim of coming from the future. Gil later suggests the plot of \"The Exterminating Angel\" to Bu\u00f1uel. While Inez and her parents travel to Mont Saint Michel, Gil meets Gabrielle, an antique dealer and fellow admirer of the Lost Generation. He later finds Adriana\\'s diary at a book stall, which reveals that she was in love with Gil and dreamed of being gifted earrings before making love to him. To seduce Adriana, Gil tries to steal a pair of Inez\\'s earrings but is thwarted by her early return to the hotel room. Gil buys new earrings and returns to the past. After he gives Adriana the earrings, a horse-drawn carriage arrives, transporting them to the Belle \u00c9poque, an era Adriana considers Paris\\'s Golden Age. They go to the Moulin Rouge where they meet Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, and Edgar Degas, who all agree that Paris\\'s best era was the Renaissance. Adriana is offered a job designing ballet costumes; thrilled, she proposes to Gil that they stay, but he, observing the unhappiness of Adriana and the other artists, realizes that chasing nostalgia is fruitless because the present is always \"a little unsatisfying.\" Adriana decides to stay, and they part ways. Gil rewrites the first two chapters of his novel and retrieves his draft from Stein, who praises his rewrite but says that on reading the new chapters, Hemingway did not believe that the protagonist does not realize that his fianc\u00e9e, based on Inez, is having an affair with the character based on Paul. Gil returns to 2010 and confronts Inez, who admits to having slept with Paul but disregards it as a meaningless fling. Gil breaks up with her and decides to move to Paris. The detective following him takes a \"wrong turn\" and ends up being chased by the palace guards of Louis XVI just before a revolution breaks out. While walking by the Seine at midnight, Gil encounters Gabrielle. As it begins to rain, he offers to walk her home and learns that they share a love for Paris in the rain.",

            "plot": "In the Lego universe, the wizard Vitruvius is blinded when he fails to protect a superweapon called the Kragle from the evil Lord Business but prophesies that a person called The Special will find the Piece of Resistance capable of stopping the Kragle. Lord Business believes Vitruvius simply made up the prophecy, and kicks him away. Eight and a half years later, in Bricksburg, an optimistic but unimaginative construction worker named Emmet Brickowski comes across a woman searching for something at his construction site. Emmet falls into a pit and finds the Piece of Resistance. Compelled to touch it, he experiences visions, including one of a giant called the Man Upstairs and passes out. He awakens in the custody of Bad Cop, Business\u2019s lieutenant, and discovers that the Piece of Resistance is attached to his own back. Emmet learns of Business\u2019s plans to freeze the world with the Kragle; the Piece of Resistance is the glue tube\u2019s cap. The woman, Wyldstyle, rescues Emmet, believing him to be the Special. They escape Bad Cop and travel to The Old West, where they meet Vitruvius. He and Wyldstyle are Master Builders, capable of building anything without instruction manuals, who oppose Business\u2019s attempts to suppress their creativity. Though disappointed Emmet is not a Master Builder, they are convinced of his potential when he recalls visions of the Man Upstairs. Emmet, Wyldstyle, and Vitruvius evade Bad Cop\u2019s forces with the help of Wyldstyle\u2019s boyfriend, Batman, and escape to Cloud Cuckoo Land, where all the Master Builders are in hiding. The Master Builders are unimpressed with Emmet and refuse to help him fight Business. Bad Cop\u2019s forces attack and capture everyone except Emmet, Wyldstyle, Vitruvius, Batman, and fellow Master Builders MetalBeard, Unikitty, and Benny. Emmet devises a plan to infiltrate Business\u2019s headquarters and disarm the Kragle. The heist almost succeeds until Emmet and his friends are captured and imprisoned. Business decapitates Vitruvius and throws the Piece of Resistance into an abyss before arming a self-destruct device to execute all the captured Master Builders. Before he dies, Vitruvius reveals he made up the prophecy, but his spirit returns to tell Emmet that Emmet\u2019s self-belief makes him the Special. Strapped to the self-destruct mechanism\u2019s battery, Emmet flings himself off the edge of the tower and into the abyss, disarming the mechanism and saving his friends and the Master Builders. Inspired by Emmet\u2019s sacrifice, Wyldstyle, who reveals her real name to be Lucy, rallies the Lego people across the universe to use whatever creativity they have to build machines and weapons to fight Business\u2019s forces. The abyss transports Emmet to the human world, where the events of his life are being played out in a basement by a boy named Finn on his father\u2019s Lego set. Finn\u2019s father, revealed to be the Man Upstairs, chastises his son for creating hodgepodges of different playsets and begins to glue his perceived perfect creations together permanently. Realizing the danger, Emmet wills himself to move and gains Finn\u2019s attention. Finn returns Emmet and the Piece of Resistance to the set, where Emmet becomes a Master Builder and confronts Business. In the human world, Finn\u2019s father looks at his son\u2019s creations and realizes he is suppressing his son\u2019s creativity. Through a speech by Emmet, Finn calls his father very special and says he has the power to change everything. Finn\u2019s father reconciles with his son, which plays out as Business reforming, capping the Kragle with the Piece of Resistance, and ungluing his victims with mineral spirits. After the world is restored, Lucy and Emmet enter a relationship with Batman\u2019s blessing. Finn\u2019s father grants Finn and his younger sister permission to play with the Lego sets as well, causing Duplo aliens to arrive in the Lego universe and threaten destruction",

            "plot": "In 2259, Captain James T Kirk is removed from command of the starship USS Enterprise for violating the Prime Directive by revealing the ship to the primitive inhabitants of the planet Nibiru in order to save them, and Spock, from a cataclysmic volcanic eruption. Admiral Christopher Pike is reinstated as commanding officer with Kirk demoted to first officer. Spock is transferred to another ship. Shortly after, Starfleet officer Thomas Harewood, sent by Commander John Harrison, bombs a Section 31 installation in London. During an emergency meeting on the situation, Harrison uses a ship to ambush and kill Pike and other senior officers, before transporting to Kronos, homeworld of the Klingons.Admiral Alexander Marcus reinstates Kirk and Spock to the Enterprise with orders to kill Harrison using a new long-range stealth torpedo. Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott objects to allowing untested torpedoes on board without knowing their specifications; when he is overruled, he resigns. Kirk assigns Pavel Chekov to replace Scotty. En route to Kronos, Enterprises warp capabilities become disabled. Kirk leads a team with Spock and Uhura to the planet, where they are ambushed by Klingon patrols. Harrison appears and kills the Klingons. Harrison surrenders when he learns the precise number of torpedoes on board Enterprise.Dr Leonard McCoy and Marcuss daughter, Dr Carol Marcus, open a torpedo at Harrisons urging, revealing the torpedoes contain cryonically frozen humans. Harrison is taken to Enterprises brig, where he reveals his true identity as Khan Noonien Singh, a genetically engineered superhuman, awoken by Admiral Marcus from centuries of sleep and forced to develop advanced weapons. Khan reveals that Marcus sabotaged Enterprises warp drive, intending for the Klingons to destroy the ship after it fired on Kronos, sparking a war with the Klingon Empire. Khan also gives Kirk a set of coordinates, which Kirk asks Scott to investigate. Scott discovers the coordinates lead to a covert Starfleet facility.Enterprise is intercepted by a much larger Starfleet warship, USS Vengeance, commanded by Admiral Marcus. Marcus demands that Kirk deliver Khan, but Enterprise flees to Earth to expose him. After Vengeance disables Enterprise near the Moon, Carol reveals her presence aboard Enterprise to stop the attack. Marcus forcibly transports Carol to Vengeance before ordering Enterprises destruction. Vengeance loses power after being sabotaged by Scott, who infiltrated the ship. With transporters down, Kirk and Khan, with the latters knowledge of the warships design, spacejump to Vengeance. Meanwhile, Spock contacts his future self on New Vulcan, who tells him of his own encounter with Khan and warns that he cannot be trusted. After fighting their way to the bridge, Khan overpowers Kirk, Scott, and Carol, kills Marcus, and takes control of Vengeance.Khan demands that Spock return his frozen crew in exchange for the Enterprise officers. Spock complies, having had McCoy surreptitiously remove Khans frozen crew from the torpedoes beforehand. When Khan starts shooting at Enterprise, Spock detonates the warheads, crippling the ship. With both starships caught in Earths gravity, they plummet toward the surface. Kirk enters Enterprises radioactive reactor chamber to realign the warp core, sacrificing himself to save the ship.Khan crashes Vengeance into San Francisco in an attempt to destroy Starfleet headquarters, while McCoy discovers that Khans blood has regenerative properties that may save Kirk. A vengeful Spock pursues Khan through the city and the two engage in handtohand combat. As Spock prepares to kill Khan, Uhura beams down and stops him, revealing that he is their only chance to save Kirk. Khans blood revives Kirk and Khan is sealed in his cryogenic pod and stored with his compatriots. One year later, Kirk speaks at Enterprises rededication ceremony. The Enterprise crew embarks on a fiveyear exploratory mission.",

            "plot": "On October 28, 2003, 19-year-old Harvard University sophomore Mark Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend, Erica Albright. Returning to his dorm, Zuckerberg writes an insulting post about Albright on his LiveJournal blog. He creates a campus website called Facemash by hacking and downloading photos of female students from house face books, then allowing site visitors to rate their attractiveness. After traffic to the site crashes parts of Harvard\\'s computer network, Zuckerberg is given six months of academic probation.Facemash\u2019s popularity attracts the attention of twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their business partner Divya Narendra. The trio invites Zuckerberg to work on Harvard Connection, a social network exclusive to Harvard students and aimed at dating. Zuckerberg approaches his friend Eduardo Saverin with an idea for Thefacebook, a social networking website that would be exclusive to Ivy League students. Saverin provides $1,000 in seed funding, allowing Zuckerberg to build the website, which quickly becomes popular. When they learn of Thefacebook, the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed, believing that Zuckerberg stole their idea while misleading them by stalling development on the Harvard Connection website. They raise their complaint with Harvard President Larry Summers, who is dismissive and sees no value in disciplinary action on Thefacebook or Zuckerberg.Saverin and Zuckerberg meet fellow student Christy Lee, who asks them to Facebook me, which impresses them. As Thefacebook grows in popularity, Zuckerberg expands the network to Yale, Columbia, and Stanford. Lee arranges for Saverin and Zuckerberg to meet Napster co-founder Sean Parker, who presents a billion-dollar vision for the company. Zuckerberg is impressed, but Saverin dismisses him as paranoid and delusional. Parker also suggests dropping the in Thefacebook and simply renaming the site to Facebook.Later, Zuckerberg relocates the company to Palo Alto, based on Parker\\'s advice; Saverin remains in New York to work on business development. Parker later moves into the house that Zuckerberg is using as a base of operations and becomes more involved with the company, much to Saverin\\'s annoyance.After narrowly losing in the 2004 Henley Royal Regatta for Harvard against the Hollandia Roeiclub, the Winklevoss twins discover that Facebook has expanded to Europe with Oxford, Cambridge and LSE, and decide to sue the company for intellectual property theft. Meanwhile, Saverin objects to Parker making business decisions for Facebook and freezes the company\\'s bank account in the resulting dispute. He relents when Zuckerberg reveals that they have secured $500,000 from angel investor Peter Thiel.After traveling to the company\\'s new headquarters on the pretense of attending a business meeting and millionth user party, Saverin becomes enraged when he discovers that the new investment deal allows his share of Facebook to be diluted from 34% to 0.03%, without diluting the ownership percentage of any other owner. He confronts Zuckerberg and Parker, and Saverin vows to sue Zuckerberg. Saverin\\'s name had already been removed from the masthead as co-founder and CFO; Parker tells him that he is no longer a part of Facebook and has security eject him from the building.Later, Parker is apprehended for cocaine possession with a minor at a party celebrating one million users. He attempts to blame Saverin, so Zuckerberg cuts ties with him, telling him to go home.In separate depositions, the Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin since the sordid details of Facebook\\'s founding and Zuckerberg\\'s callous attitude will make him unsympathetic to a jury. Alone, Zuckerberg sends a Facebook friend request to Albright and repeatedly refreshes the page.",

            "plot": "Two days before his wedding, bachelor Doug Billings travels to Las Vegas with his best friends Phil Wenneck, a sarcastic secondary school teacher, Stu Price, an apprehensive dentist, and Alan Garner, his odd future brother-in-law. Sid, the father of Dougs fianc\u00e9e Tracy, loans Doug his vintage Mercedes-Benz W111 to drive to Vegas. They book a suite at Caesars Palace and celebrate by sneaking onto the hotel rooftop and taking shots of J\u00e4germeister.The next day, Phil, Stu and Alan awaken, unable to remember the previous night. Doug is nowhere to be found, Stus tooth is missing, the suite is a mess, a Bengal tiger is in the bathroom, and a baby is in the closet. They see Dougs mattress impaled on a statue outside, and when they ask for their Mercedes, the valet delivers a Las Vegas police cruiser.Retracing their steps, the trio travel to a hospital, discovering they were drugged with Rohypnol, causing their memory loss, and that they went there from a chapel the previous night. At the chapel, they learn that Stu married a call girl named Jade, despite his relationship with his shrewish girlfriend Melissa. Outside the chapel, the trio is attacked by a gang of men demanding to know where he is. Bewildered, they flee and track down Jade, who is revealed to be the babys mother.They are arrested by the police for having stolen the cruiser. To get the Mercedes out of impound and get released, the trio unwittingly volunteer to be targets for a taser demonstration. While driving the car, they discover a naked Chinese man named Leslie Chow in the trunk, who attacks the trio and flees. Alan confesses that he drugged their drinks to ensure they had a good night, believing the drug to be Ecstasy.Returning to their suite, they find Mike Tyson, who knocks Alan unconscious and orders them to return his tiger to his mansion. After Stu drugs it, they load it into the Mercedes, and drive to Tysons mansion. However, the tiger awakens and attacks them, scratching Phil on the neck and damaging the cars interior. They push the car the rest of the way to the mansion and deliver the tiger to Tyson, who shows them security camera footage indicating they did not lose Doug until after they got back to the hotel.While driving back, their car is rammed by a black Cadillac Escalade manned by Chow and his gang from the chapel. Chow accuses them of kidnapping him and stealing 80000 in poker chips. As they deny it, he tells them he has Doug, and threatens to kill him if the chips are not returned. Unable to find Chows chips, Alan, with help from Stu and Jade, uses his knowledge of card counting to win 82400 playing blackjack.They meet Chow in the Mojave Desert to exchange the chips for Doug, only to find that the Doug in question is actually the drug dealer who accidentally sold the roofies to Alan. With the real Dougs wedding set to occur in five hours, Phil calls Tracy to tell her they cannot find him. Simultaneously, the other Dougs remarks that someone who takes roofies is more likely to end up on the floor than on the roof, causes Stu to realize where Doug is.They return to Caesars Palace where they find a dazed and badly sunburned Doug on the roof. They moved him there on his mattress as a practical joke, but forgot when the roofies wore off; Doug threw the mattress onto the statue in an attempt to signal for help. Before leaving, Stu makes arrangements to meet Jade for a date the following week.With no flights available, the four drive home in the mangled Mercedes, where Doug reveals that he has Chows original 80000 in his pocket. Despite their late arrival, Doug and Tracy are married. At the reception, Stu gleefully breaks up with Melissa. Alan finds Stus digital camera containing photos of the debauchery from the night in Las Vegas, and the four agree to look at the pictures before deleting them.",

            "plot": "In Istanbul, MI6 agents James Bond and Eve Moneypenny pursue mercenary Patrice, who has stolen a hard drive containing details of undercover NATO agents. As Bond and Patrice fight atop a moving train, M orders Moneypenny to shoot Patrice, despite not having a clear shot; Moneypenny inadvertently hits Bond, who falls into a river. Bond is presumed dead and Patrice escapes with the hard drive. Three months later, due to a public inquiry into M\\'s handling of the stolen hard drive, she is pressured to retire by Gareth Mallory, the chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament and a former SAS officer. Although she says she is still useful, MI6\\'s servers are hacked, and M receives a taunting computer message moments before the MI6 building explodes. Bond, who used his presumed death to retire, learns of the attack and returns to service in London. He fails a series of physical, medical, and psychological examinations, but M approves his return to the field, ordering him to identify Patrice\\'s employer, recover the hard drive, and kill Patrice. He meets Q, MI6\\'s new quartermaster, who gives him a radio beacon and a Walther PPK pistol. In Shanghai, Bond follows Patrice and witnesses him killing a target. The two fight and Patrice dies before Bond can learn his employer\\'s identity. Moneypenny joins Bond in his investigation, on Mallory\\'s orders. Bond finds a casino token Patrice intended to cash in for the assassination, leading him to a casino in Macau. There, Bond is approached by S\u00e9v\u00e9rine, Patrice\\'s accomplice. Recognising her tattoo, he concludes she was a sex slave \"rescued\" by a criminal who now employs her, a man Bond wishes to meet. She warns him he is targeted by her bodyguards, but promises to help if Bond kills her employer. Bond thwarts the attack and joins S\u00e9v\u00e9rine on her yacht, the Chimera. They travel to an abandoned island off the coast of Macau, where the crew captures and delivers them to S\u00e9v\u00e9rine\\'s employer, Raoul Silva. Silva, a former MI6 agent, turned to cyberterrorism and orchestrated the attack on MI6. Silva kills S\u00e9v\u00e9rine. Bond uses Q\\'s radio beacon to alert MI6 reinforcements, who capture Silva for rendition to Britain. At MI6\\'s new underground headquarters, Q attempts to decrypt Silva\\'s laptop, but inadvertently gives it access to the MI6 servers, allowing Silva to escape. Bond and Q conclude that Silva wanted to be captured as part of a plan to kill M, whom he hates for disavowing and betraying him to the Chinese government during the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, leaving him to be tortured and disfigured by a suicide attempt by cyanide pill. Silva escapes his cell and Bond chases him through the London Underground and thwarts Silva\\'s attack at a Parliament inquiry where M is present. Instructing Q and Bill Tanner to leave an electronic trail for Silva to follow, Bond uses his Aston Martin DB5 to take M to Skyfall, his childhood home in the Scottish Highlands. They meet Skyfall\\'s gamekeeper Kincade, and  the trio rigs the house with booby traps. When Silva\\'s men arrive, Bond, M, and Kincade kill most of them, but M is wounded. Silva arrives by helicopter with more men and heavy weapons, so Bond sends M and Kincade through a priest hole to hide in a nearby chapel, and rigs propane tanks to explode. As the house and the helicopter are destroyed, Bond escapes down the same tunnel. Silva survives the destruction of the house, following Kincade and M to the chapel. Confronting M, Silva forces his gun into her hand and presses his temple to hers, begging her to kill them both. Bond arrives and kills Silva by throwing a knife into his back. M then succumbs to her wounds and dies in Bond\\'s arms. Following M\\'s funeral, Moneypenny formally introduces herself to Bond and tells him she is retiring from fieldwork to become secretary for Mallory, the newly appointed M. Bond meets Mallory, and tells him he is ready to get back to work.",

            "plot": "After eight months' treatment in a mental health facility for bipolar disorder, Patrizio Pat Solitano Jr is released into the care of his parents, Patrizio Sr and Dolores, at his childhood home in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania. His primary focus is to reconcile with his ex-wife, Nikki. She has moved away and obtained a restraining order against him after Pat found her in the shower with another man and badly beat him.Pat's therapist, Cliff Patel, tries to convince him to keep taking his medication because a repeat of his violent outbursts might send him back to the clinic. Pat tells him that he has a new outlook on life: He attempts to see the good, or silver linings, in all that he experiences. Meanwhile, Pat experiences a series of anxiety attacks.Pat attends dinner at his best friend Ronnie's house, where Ronnie's sisterinlaw, Tiffany Maxwell, a widow with an unnamed disorder, is also a guest. They connect, talking about different psychiatric medications they have taken to manage their mental illnesses. She tries to offer him casual sex, but Pat is focused on getting Nikki back. Trying to get closer to him, Tiffany offers to deliver a letter to Nikki if, in return, he partners with her in an upcoming dance competition. Convinced that helping Tiffany will show Nikki he has changed and has developed sensitivity to others, Pat agrees. Pat and Tiffany start practicing over the following weeks.Hoping to open a restaurant, Patrizio Sr has resorted to illegal bookmaking. Having bet most of his money on a Philadelphia Eagles game, Patrizio asks Pat to attend for good luck, irrationally believing Pat's attention to the game affects its outcome. Pat points out this is OCD ideation but appeases his father. Pat asks Tiffany for time off from practice to attend the game. She gives him a typed reply from Nikki, which cautiously hints they may be able to reconcile. Before entering the stadium, Pat and his brother Jake get into a fight with racist fans and are arrested. The Eagles lose the game, and Patrizio is furious.When Patrizio claims that the Eagles lost because of Tiffany's newfound involvement in Pat's life, she refutes his allegations by pointing out that Philadelphia sports teams had done better whenever she and Pat were together. Convinced, Patrizio makes a parlay with his friend Randy: If the Eagles win their week 16 game against the Dallas Cowboys and Tiffany and Pat score five out of ten in their dance competition, he will win back double the money he lost on the first bet.Pat is reluctant, but Tiffany, Dolores, and Patrizio conspire to persuade him to dance in the competition, telling him Nikki will be there. Noticing that the letter from Nikki includes the phrase If it's me reading the signs..., frequently used by Tiffany, he realizes that Tiffany fabricated the letter. Tiffany, Pat, and their friends and family arrive at the competition on the night of the football game. Tiffany despairs when she sees Nikki in the audience, invited by Ronnie and his wife Veronica. They want Nikki to lift her restraining order on Pat, giving them the chance to reconcile. Tiffany starts to drink heavily at the bar.Pat finds Tiffany moments before their turn and drags her onto the dance floor. They begin their routine as the Eagles defeat the Cowboys. After their set, Tiffany and Pat receive an average score of exactly 50 points amid cheers from friends and family and confused looks from the crowd. Pat approaches Nikki and whispers into her ear. Seeing this, Tiffany runs off. Pat Sr tells his son that unlike Nikki, Tiffany really loves him, and he should not let her go, as it would haunt him for the rest of his life. Pat catches Tiffany and hands her a letter in which he admits to knowing she forged the letter earlier. He confesses that he loved her from the moment they became acquainted, but that it took him a long time to realize and accept it. They share a kiss. Patrizio opens a restaurant with the money he has won, and Pat and Tiffany begin a relationship, no longer wearing their wedding rings.",

            "plot": "Two bookies are separately ambushed and murdered. In a bus terminal, a young man is approached by Goodkat, who tells the story of Max: two decades earlier, Max borrowed money from the Mob to bet on a fixed horse race after eavesdropping on conversations between mobsters, only for the horse to die mid-race. To set an example to make sure nobody else will try to bet on a fixed race, the Mob killed Max, his wife, and his son Henry. Goodkat then describes the Kansas City Shuffle, a misleading double bluff, and kills the young man, taking the body in a truck. In New York City, Slevin Kelevra is staying in his friend Nick Fisher\\'s apartment and, upon being visited by neighbor Lindsey, discusses Nick\\'s disappearance and why the apartment was unlocked. Lindsey suggests that Nick might be missing, and after she leaves, Slevin is kidnapped by two henchmen, who take him to The Boss. Mistaking Slevin for Nick, The Boss orders him to repay a gambling debt or kill the son of his rival, The Rabbi; Believing The Rabbi is responsible for assassinating his son seen in the intro, The Boss wants The Rabbi\\'s homosexual son, Yitzchok The Fairy, to be killed in revenge. Slevin returns to the apartment but is kidnapped again, this time by two of The Rabbi\\'s Jewish henchmen. The Rabbi also mistakes Slevin for Nick and also demands he repay a gambling debt. Slevin tells The Boss he will kill Yitzchok. Meanwhile, it becomes apparent that Goodkat is involved with both sides, that he is responsible for Nick\\'s debts being called in, and that he plans to kill Slevin after Yitzchok dies and make it look like they both committed suicide. Slevin is approached by Detective Brikowski, who is investigating The Boss and The Rabbi. Brikowski has also been informed that Goodkat is back in town for the first time in twenty years and thinks there is a connection between The Boss, The Rabbi, Goodkat, and Slevin. After pretending to be gay, Slevin gets invited to Yitzchok\\'s apartment, where he and Goodkat kill Yitzchok and his bodyguards. The two then kidnap The Boss and The Rabbi, whom they restrain in The Boss\\'s penthouse. There, Slevin reveals he is Henry, Max\\'s son. The mobsters who killed Max were The Boss and The Rabbi. Goodkat was the assassin hired to kill young Henry. After an attack of conscience, Goodkat raised Henry as his own. Slevin suffocates The Rabbi and The Boss by taping plastic bags over their heads, killing them the same way they killed his father. Since Lindsey photographed Goodkat while investigating Nick\\'s disappearance, Goodkat shoots her to protect his identity. While hunting for Slevin, Brikowski gets a phone call from his boss and learns the meaning of the pseudonym Slevin Kelevra: Lucky Number Slevin was the horse Max had bet on, and Kelevra is Hebrew for bad dog, mirroring Goodkat\\'s name. Brikowski murdered Slevin\\'s mother to pay his own gambling debts twenty years ago. As he hears this story, Brikowski resigns himself to his fate as Slevin appears in his back seat and shoots him. Later, at the bus terminal, Slevin is met by Lindsey. Goodkat previously informed Slevin that he had to murder Lindsey. However, Slevin explained his true identity to Lindsey and helped fake her death. When Goodkat appears, aware of the deception, Slevin explains he had to save her and did not think Goodkat would understand. Having saved Slevin as a boy, Goodkat states that he understands and agrees to leave Lindsey alone. Goodkat returns Slevin\\'s father\\'s old watch and disappears into the crowd.",

            "plot": "The story centres mainly upon six characters: Gordon (a Lieutenant of the Royal Scots Fusiliers); Audebert (a French Lieutenant in the 26th Infantry and reluctant son of a general); Horstmayer (a Jewish German Lieutenant of the 93rd Infantry); Father Palmer (a Scottish priest working as a chaplain and stretcherbearer); and two famous opera stars, German tenor Nikolaus Sprink (based on Walter Kirchhoff) and his Danish fianc\u00e9e, mezzo-soprano Anna S\u00f8rensen.The film begins with scenes of schoolboys reciting patriotic speeches that both praise their countries and condemn their enemies. In Scotland, two young brothers, Jonathan and William, join up to fight, followed by their priest, Father Palmer, who becomes a chaplain. In Germany, Sprink is interrupted during a performance by a German officer announcing a reserve call up. French soldier Audebert looks at a photograph of his pregnant wife, whom he has had to leave behind (in the occupied part of France, just in front of his trench), and prepares to exit into the trenches for an Allied assault on German lines. However, the assault fails, with the French and British taking many casualties while William loses his life.In Germany, Anna gets permission to perform for Crown Prince Wilhelm, and Sprink is allowed to accompany her. They spend a night together and then perform. Afterward, Sprink expresses bitterness at the comfort of the generals at their headquarters and resolves to go back to the front to sing for the troops. Sprink initially opposes Annas decision to go with him, but he agrees shortly afterward.The unofficial truce begins when the British begin to sing festive songs and songs from home, accompanied by bagpipes. Sprink and S\u00f8rensen arrive on the German front line, and Sprink sings for his comrades. As Sprink sings Silent Night, he is accompanied by Father Palmers bagpipes from the Scottish front line. Sprink responds to Palmer and exits his trench with a small Christmas tree, singing Adeste Fideles. Following Sprinks lead, Audebert, Horstmayer, and Gordon meet in no mans land and agree on a cease-fire for the evening.The various soldiers meet and wish each other Joyeux No\u00ebl, Frohe Weihnachten, and Merry Christmas. They exchange chocolate, champagne, and photographs of loved ones. Horstmayer gives Audebert back his wallet containing a photograph of his wife, which was lost in the attack a few days prior, and they connect over pre-war memories. Father Palmer celebrates a brief Mass for the soldiers (in Latin as was the practice in the Catholic Church at that time), and the soldiers retire deeply moved. However, Jonathan remains totally unmoved by the events around him, choosing to grieve for his brother. The following morning, the Lieutenants agree to extend the truce to allow each side to bury their dead, followed by cordial fraternisation for the rest of the day. As their soldiers play football, Audebert and Horstmayer sympathise, speaking in French of their memories of Paris and Lens, and their families. Horstmayer offers to take a letter to Lens for Audeberts wife. The next day, as the German forces shell the Allied position, Horstmayer offers to shelter the French and British soldiers in his trench, an offer Audebert and Gordon return to protect the Germans from their own retaliatory bombing. Before parting, aware that the truce has now truly ended, Audebert and Horstmayer lament that they cannot be friends, and hope that they both survive the war. As Audebert compliments Horstmayer on his French, the German reveals that his wife is French.Prior to the bombing, Horstmayer learns that Anna and Sprink left without the German superiors assent to entertain fellow front soldiers and informs both that Sprink is going to be arrested for disobedience. As the Germans regain their trenches, Anna and Sprink remain behind and ask Audebert to take them as captives, in order to avoid separation. Letters that they hand over to him from the German soldiers (who had been hoping Anna would deliver them when she returned to Berlin), as well as letters from soldiers all across the front, are intercepted by military authorities, revealing that the truce had occurred.Father Palmer is being sent back to his own parish and his battalion is disbanded as a mark of shame. Despite emphasising the humanity and goodwill of the truce, he is rebuked by the bishop, who then preaches an antiGerman sermon to new recruits, in which he describes the Germans as inhumane and commands the recruits to kill every one of them. Father Palmer overhears the sermon and removes his cross as he leaves.Back in the trenches, the British are ordered by a furious major (who is angered by the truce) to shoot a German soldier who is entering no mans land and crossing towards French lines. All of the soldiers deliberately miss in response, except the bitter Jonathan, who shoots the targeted German soldier. Audebert, hearing the familiar alarm clock ringing outside, rushes out and discovers that the soldier is a disguised Ponchel, his batman. With his dying words, Ponchel reveals he gained help from the German soldiers, visited his mother, and had coffee with her. He also informs Audebert that he has a young son named Henri.Audebert is punished by being sent to Verdun, and he receives a dressing down from his father, a general. In a culminating rant, young Audebert upbraids his father, expressing no remorse at the fraternisation at the front, and his disgust for civilians and superiors who talk of sacrifice but know nothing of the struggle in the trenches. He also informs the general about his new grandson Henri. Moved by this revelation, the general then recommends they both try and survive this war for him.Horstmayer and his troops, who are confined in a train, are informed by the German Crown Prince that they are to be shipped to the Eastern Front, without permission to see their families as they pass through Germany. He then stomps on J\u00f6rgs harmonica and says that Horstmayer does not deserve his Iron Cross. As the train departs, the Germans start humming a British carol they learnt from the British. The carol in question, LHymne des Fraternis\u00e9s  Im Dreaming of Home, is in fact a modern composition by Lori Barth and Philippe Rombi.",

            "plot": "In Wyoming in 1963, cowboys Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist are hired by Joe Aguirre to herd his sheep through the summer on grazing pastures on Brokeback Mountain. After a night of heavy drinking, Jack makes a pass at Ennis. While initially reluctant, Ennis becomes receptive, and he and Jack have sex in their tent. Despite Ennis telling Jack that it was a one-time incident, they develop a sexual and emotional relationship. Near the end of their work contract, Ennis and Jack have a brawl that leaves both of them bloodied. Before parting ways, Ennis offhandedly laments that he left one of his shirts on the mountain. Ennis marries his longtime fianc\u00e9e Alma Beers and they have two daughters: Alma Jr. and Jenny. Jack returns the next summer seeking work, but Aguirre, who observed Jack and Ennis engaging in homosexual activity on the mountain, refuses to hire him. Jack moves to Texas, where he met rodeo rider Lureen Newsome, the daughter of a wealthy businessman; they marry and have a son. After four years apart, Jack visits Ennis. Upon meeting, they kiss passionately, which a stunned Alma inadvertently witnesses. At a motel room, Jack wants them to create a life together, but Ennis refuses to abandon his family and is haunted by a childhood memory of his father showing him a man\\'s body who was tortured and killed for suspected homosexuality. Ennis and Jack meet infrequently for private fishing trips while their respective marriages deteriorate. Lureen abandons the rodeo and goes into business with her father, with Jack working in sales. Alma and Ennis divorce in 1975. Upon hearing about it, Jack drives to Wyoming and tells Ennis that they should live together, but Ennis refuses to move away from his children. Alma takes custody of Alma Jr. and Jenny, and marries Monroe, manager of the grocery store where she works. Ennis is invited to Thanksgiving dinner. While alone in the kitchen, Alma confronts Ennis about Jack. The two spar, causing Ennis to storm out and cease contact with Alma. Ennis has a brief romantic relationship with Cassie, a waitress. Jack and Lureen befriend Randall and Lashawn Malone, and it is implied that Jack and Randall have a brief affair. At the end of a tryst disguised as a fishing trip, Ennis says he cannot see Jack again for months due to work demands. The pair argue, before Jack embraces a crying Ennis. A postcard Ennis sent Jack is returned stamped with Deceased. Ennis calls Jack\\'s phone number. Lureen answers and says Jack died when a car tire exploded in his face. While hearing what happened, Ennis envisions men fatally beating Jack with a tire iron. Lureen says Jack requested his ashes be scattered on Brokeback Mountain. Ennis visits Jack\\'s parents hoping to carry out his wish. Jack\\'s father declares that Jack\\'s ashes will be interred in a family plot. Jack\\'s mother allows Ennis to visit Jack\\'s bedroom. He finds the shirt Jack thought he left on the mountain, which Jack had secretly kept, nested inside one of his own shirts. Ennis embraces the shirts and silently weeps. Jack\\'s mother enters and sees him holding the two shirts, and allows him to keep them. Later, 19-year-old Alma Jr. arrives at Ennis\\'s trailer to announce her engagement to Kurt, who works in the oil fields. She asks for her father\\'s blessing and invites him to the wedding. Ennis hesitates to come due to upcoming work commitments, then agrees to attend the wedding. Once Alma Jr. leaves, Ennis goes to the closet where the two shirts hang, Jack\\'s shirt now inside Ennis\\'s. Next to them, tacked to the closet door, is a postcard of Brokeback Mountain. With tears in his eyes, he stares at the mementos, and says, Jack, I swear...",

            "plot": "Trevor Reznik is a machinist whose insomnia has led to him becoming emaciated. His appearance and behavior keep his coworkers away, and they eventually turn against him when he is involved in an accident, which causes his coworker, Miller, to lose his left arm. Trevor, who was distracted by an unfamiliar coworker named Ivan, is blamed for the accident. No one at the factory knows of Ivan and there are no records of him. Trevor seems to find comfort in the arms of Stevie, a prostitute with genuine affection for him, and with Maria, a waitress at an airport diner he frequents. He is haunted by brief flashes of recurring imagery, and things such as his car cigarette lighter take on a menacing air. A mysterious series of post-it notes appears on his refrigerator, depicting a game of hangman. These vague incidents send him further into paranoia, but he nonetheless attempts to establish a relationship with Maria. Meeting her at an amusement park, Trevor goes with her son Nicholas on a dark ride called Route 666. The ride starts as a harmless scare ride, but begins to show increasingly disturbing images as it advances, until its flashing lights cause Nicholas to suffer an epileptic seizure. No longer able to think clearly, Trevor suspects that the bizarre events are a concerted effort to drive him insane, as do recurring clues such as a photo of Ivan fishing with Trevors coworker Reynolds, which he discovers in Ivans wallet when Ivan leaves it unattended in a pub. Another near-accident at work causes Trevor to lash out in rage at his coworkers; as a result, he is immediately fired. Increasingly distracted and alienated, Trevor forgets to pay his utility bills and his electricity is disconnected. A dark, viscous liquid begins trickling out of the freezer, coating the refrigerator door with streaks of what appears to be blood. After several attempts to confront Ivan, Trevor tries to trace his license plate, but runs out of gas while in pursuit of his car. When a DMV clerk insists that personal information cannot be released unless a crime has been committed, Trevor throws himself in front of a car in order to accuse Ivan of committing a hit and run. He files a police report with Ivans plate number, only to be baffled when he is told that the car in question is his own, and that he had reported it totaled one year ago. He flees the police and goes to Stevie, who bathes and clothes him, but he is disturbed by the discovery of the photo of Ivan and Reynolds framed in her home. Trevor accuses her of conspiring against him. Confused, Stevie says the picture is of Reynolds and Trevor, but he refuses to look at it, and after a violent argument, Stevie throws him out. He goes to the airport diner, but is told by an unfamiliar waitress that theyve never had an employee named Maria. The waitress at the counter tells Trevor she has served him every day for a year, and, in all that time, he spoke so little that she thought he was mute. Trevor sees Ivan take Nicholas into Trevors apartment and, fearing the worst, sneaks inside. Nicholas is nowhere to be seen and doesnt respond to Trevors calls. Trevor confronts Ivan in the bathroom, and Ivan tells him you know hes dead. Trevor, believing Ivan has killed Nicholas and his body is in the bathtub, attacks and seemingly kills him. He pulls back the shower curtain, only to find the bathtub empty. He goes to the refrigerator and opens it to find rotting fish, matching those in the fishing photo, which he at last realizes was of himself with Reynolds, just as Stevie claimed; Trevor hallucinated Ivans presence in the photo. Trevor takes a rolled-up carpet containing Ivans body to the ocean to dispose of it, only for the rug to unroll as he does so and reveal nothing inside. Ivan, unharmed, approaches Trevor from behind, and laughs as he tells Trevor that he has some explaining to do. Trevor stares into a mirror at home, repeating the words, I know who you are. He remembers that one year prior, a then-healthy Trevor ran over and killed a boy identical to Nicholas after taking his eyes off the road to use the cars cigarette lighter, which was witnessed by the boys mother identical to Maria. Trevor fled the scene in his car, and the resulting guilt became the root of his insomnia, emaciation and repressed memories. Ivan was a figment of Trevors imagination and a manifestation of his guilt. He fills the missing letters on the hangman note, spelling out killer. The next day, he puts all his personal items in boxes meant to be donated, as he tells his landlord. He briefly considers going to the airport to escape, but instead drives to police headquarters. He is accompanied by a silent but encouraging Ivan, who bids him an approving farewell outside the station as he enters and confesses to the hit-and-run. Two police officers escort Trevor to a cell, where after stating that he only wants to sleep, he does, for the first time in a year.",

Bagley asks him to train the newly created Imperial Japanese Army for a Japanese businessman, Omura, who intends to use the army to suppress a samurai-headed rebellion against Japan\\'s new emperor. Despite his hatred of Bagley, the impoverished Algren takes the job for the money. He is accompanied to Japan by his old friend, Sergeant Zebulon Gant.

As Algren trains them to shoot, news arrives of a samurai attack on one of Omura\\'s railroads. Against Algren\\'s wishes, Omura sends the soldiers in pursuit of the samurai. The battle turns into a disaster as the recruits are quickly routed and flee, and Gant is killed. Algren fights to the last before he is surrounded; wounded and expecting to die, he is taken prisoner when samurai leader Katsumoto spares him.Algren is taken to Katsumoto\\'s village and, at Katsumoto\\'s request, is taken in and tended to by Taka, Katsumoto\\'s sister, who Algren later realizes is the widow of a samurai he killed before being taken prisoner. While he is poorly treated at first, he eventually gains the samurai\\'s respect and grows close to Katsumoto. With the help of Taka, Algren overcomes his alcoholism and guilt, learns the Japanese language and culture, and is trained in the art of kenjutsu. He develops sympathy for the samurai, who are upset that the pace of modern technology has eroded the traditions of their society. Algren and Taka develop an unspoken affection for each other.One night, a group of ninja infiltrate the village and ambush Katsumoto. Algren saves Katsumoto\\'s life, and then helps defend the village, concluding that Omura is responsible. Katsumoto requests a meeting with Emperor Meiji in Tokyo. He brings Algren, intending to release him. Upon arriving in Tokyo, Algren sees that the Imperial Army has become a well-trained and fully equipped force led by Bagley. Katsumoto, to his dismay, discovers that the young and inexperienced emperor has become a puppet of Omura. At a government meeting, Omura orders Katsumoto\\'s arrest for carrying a sword in public and tells him to perform seppuku the next day to redeem his honor. Meanwhile, Algren refuses Omura\\'s offer to resume command of the army. After defeating Imperial agents sent by Omura to assassinate him, Algren enlists Graham and Katsumoto\\'s men to free their leader. During the rescue, Katsumoto\\'s son Nobutada is mortally wounded, his sacrifice allowing the others to escape.As the Imperial Army marches to crush the rebellion, a grieving Katsumoto contemplates seppuku. Algren convinces him to fight, and pledges to join the samurai in battle. They arrive back at the village, and Algren is reunited with Taka and her children. On the morning of the impending battle, Taka prepares Algren by carefully dressing him in her late husband\\'s samurai armor, and Katsumoto presents him with a newly-forged samurai sword engraved with an inscription dubbing Algren \"the warrior in which the old ways have joined the new.\"On the battlefield, Algren and Katsumoto meet with Omura and Bagley for parley; Bagley offers terms of surrender to Katsumoto, which he refuses. The samurai use the Imperial Army\\'s overconfidence to lure them into a trap; the ensuing battle inflicts massive casualties on both sides and forces the imperial soldiers to retreat. Knowing that imperial reinforcements are coming, and defeat is inevitable, Katsumoto orders a suicidal cavalry charge on horseback. The samurai withstand an artillery barrage and break through Bagley\\'s line. Algren kills Bagley, but the samurai are quickly mowed down by Gatling guns. The imperial captain, previously trained by Algren and horrified by the sight of the dying samurai, orders the soldiers to cease fire, outraging Omura. Katsumoto, mortally wounded, commits seppuku with Algren\\'s help as the soldiers kneel in respect.Later, as trade negotiations conclude, the injured Algren interrupts the proceedings. He presents the emperor with Katsumoto\\'s sword and asks him to remember the traditions for which Katsumoto and his fellow samurai fought and died. The emperor realizes that while Japan should modernize, it can\\'t forget its own culture and history. He rejects the trade offer, and when Omura protests, the emperor tells him he has done enough and threatens to seize his fortune and distribute it to the people. Omura angrily protests, but when the emperor tells him to commit seppuku to prove his disgrace, he shrinks away in humiliation. After Omura accepts defeat, the emperor asks Algren how Katsumoto died, to which Algren responds that he will instead tell the emperor how he lived.While various rumors regarding Algren\\'s fate circulate, Graham concludes that Algren had returned to the village to reunite with Taka.",

            "plot": "In Ireland, 1964, so-called fallen women are considered sinners who needed to be redeemed. Four young women \u2013 Margaret (raped by her cousin), Bernadette (too beautiful and coquettish), Rose (an unmarried mother) and Crispina (an intellectually disabled unmarried mother) \u2013 are forced by their families or caretakers into the Magdalene asylum. The film details the disastrous lives of the four girls whilst they are inmates, portraying their harsh daily regimen and their squalid living conditions at the laundries. Each woman suffers horrific cruelty and violence from the Mother Superior. Sister Bridget, despite her gentle-faced appearance and outwardly soft-spoken demeanour, is characterised as sadistic and almost inhuman at times, as conveyed through her merciless beating of Rose in full view of Bernadette, or when having shaved Unas head following an escape attempt, she mockingly laughs as Una hopelessly clutches at her fallen hair locks. Sister Bridget relishes the money the business receives and it is suggested that little of it is distributed appropriately. Those who liken themselves to Mary Magdalene, who deprived herself of all pleasures of the flesh including food and drink, eat hearty breakfasts of buttered toast and bacon while the working women subsist on oatmeal porridge. In one particularly humiliating scene, the women are forced to stand naked in a line after taking a communal shower. The nuns then hold a contest on who has the most pubic hair, biggest bottom, biggest breasts and smallest breasts. The corruption of the resident priest, Father Fitzroy, is made very clear through his sexual abuse of Crispina. However, as the years pass, automatic washing machines start to appear, a modern household appliance whose growing ubiquity would eventually fatally undermine the economic viability of commercial laundries and make the Magdalene asylums unsustainable. Three of the girls are shown, to some extent, to triumph over their situation and their captors. Margaret, although she is allowed to leave by the intervention of her younger brother, does not leave the asylum without leaving her mark. When she deliberately asks Sister Bridget to step aside for her to freely pass and is sharply shot down, Margaret falls to her knees in prayer. The Mother Superior is so surprised, she only moves past her after the Bishop tells her to come along. Bernadette and Rose finally decide to escape together, trashing Sister Bridgets study in search for the key to the asylum door and engaging her in a suspenseful confrontation. The two girls escape her clutches and are helped to return to the real world by a sympathetic relative, their story optimistically ending when Rose boards a coach bound for the ferry to Liverpool and Bernadette becomes an apprentice hairdresser. Crispinas end, however, is not a happy one; she spends the rest of her days in a mental institution where she was sent to silence her from revealing the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of Father Fitzroy and dies of anorexia at the age of 24. The films script is fictional, but based on four testimonies reported in the documentary Sex in a Cold Climate.",

            "plot": "In 1993, Sam Dawson, a barista with an intellectual disability, and largely based on Benjamin Schwab, becomes the single father of Lucy Diamond Dawson, named after the Beatles song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, following her abandonment by her mother, a homeless woman with whom Sam had a sexual encounter. Sam is well-adjusted and has a supportive group of friends with disabilities as well as a kind, agoraphobic neighbor, Annie, who takes care of Lucy when Sam cannot. Nearly seven years later in 2001, Sam provides a loving place for precocious Lucy, though she soon surpasses his mental capacity and ability. Other children bully her for having an intellectually disabled father, and she becomes too embarrassed to accept that she is more advanced than he is. In danger of losing child custody, Sam gets advice from his friends and also hires a lawyer, Rita Harrison, whose absorption in her work and neglect of her son reveals her to also struggle with her role as a parent. In an attempt to prove that she is not cold, Rita agrees to take on Sams case pro bono. As they work to secure Sams rights, Sam helps Rita see her own life anew. This includes encouraging her to leave her philandering husband and repair her fractious relationship with her son. At the trial, due to pressure from the prosecutor, Sam breaks down after becoming convinced he is not capable of raising Lucy. Afterward, she resides in a foster home with Miranda Randy Carpenter but tries to convince Sam to help her run away. Sam moves so he is near Lucy, so she continually leaves in the middle of the night to go to his apartment, though he immediately returns her. The foster parents, though, decide not to adopt her as they had planned, and return her to Sam. Randy assures him that she will tell the judge he is the best parent for Lucy. In turn, Sam asks Randy if she will help him raise Lucy because he feels she needs a mother figure. The final scene depicts a soccer game, in which Sam referees and Lucy participates as a player. In attendance are Lucys former foster family, Sams friend group, and a newly single Rita with her son.",

            "plot": "Michael Sullivan, Sr. was orphaned and then raised by boss John Rooney in Rock Island, Illinois; unbeknownst to his own children, Sullivan is now Rooney's most fearsome enforcer. Rooney has come to love Sullivan more than he loves his own biological son, the rash and unpredictable Connor.Speaking in 1931 at his brother's wake, Rooney's associate Finn McGovern insinuates that Rooney is responsible for his brother's death. Rooney sends Connor and Sullivan to talk with McGovern. Sullivan's older son, twelve-year-old Michael Jr., watches the interaction through a hole in the wall. McGovern denies that his brother stole anything from the mob and implies that Connor was responsible. Connor shoots McGovern, forcing Sullivan to shoot the other armed witnesses in self-defense. Sullivan learns that Michael saw the shootout and swears him to secrecy.Rooney sends Sullivan to collect a debt from Tony Calvino. Connor, jealous and afraid, sends a letter with Sullivan for Calvino. Calvino reads the letter and reaches for his revolver, but Sullivan kills both Calvino and his bodyguard. The letter reads, Kill Sullivan and all debts are paid. Sullivan rushes home. When Sullivan arrives, he discovers that Connor has already murdered his wife, Annie, and their younger son, Peter. Michael was unharmed, as he had arrived home late from detention.Sullivan and Michael flee Rock Island and head to Chicago to meet mobster Frank Nitti. Sullivan offers to work for the Chicago Outfit in exchange for permission to kill Connor. Nitti rejects his offer and advises Sullivan against seeking revenge. Rooney, listening next door with Connor, reluctantly allows Nitti to dispatch freelance killer Harlen Maguire to kill Sullivan. Maguire tracks the Sullivans to a roadside diner. Maguire and Sullivan converse seemingly casually while Michael stays in the car. Sensing the danger, Sullivan escapes the diner through the bathroom window and slashes Maguire's tires before driving away.Sullivan begins robbing the banks that hold the Outfit's money; in so doing, Sullivan hopes to pressure the Outfit into withdrawing their protection from Connor. Sullivan teaches Michael to drive so that he can act as a getaway driver. The mob withdraws money from its banks, frustrating Sullivan's plan. Sullivan visits Rooney's accountant, Alexander Rance. Rance stalls Sullivan until Maguire enters with a shotgun. Rance is killed in the crossfire before Sullivan wounds Maguire and escapes with Rooney's ledgers. During the escape, Maguire shoots Sullivan in the shoulder. Michael drives them to a farm after Sullivan collapses from his wound, and an elderly childless husband and wife at the farm help him recover.The ledgers reveal that Connor has been embezzling from his father. Believing that Rooney will call off the hit on him if he knows the truth, Sullivan heads back to Chicago. Sullivan confronts Rooney at Mass and discovers that Rooney already knows Connor has been robbing him. Rooney states that he expects that Connor will either be killed by Sullivan or be killed by Nitti's men after Rooney has died. Nevertheless, Rooney refuses to give up his son. Rooney urges Sullivan to flee with Michael and raise him to be a better man than either of them is. Sullivan later ambushes and kills Rooney's bodyguards and then Rooney himself. Nitti reveals Connor's location after Sullivan promises that the feud will end with Connor's death. Sullivan goes to the hotel where Connor is hiding and kills him.Sullivan takes Michael to his aunt's beach house in Perdition. Once there, Sullivan is ambushed and shot by Maguire inside the house as Michael stands on the beach. Michael appears and points a gun at Maguire, and Sullivan fatally shoots Maguire in the back. Michael tells his father that he could not pull the trigger, and Sullivan nods and smiles as he dies in his son's arms.Michael drives the car back to the elderly couple's farm. In a voiceover, Michael says that he grew up there. Michael adds that he has not held a gun since his father's death. Michael states that when he is asked if his father was a good man, he simply answers, He was my father.",

            "plot": "While reading a newspaper advertisement, taxi driver Tarek Fahd discovers an invitation to participate in an experiment, in which 4,000 German marks are offered to the participants of a simulation of a prison situation. The experiment is led by Professor Klaus Thon and his assistant, Dr. Jutta Grimm. He decides to join in. Tarek participates as a journalist while wearing a pair of glasses with a built-in mini-camera. After a car accident he suffers shortly before the experiment, Tarek meets a woman called Dora. She spends the night with him and Tarek keeps thinking of her, shown in flashbacks. The 20 volunteers are pronounced guards and prisoners, 12 prisoners and 8 guards, and are being observed by a team of scientists. In the experiment, the prisoners lose their civil rights and have to obey arbitrary rules, such as the obligation to completely finish their meals. The guards are given nightsticks, but are told not to use violence in any case. Each prisoner\\'s name is taken away and replaced by a number. Tarek prisoner number 77 initially refuses to acknowledge the guards\\' superiority by drinking the milk of one of his co-prisoners because of that prisoner\\'s lactose intolerance, or by throwing his blanket out of his cell to provoke the guards. He befriends his cellmates Steinhoff and Sch\u00fctte. Psychological changes develop and the situation deteriorates. The circumstances seem to be escalating after only a few days. It becomes clear that limits are not only being reached, but being surpassed when the guards kidnap Tarek from his cell late in the night, order him to strip fully naked, shave his head bald and urinate on him. The guards become excessively aware of their power and use the prisoners\\' fear to make them obedient. On both sides, one person is considered dominant. On the prisoners\\' side, this is Tarek, and on the guards\\' side, it is the quiet guard Berus, a sadist, whose motto during the experiment is: Humiliation is the only way we can solve these troubles. From that moment on, the guards start to use more and more violence against the prisoners. The scientists engage in a discussion whether or not to abort the experiment. Dr. Grimm suggests putting an end to the alarming situation, but Professor Thon refuses to stop the experiment until the violence has reached a maximum. Dora meanwhile returns to Tarek\\'s apartment and discovers his participation contract for the experiment. She surprises him by showing up for a visit day. Tarek, who was forced to clean the toilet with his own clothes, pleads to the friendly guard Walther Bosch to secretly bring her a message. Berus intercepts Bosch, however, and tells Dora that everything is all right and refuses to let Tarek see Dora. The situation becomes critical and more violence is involved. The prisoners are being abused and their self-esteem is drastically decreased by the guards\\' power. Most of the violence is directed against Tarek and he is locked up in solitary confinement inside a black box resembling a safe. Sch\u00fctte, protesting this, is beaten severely, bound and gagged with duct tape and forced to sit on a chair. Later he suffocates to death due to his bloody nose drying up while gagged. Bosch is beaten by the other guards for his betrayal and is put into confinement. Lars, a member of Thon\\'s team, notices this and attempts to contact Professor Thon, who is attending a conference. The guards, who are aware that the professor cannot be reached by phone, are convinced by Berus that the entire situation is a test put up by Thon\\'s team, in order to make the guards handle an exceptional situation. They take over control of the facility and capture Lars, Dr. Grimm and the other scientists, who are put into confinement as well, and gradually start their own prison in which they engage in brutally sadistic games with total control. Dora comes to the facility a second time to speak to Tarek and is lured into a room by Berus, where he locks her up. Dr. Grimm is handcuffed and gagged with duct tape while the guard Eckert attempts to rape her. He is stopped by Tarek, who escaped from solitary confinement through the use of a screwdriver that he found inside the black box. Tarek knocks down Eckert and frees Lars, Bosch, Steinhoff, Dr. Grimm and the other prisoners. They manage to escape by removing the wall paneling of one of the cells with the screwdriver. Meanwhile, Professor Thon hears Lars\\' desperate message in his voicemail and leaves for the facility. Meanwhile, Steinhoff and Tarek stay behind in order to prevent Berus from coming after them. Professor Thon reaches the facility and demands an explanation from Eckert, who accidentally injures him with a pistol. The fleeing prisoners are ambushed by the guards and trapped. Bosch, who could not keep up with the others, loses his sanity and kills Eckert with a fire extinguisher. Dora then escapes the room she was locked up in, and steals Eckert\\'s gun. She injures one of the guards while he is engaged in fighting Tarek and Steinhoff, leaving only Berus to fight them. Tarek incapacitates Berus, who is nearly choked to death by Steinhoff until Tarek convinces him not to kill Berus. The film ends with a news break, confirming two deaths Sch\u00fctte and Eckert and three severely injured Thon, Berus, and Bosch. Both Berus and Thon will be put on trial, Berus for multiple homicides and torture with rape, and Thon for allowing an illegal and unethical experiment. In last scene Dora and Tarek are sitting together happily on the beach.",

            "plot": "In 1984, Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old from the fictional Everington in County Durham, England, loves to dance and has hopes of becoming a professional ballet dancer. Billy lives with his widowed father, Jackie, and older brother, Tony, both coal miners out on strike the latter being the union delegate. His maternal grandmother lives with them; she has Alzheimers disease and had once aspired to be a professional dancer. Billy\\'s father sends him to the gym to learn boxing, but Billy dislikes the sport. He happens to see a ballet class that is using the gym while their usual basement studio is being used temporarily as a soup kitchen for the striking miners. Unbeknownst to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet classes. But, passionate about dancing, he secretly continues his lessons with the help of his dance teacher, Sandra Wilkinson. Sandra believes that Billy is talented enough to study at the Royal Ballet School in London, but due to Tony\\'s arrest during a clash between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Sandra tells Jackie about the missed opportunity but, fearing that Billy will be considered to be gay, both Jackie and Tony are outraged at the prospect of him becoming a professional ballet dancer. Over Christmas, Billy learns his best friend, Michael, is gay. Billy is supportive of his friend. Later, Jackie catches Billy and Michael dancing in the gym, and realizes his son is truly gifted. Although stunned at first, he resolves to do whatever it takes to help Billy attain his dream. Sandra tries to persuade Jackie to let her pay for the audition, but he replies that Billy is his son and he does not need charity. Jackie attempts to cross the picket line to pay for the trip to London, but Tony stops him. Instead, his fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise some money, and Jackie pawns Billy\\'s mother\\'s jewellery to cover the cost, and Jackie takes him to London to audition. Although very nervous, Billy performs well. He punches another boy in frustration at the audition, and fears that he has ruined his chances. He is rebuked by the review board and, when asked what it feels like when he is dancing, struggles for words. He says that it is like electricity. Seemingly rejected, Billy returns home with his father. Sometime later, the Royal Ballet School sends him a letter of acceptance, coinciding with the end of the miners\\' strike, and Billy leaves home to study in London. In 1998, 25-year-old Billy performs as the Swan in Matthew Bourne\\'s Swan Lake with Jackie, Tony, and Michael watching from the audience. As Billy takes the stage, his father is overcome with emotion while the other dancers watch from the wings.",

            "plot": "Professional thief Danny Ocean is released after four years in a New Jersey prison. He travels to Los Angeles and reunites with friend and colleague Rusty Ryan. They travel to Las Vegas to secure financial backing from wealthy friend Reuben Tishkoff for a multi-million dollar heist to rob three casinos owned by Tishkoffs ruthless rival, Terry Benedict. These are the Bellagio, the Mirage, and the MGM Grand. Legally required to have enough cash to cover all casino patrons bets, Danny estimates that during an upcoming high-profile boxing match, the casinos will hold over 150 million in an underground vault guarded by virtually unassailable security measures and systems. Having been forced out of his casino by Benedict, Tishkoff readily agrees to participate. Danny and Rusty recruit eight accomplices: con man Frank Catton, retired con man Saul Bloom, auto specialists Virgil and Turk Malloy, explosives expert Basher Tarr, surveillance technician Livingston Dell, acrobat Yen, and pickpocket Linus Caldwell. A precise replica of the vault is built to practice the heist, and team members are assigned to infiltrate or surveil the Bellagio to assess the security, staff routines, and the buildings layout. Linus, tasked with tracking Benedict, discovers he is dating Dannys ex-wife, Tess. Believing Dannys motive is driven by wanting to reunite with Tess, Rusty wants to call off the heist, but Danny refuses. Danny later meets with Tess, who is still hurting by their failed relationship, and also Benedict, who has Danny barred from his casinos. The team commence the heist while Danny enters the Bellagio. Benedict has him detained in a surveillance-free room to be beaten by Bruiser, who secretly works with Danny. Danny reaches the vault elevator through the vent and meets up with Linus, who has infiltrated the casino as a state gaming official. Meanwhile, Saul, disguised as a wealthy foreigner, persuades Benedict to secure a briefcase containing jewelsactually disguised explosivesin the casino vault. Virgil and Turk smuggle Yen into the vault in a casino trolley. Basher triggers a stolen EMP device which disables electricity across Las Vegas, including the laser grid protecting the elevator shaft, allowing Danny and Linus to descend to the vault entrance. The pair neutralize the guards and, with Yen, use Sauls explosive jewels to destroy the vault locks and secure the cash. Rusty calls Benedict and reveals the robbery, blackmailing him to surrender half the cash to a van waiting outside or else all the money will be blown up. Verifying the compromised vault by camera, Benedict complies, but has his men pursue the van while summoning a SWAT team to retake the vault. During the SWAT teams assault the explosives are detonated, destroying the remaining half of the cash while the thieves seemingly escape. Meanwhile, the van is discovered to be under remote control and the money bags filled with paper advertisements. Benedict dismisses the SWAT team before realizing that the video footage was faked because the Bellagio logo was not on the vaults floor; the footage was the teams replica vault. It is revealed that, after intercepting the 911 call, the team entered the casino disguised as SWAT members and left the vault with duffel bags containing over 160 million in cash. Danny returns to the secure room before Benedict arrives to confront him. Tess receives a call telling her to watch her TV which shows a surveillance camera feed of Danny tricking Benedict into admitting that he would give up Tess in exchange for the moneys return. Unable to connect Danny to the heist, Benedict instead gets him arrested for parole violation; Danny and Tess reconcile before he is taken away. As dawn breaks, the remaining team contemplate their victory before going their separate ways. Several months later, Danny is released from prison and picked up by Rusty and Tess. They drive off, knowingly followed by Benedicts men.",

            "plot": "Jake Hoyt, an ambitious LAPD police officer, is assigned to work with Detective Alonzo Harris, a highly decorated narcotics officer, for a one-day evaluation ahead of Hoyts anticipated promotion. Driving around in Alonzos Monte Carlo, they begin the day by catching some college kids buying marijuana. Alonzo confiscates the drugs, puts them into a pipe and tells Jake to smoke it. When Jake refuses, Alonzo threatens him at gunpoint, stating that such a refusal while on the streets would get him killed. Jake smokes the pipe and gets very high. Alonzo laughs, disclosing that it was laced with PCP. After paying a visit to Roger, an ex-cop turned drug dealer, Jake notices a pair of addicts attempting to rape Letty, a teenage girl in an alley. Jake intervenes while Alonzo watches him get attacked and fight the rapists. After Letty leaves, Alonzo menaces the rapists, but declines to arrest them and Jake collects Lettys wallet from the ground. Later, Alonzo and Jake apprehend a dealer named Blue, who has crack rocks - revealed when Alonzo makes Blue vomit by sticking a pen down his throat, which fazes Jake - and a loaded handgun in his possession. Rather than go to jail, Blue informs on his employer Kevin Sandman Miller, who is in prison. Using a fake search warrant, Alonzo steals 40,000 from Sandmans home. At lunch, the two visit Alonzos mistress Sara and their young son. Alonzo then meets with a trio of corrupt high-ranking police officials he dubs the Three Wise Men. Aware that the Russian mafia is hunting Alonzo, they suggest he skip town. Alonzo insists he has control of the situation and trades the 40,000 for an arrest warrant. Alonzo assembles his squad of narcotics officers, and with Jake in tow they return to Rogers house and use the warrant to seize 4 million, a quarter of which Alonzo keeps and shares with his squad. Jake refuses to take a share of the money, worrying Alonzo and the other officers. Alonzo executes Roger after Jake refuses his order to do so, staging the scene with his men to make the shooting look justified. Infuriated, Jake gets into a standoff with the corrupt officers. Alonzo reveals he orchestrated the days events to have leverage over Jake and threatens him with the police departments post-incident blood test, which will catch the PCP Jake smoked and end his career. Alonzo promises to protect Jake from the drug test in exchange for his cooperation and Jake begrudgingly complies. Later that evening, Alonzo drives Jake to the home of a Sureno gangster named Smiley for an errand. As he waits for Alonzo, Jake reluctantly plays poker with Smiley and his fellow gang members, Sniper and Moreno. Smiley then explains Alonzos situation: by midnight, Alonzo must pay 1 million to the Russians for killing one of their men over an insult in Las Vegas or be killed himself. Additionally, Smiley reveals Alonzo has abandoned Jake and paid Smiley to kill him. Jake attempts to flee but is beaten and dragged to the bathroom to be executed. Moreno searches Jake for money and finds the wallet of Letty, who happens to be Smileys cousin. After calling Letty and confirming that Jake saved her, Smiley releases Jake out of gratitude. An infuriated Jake returns to Saras apartment to arrest Alonzo before he leaves to pay the Russians with Rogers money. A gunfight and chase ensue, and Alonzo is eventually subdued on the street while the entire neighborhood gathers to watch. Alonzo offers money to whoever kills Jaketo no avail. Jake takes the stolen cash to submit as evidence against Alonzo and the neighborhood gang allows him to leave safely. An enraged Alonzo, realizing his plan has been foiled, suffers a mental breakdown and threatens retaliation against the neighborhood, but they ignore him and walk away during his rant. Alonzo flees for the Los Angeles International Airport but is ambushed and gunned down by the Russians. Jake returns home as the press reports on Alonzos death.",

            "plot": "Craig Schwartz is an unemployed puppeteer in New York City, in a forlorn marriage with his pet-obsessed wife, Lotte. He finds work as a file clerk for the eccentric Dr. Lester in the Mertin-Flemmer building, on a floor between the 7th and 8th, where the ceiling is very low. He develops an attraction to co-worker Maxine Lund, who does not return his affections. While filing, Craig accidentally discovers a small hidden door. He crawls through it into a tunnel and finds himself inside the mind of actor John Malkovich. After 15 minutes, Craig is ejected, landing on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. He tells Maxine about the door, and she realizes they can sell the experience for profit. Lotte enters the portal, and based on her experience being John Malkovich, she becomes fascinated with the idea of becoming a man. She and Craig visit Dr. Lester\\'s home, where Lotte finds a room filled with Malkovich memorabilia. Maxine arranges a date with Malkovich while he is inhabited by Lotte, who becomes smitten with Maxine. She reciprocates, but only when Lotte is inside Malkovich; Maxine manipulates him into having sex with her while Lotte is in his mind. Craig, forsaken by both women, locks Lotte in a cage and forces her to set up another tryst with Maxine. He inhabits Malkovich instead and discovers that his puppeteering skills allow him some control over Malkovich. Meanwhile, the real Malkovich, disturbed by his loss of control, confides in his friend Charlie Sheen and becomes suspicious of Maxine. Malkovich follows her to the office, where she and Craig are charging customers to use the portal. When Malkovich enters it himself, he finds himself in a world where everyone looks like him and says only Malkovich. After he is ejected, he demands that Craig close the portal, but Craig refuses. Lotte is freed by her pet chimpanzee and warns Maxine that Craig is inhabiting Malkovich, but Maxine is attracted to Craig\\'s ability to control him. Lotte confronts Dr. Lester, who reveals that he is, in fact, Captain Mertin, who, having discovered the portal to a vessel body in the late 1800s, erected the Mertin-Flemmer building to conceal it. He has obtained immortality by moving from one body to the next, which becomes ripe on the host\\'s 44th birthday, allowing him to take possession. If he were to enter the portal past midnight on that day, he would instead be trapped in the next newborn vessel, helpless inside the new host\\'s mind. This time, Lester has invited a group of friends to join him in occupying Malkovich once he turns 44, and Lotte warns them that Craig has taken control. Craig discovers he can occupy Malkovich indefinitely. Inhabiting him over the next eight months, he makes Malkovich into a world-class puppeteer and marries Maxine. Later, Maxine discovers that she is pregnant. On Malkovich\\'s 44th birthday, Lester and Lotte kidnap Maxine. They call to demand that Craig leave Malkovich, threatening to kill Maxine, but he hangs up. In desperation, Lotte decides to shoot Maxine, who escapes into the portal. Lotte pursues her through Malkovich\\'s subconscious before they are both ejected. Maxine confesses that she kept her unborn child because it was conceived while Lotte was in Malkovich\\'s mind, meaning that it is Lotte\\'s child, too, and the women cement their love for each other. Craig, believing Maxine is still in danger, leaves Malkovich\\'s mind, allowing Lester and his friends to enter. Discovering that Maxine has discarded him for Lotte, Craig swears to reenter the portal to take back Malkovich\\'s mind. Seven years later, an older Malkovich, now inhabited by multiple people, tells Sheen about Lester and his friends\\' plan to extend their lives via the portal, which now leads to the mind of Maxine\\'s daughter Emily. Craig, who entered the portal too late, is permanently trapped inside Emily, forced to watch Lotte and Maxine live happily together.",

            "plot": "Misanthropic New York City best-selling romance novelist Melvin Udall has obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder OCD. He uses soap bars only once to wash his hands, uses paper towels to touch public restroom faucets and door handles, avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks, has rituals with switches and locks, and sticks to rigid routines. Melvin always eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant while bringing his own plastic flatware. Carol Connelly is the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his odd and rude behavior. Melvin\\'s apartment neighbor, gay artist Simon Bishop, starts working with a new model, Vincent Lopiano. Vincent uses the opportunity to case Simon\\'s apartment and give entry to his friends, who assault and nearly kill Simon during the robbery. Simon\\'s agent, Frank Sachs, intimidates Melvin into caring for Simon\\'s beautiful Griffon Bruxellois pet dog, Verdell, while Simon is hospitalized. Although Melvin initially does not enjoy caring for the dog, he becomes emotionally attached to it. When Simon is released from the hospital, Melvin tolerates a neighborly relationship with Simon so he can continue to see Verdell. Melvin\\'s OCD need for routine and aversion to change is aggravated when Carol decides to work closer to her home in Brooklyn to be more accessible for her acutely asthmatic son, Spencer. Unable to adjust to a different waitress, Melvin arranges to pay for Spencer\\'s considerable medical expenses for at-home care\u2015if Carol returns to the restaurant. While Carol is overwhelmed by Melvin\u2019s generosity, thanking him profusely, she is suspicious of his motives, declaring emphatically that she will never have sex with him. A humiliated Melvin admonishes her that she, not he, has made the situation personal. Meanwhile, Simon\u2019s injuries, lack of medical insurance, and high medical bills cause him to go bankrupt and fall into depression. Frank persuades him to go to Baltimore to ask his estranged parents for money. Bullied by Frank, Melvin reluctantly agrees to take recuperating Simon to Baltimore. Frank lends Melvin his Saab 900 convertible for the trip. Irrationally fearing Simon may make a pass at him his cover story, Melvin invites Carol along on the trip, reminding her that she owes him a favor, and she reluctantly accepts. Relationships develop among the three on the trip as Simon discusses the root of his estrangement with his parents, who cannot accept his homosexuality; Carol commiserates; and Melvin\u2019s acerbic remarks gradually become more sympathetic. Once in Baltimore, Carol persuades Melvin to take her out for dinner. Melvin\\'s conversation during the dinner initially flatters her\u2014he tells her that her \u201cno sex oath\u201d made him start taking medication to become a better man. When Carol presses Melvin to admit that he invited her on the trip because he had feelings for her, however, an embarrassed and fumbling Melvin again clumsily deflects, awkwardly responding that he invited her along to maybe have sex with Simon to cure his homosexuality. Upset at the implication that her sexual favors are for sale, Carol abruptly leaves. She goes to Simon\u2019s hotel room for consolation, and their emotional intimacy rekindles his creative desire to paint. He sketches Carol, nearly nude, making her feel her femininity appreciated in a nonsexual way. With confidence inspired by Carol, Simon briefly reconnects with his mother, without asking her for money, telling her that he will be fine. After returning to New York, Carol tells Melvin that he disparages her and she does not want him in her life anymore. Since Simon is still broke and his apartment has been sublet, Melvin arranges for Simon to stay in his spare bedroom. On learning of Melvin\u2019s enormous gesture and sign of growth, Carol regrets her harshness and calls Melvin to apologize. The relationship between Melvin and Carol remains complicated until Simon persuades Melvin to declare his love for her. Melvin goes to see Carol, who hesitantly agrees to try and establish a relationship with him. She is encouraged by her mother, who declares that no relationship is perfect. The film ends with Melvin and Carol walking together. As he opens the door at an early morning pastry shop for Carol, he realizes that he has stepped on a crack in the pavement, but does not seem to mind.",

            "plot": "In 1914, aliens known as Mondoshawans meet their contact on Earth, a priest of a secret order, at an ancient Egyptian temple. They take the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil that appears every five thousand years, promising to protect it and return it before the great evils re-emergence. The weapon consists of the four classical elements, as four engraved stones, plus a sarcophagus containing a fifth element. In the 23rd century, the great evil appears in deep space as a giant living fireball. It destroys an armed Earth spaceship as it heads to Earth. The Mondoshawans current human contact on Earth, priest Vito Cornelius, informs the President of the Federated Territories of the great evils history and the weapon that can stop it. On their way to Earth, a Mondoshawan spacecraft carrying the weapon is ambushed and destroyed by a crew of Mangalores, alien mercenaries hired by Earth industrialist Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, who is working for the great evil. A severed hand in metal armor from the wreckage of the spacecraft is brought to New York City. From this, the government uses biotechnology to recreate the original occupant of the sarcophagus, a humanoid woman named Leeloo, who remembers her previous life. Alarmed by the unfamiliar surroundings and high security, she escapes and jumps off a ledge, crashing into the flying taxicab of Korben Dallas, a former major in Earths Special Forces. Dallas delivers Leeloo to Cornelius and his apprentice, David, who recognizes her as the Fifth Element. As Leeloo recuperates, she tells Cornelius that the stones were not on board the Mondoshawan ship. Simultaneously, the Mondoshawans inform Earths government the stones were entrusted to an alien opera singer, the diva Plavalaguna. Zorg reneges on his deal with the Mangalores for failing to obtain the stones and kills some of them. Earths military sends Dallas to meet Plavalaguna; a rigged radio contest provides a cover, awarding Dallas a luxury vacation aboard a flying hotel on planet Fhloston, accompanied by flamboyant talk-show host Ruby Rhod. It includes a concert by Plavalaguna, and learning that Leeloo shares his mission, Dallas lets her accompany him. Cornelius instructs David to prepare the temple, then stows away on the luxury spaceship. The Mangalore crew, pursuing the stones for themselves, also illegally board the ship. During the concert, the Mangalores attack, and Plavalaguna is killed. Dallas extracts the stones from her body and kills the Mangalore leader, causing the others to surrender. Zorg arrives, shoots Leeloo, and activates a time bomb. He flees with a carrying case he presumes contains the stones but returns when he discovers it is empty. Dallas finds Leeloo traumatized and escapes with her, Cornelius, Rhod, and the stones in Zorgs private spaceship. Zorg deactivates his bomb, but a dying Mangalore sets off his own, destroying the hotel and killing Zorg. As the great evil approaches Earth, the four meet David at the temple. They deploy the stones, but Leeloo, having learned of humanitys history of cruelty, has given up on life. Dallas declares his love for her and kisses her. Leeloo combines the power of the stones, emitting divine light onto the great evil and defeating it. She and Dallas are hailed as heroes, and as dignitaries wait to greet them, the two passionately embrace in a recovery chamber.",

            "plot": "The film begins with a fleet of helicopters spraying for medflies, which brings various characters together along the flight path. Dr. Ralph Wyman and his wife, Marian, meet Stuart Kane, an unemployed salesman, and Claire Kane, a party clown, at a concert Zoe Trainer performs on cello. They impulsively decide to have a Sunday dinner date. Meanwhile, Marians sister, Sherri, is married to a cheating cop named Gene, who is having an affair with Betty Weathers, while Betty is divorcing one of the helicopter pilots, Stormy. Among the other characters are Doreen Piggot, a waitress married to an alcoholic limo driver named Earl, and television commentator Howard Finnigan, who lives next door to cabaret singer Tess and her daughter Zoe. Jerry Kaiser, the pool cleaner, is married to Lois, who works from home as a phone sex operator. Jerry and Lois are friends with Honey, Doreens daughter, and her husband Bill, a makeup artist. Tragedy strikes when Casey, Howard and Annes young son, is accidentally hit by Doreens car. Although he initially seems fine, Casey later falls unconscious at home. The concerned parents rush him to the hospital, where he remains comatose. In the midst of this, the baker Andy Bitkower repeatedly calls the Finnigans to inform them about their ordered cake. However, Howard, wanting to keep the phone line free, abruptly ends the calls, leading to frustration on Andys part. Howards estranged father, Paul, arrives at the hospital and recalls an incident from Howards childhood, which caused the rift between them. Meanwhile, Stuart and his friends, Gordon and Vern, harass Doreen at the diner before leaving for a fishing trip. During their excursion, they discover the body of a young woman. Contemplating what to do, they decide to tie her to the rocks and continue fishing, only reporting the incident later. Stuart eventually confesses to Claire, who is appalled by their actions and visits the funeral home out of guilt. Stormy, one of the helicopter pilots, pays a destructive visit to Bettys house while she is away with their son. Gene abandons the family dog due to its barking, but eventually retrieves it after his children express distress. The Wymans have a heated argument before their dinner party with the Kanes, during which Marian admits to having an affair. Both couples resort to heavy drinking, and the party lasts throughout the night. A glimmer of hope arises when Caseys eyes flutter, but tragically, he suddenly dies, leaving Howard and Anne devastated. Meanwhile, Zoe, overwhelmed by her mothers alcoholism, Caseys death, and her own isolation, commits suicide by starting her car engine inside the garage. Her mother discovers her lifeless body and drinks herself into a stupor. When Honey picks up pictures from the fotomat, she finds them mixed up with Gordons. Honey is shocked to find pictures of the submerged body from Gordons fishing trip while Gordon equally shocked to find pictures of Honey appearing severely beaten. Disturbed, they part ways but memorize each others license plates. Later, at a picnic, Jerry and Bill encounter two young women they had met earlier. Bill and one of the girls walk away, only to hear her scream moments before Jerry kills her with a rock. Suddenly, a major earthquake strikes, causing chaos. The aftermath suggests that Jerrys act may be mistakenly attributed to the falling rocks during the earthquake.",

            "plot": "Charles Dickens and his friend Rizzo narrate the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a greedy, grumpy, pennypinching and lonely moneylender of nineteenth century London, who in particular does not share the merriment of Christmas. On Christmas Eve he rejects his nephews Freds invitation to Christmas dinner, dismisses two gentlemen collecting money for charity, and tosses a wreath at a carol-singing Bean Bunny. His kind, humble employee Bob Cratchit and the other bookkeepers request to not work on Christmas Day, since there will be no business for Scrooge on the day, to which he reluctantly agrees. That night Scrooge encounters the shackled ghosts of his late business partners, Jacob and Robert Marley, in his bed chambers. They warn him to repent his wicked ways or be condemned to suffer in the afterlife as they do and that three spirits will visit him during the night. At one oclock Scrooge is visited by the childlike Ghost of Christmas Past, who shows him visions of his childhood and early adult life. Along with Dickens and Rizzo, they visit his lonely school days and then his time as an employee at Fozziwigs rubber chicken factory. There, at Fozziwigs Christmas party, Scrooge meets a young woman named Belle, with whom he falls in love but loses as he chooses money more over her. Seeing this, a tearful Scrooge tells the Ghost to leave him and is returned to his home. Scrooge next meets the gigantic, merry Ghost of Christmas Present, who shows him the joys and wonder of Christmas Day. Scrooge and the Ghost visit Freds house, where Scrooge is made fun of for his stinginess and general ill will toward all. Scrooge and the spirit then visit Bob Cratchits house, learning his family is content with the little they have. Scrooge also takes pity on Bobs ill son Tiny Tim, whom the Ghost comments will soon die if things continue the way they are. The Ghost leaves Scrooge with the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, who takes Scrooge into the future where a recent death elicits no sympathy from the inhabitants of London and the stolen possessions of the deceased are sold to a fence named Old Joe. The Ghost also shows Scrooge the Cratchits home, where they find Bob and his family mourning Tiny Tim. Scrooge is led to the cemetery, where the Ghost points out the neglected grave of the unloved man; Scrooge wipes the snow away on the tombstone to see it bears his own name. Scrooge tearfully vows to change his ways and suddenly finds himself back in his bedroom, where he discovers it is Christmas Day. Filled with glee, he begins spreading happiness and joy around London, agreeing to give money to the gentlemen\\'s charity and reconciling with Fred and Fozziwig. Scrooge has Bean buy the poulterers prized turkey and they, along with Dickens, Rizzo and the gentlemen, deliver it to Bobs family. Scrooge tells Bob he will raise his salary and pay off his mortgage, Dickens tells that Tiny Tim escaped death thanks to Scrooges new generosity, and everyone celebrates Christmas together.",

            "plot": "At the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, Private William Santiago, a United States Marine, is tied up and beaten in the middle of the night. After he is found dead, Lance Corporal Harold Dawson and Private First Class Louden Downey are accused of his murder and face a courtmartial. Their defense is assigned to United States Navy JAG Corps Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee, a callow lawyer with a penchant for plea bargains.Another JAG attorney, Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway, Kaffee\\'s superior, suspects something is amiss. Santiago died after he broke the chain of command to ask to be transferred away. Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson advocated for Santiago to be transferred, but Base Commander Colonel Nathan Jessep ordered Santiago\\'s platoon commander, Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick, to train Santiago on the basis they are all at fault for Santiago\\'s substandard performance. Galloway suspects that Dawson and Downey carried out a code red order: a violent extrajudicial punishment. Galloway is bothered by Kaffee\\'s blas\u00e9 approach, and Kaffee resents Galloway\\'s interference.Kaffee and Galloway question Jessep and others at Guantanamo Bay and are met with contempt from the colonel. When Kaffee negotiates a plea bargain with the prosecutor, US Marine Judge Advocate Captain Jack Ross, Dawson and Downey refuse, insisting that Kendrick gave them the code red order, that they never intended to kill Santiago, and that it would be dishonorable to pursue a plea bargain. Kaffee intends to get removed as counsel, but at the arraignment, Kaffee unexpectedly enters a plea of not guilty for the defendants. He says that he was chosen to handle the case because he was expected to accept a plea, and the matter would then be kept quiet.Markinson meets Kaffee in secret and says that Jessep never ordered a transfer for Santiago. The defense establishes that Dawson had been denied promotion for smuggling food to a Marine who had been sentenced to be deprived of food. Dawson is portrayed in a good light, and the defense, through Downey, proves that code reds had been ordered before. But under cross examination, Downey says that he was not present when Dawson received the supposed code red order. Markinson, ashamed that he failed to protect a Marine under his command and unwilling to testify against Jessep, his longtime friend, commits suicide before he can testify.Without Markinson\\'s testimony, Kaffee believes the case lost. He returns home in a drunken stupor, lamenting that he fought the case instead of taking a deal. Galloway encourages Kaffee to call Jessep as a witness, despite the risk of being courtmartialed for challenging a high ranking officer without evidence.At the Washington Navy Yard court, Jessep spars with Kaffee\\'s questioning, but is unnerved when Kaffee points out a contradiction in his testimony. Kaffee also calls into question Jessep\\'s claim that Santiago was to be put on the first flight home. Upon further questioning, and disgusted by Kaffee\\'s attitude, Jessep extols the military\\'s, and his own, importance to national security. Kaffee asks if Jessep ordered the code red, to which he bellows You\\'re goddamn right I did. Jessep tries to leave the courtroom but is arrested.Dawson and Downey are cleared of the murder and conspiracy charges but found guilty of conduct unbecoming and will be dishonorably discharged. Downey does not understand what they did wrong; Dawson says that they failed to defend those too weak to fight for themselves. Kaffee tells Dawson that it is not necessary to wear a patch on one\\'s arm to have honor. Dawson acknowledges Kaffee as an officer and renders a salute. Kaffee and Ross exchange pleasantries before Ross departs to arrest Kendrick.",

            "plot": "Evelyn Couch is a timid housewife in her 40s in 1980s Birmingham. Her husband Ed has an aunt living at an Alabama nursing home, where Evelyn meets elderly Ninny Threadgoode. Over several encounters, Ninny tells Evelyn about the long-abandoned town of Whistle Stop and its residents. Ninnys tale begins with tomboy Idgie, the youngest member of the Threadgoode family. She and Ruth Jamison are devastated when Idgies beloved older brother and Ruths boyfriend Buddy is killed by a train. Idgie remains socially withdrawn well into her adolescence. At the Threadgoode familys request, the straitlaced Ruth intervenes. Idgie initially rebuffs Ruths attempt at friendship, but over the summer they gradually develop a deep attachment. Ruth eventually moves to Valdosta, Georgia, to marry Frank Bennett. When Idgie visits, she discovers that Frank habitually abuses the pregnant Ruth. Against Franks violent attempts to stop her, Idgie, together with her brother Julian and Big George, rescue Ruth who returns to Whistle Stop with them, where her baby, Buddy Jr, is born. Papa Threadgoode gives Idgie money to start a business and help care for Ruth and Buddy Jr. She and Ruth open the Whistle Stop Cafe, employing the family cook, Sipsey, and her son, Big George, whose excellent barbecue becomes widely popular. Frank comes to Whistle Stop to kidnap his infant son, but an unseen assailant thwarts his attempt, and he is soon reported missing. About five years later, Franks truck surfaces in a nearby river. Idgie becomes a suspect, having publicly threatened Frank for beating Ruth. Sheriff Grady Kilgore detains both her and Big George. He offers to release Idgie and pin Franks supposed murder solely on Big George, but she refuses. During the subsequent trial, Reverend Scroggins provides false testimony that supports both Idgies and Big Georges alibis. Taking into account Franks reputation for drunkenness and his body never being found, the judge rules his probable death as accidental and drops all charges against Idgie and Big George. Shortly after the trial, Ruth is diagnosed with terminal cancer and soon dies. When trains stop running through Whistle Stop, the caf\u00e9 closes, and the townsfolk drift away. Ninnys story concludes, but not before Franks fate is revealed. When Frank attempted to kidnap Buddy Jr, Sipsey hit him over the head with a cast-iron skillet, killing him. Franks truck was pushed into the river, and Idgie convinced Big George to butcher and barbecue Franks body, which they later served to Sheriff Curtis Smoot, who relentlessly investigated Franks disappearance. Smoot proclaimed the meal as the best barbecue he ever ate. Evelyn discovers Ninny was discharged from the nursing home. During her stay there, Ninnys house was condemned and demolished unbeknownst to her. Evelyn finds Ninny where the house once stood. She wants her to live with her and Ed, to which Ninny agrees. They pass by Ruths grave which is freshly adorned with a jar containing honey and a honeycomb. A card reads, Ill always love you, the Bee Charmer. The Bee Charmer was Ruths nickname for Idgie, revealing that Idgie is still alive and is possibly Ninny. As they leave, Ninny recollects how after Ruth died the cafe closed and all the townspeople eventually left.",

            "plot": "In 1941, up-and-coming Broadway playwright Barton Fink accepts a contract from Capitol Pictures in Hollywood to write film scripts for a thousand dollars per week. Upon moving to Los Angeles, Fink settles into the cheap Hotel Earle. His rooms only decoration is a small painting of a woman on the beach, arm raised to block the sun. Fink is assigned to a wrestling film by his new boss Jack Lipnick, but he finds difficulty in writing for the unfamiliar subject. He is distracted by sounds coming from the room next door, and he phones the front desk to alert them of the disturbing sounds. His neighbor, Charlie Meadows, the source of the noise, visits Fink to apologize. During their conversation, Fink proclaims his affection for the common man, and Meadows describes his life as an insurance salesman. Still unable to proceed beyond the first lines of his script, Fink consults producer Ben Geisler for advice. Irritated, the frenetic Geisler takes him to lunch and orders him to consult another writer for assistance. Fink meets the novelist W. P. Mayhew by chance in the bathroom. They briefly discuss movie-writing and arrange a second meeting later in the day. Fink later learns from Mayhews secretary, Audrey Taylor, that Mayhew suffers from alcoholism and that Taylor ghostwrote some of his scripts. With one day left before his meeting with Lipnick to discuss the film, Fink phones Taylor and begs her for assistance. Taylor visits him at the Earle and they have sex. Fink awakens the next morning to find that Taylor has been violently murdered. Horrified, he summons Meadows and asks for help. Meadows is repulsed but disposes of the body and orders Fink to avoid contacting the police. After Fink has a meeting with an unusually supportive Lipnick, Meadows announces to Fink that he is going to New York for several days, and asks him to watch over a package he is leaving behind. Soon afterwards, Fink is visited by two police detectives, who inform him that Meadsows real name is Karl Madman Mundt. Mundt is a serial killer whose modus operandi is beheading his victims. Stunned, Fink places the box on his desk without opening it and he begins writing feverishly. Fink produces the entire script in one sitting and he goes out for a night of celebratory dancing, returning to find the detectives in his room, who inform him of Mayhews murder and accuse Fink of complicity with Mundt. As the hotel is suddenly engulfed in flames, Mundt appears and kills the detectives with a shotgun, after which he mentions that he had paid a visit to Finks parents and uncle in New York. Fink leaves the still-burning hotel, carrying the box and his script. Shortly thereafter he attempts to telephone his family, but there is no answer. In a final meeting with Lipnick, who has been conscripted by the United States Army Reserve to serve as a colonel in the Second World War, Finks script which is suggested to be a nearly word-for-word copy of one of his Broadway plays is lambasted as a fruity movie about suffering, and he is informed that he is to remain in Los Angeles, although Fink will remain under contract, Capitol Pictures will not produce anything he writes until he grows up a little. Dazed, Fink wanders onto a beach, still carrying the package. He meets a woman who looks just like the one in the picture on his wall at the Earle, and she asks about the box. He tells her he does not know what it contains nor who owns it. He asks her if she has ever been in pictures, and she says no, with perceptible disinterest. She then assumes the pose from the picture on the hotel room wall.",

            "plot": "The year is 1929, Tom Reagan is the right-hand man for Irish mobster Leo O'Bannon, a political boss who runs an unnamed US city during Prohibition.  Leo sets off a mob war when he extends protection to his girlfriend Verna's brother, a bookie named Bernie Bernbaum, who is skimming off the match fixing scheme of Leo's rival, the Italian gangster Johnny Caspar.  The situation is further complicated by the fact that behind Leo's back, Verna is also sleeping with Tom.Despite his own relationship with Verna, Tom presses Leo to give up her brother to Caspar. When the war heats up, with an assassination attempt on Leo, Tom tries to persuade Leo that he is foolish to protect Bernie on Verna's behalf, making the point by revealing his affair with her. Leo publicly beats Tom and cuts ties with both him and Verna.Cast out and needing work, Tom turns to Caspar. As a loyalty test, Caspar commands Tom to kill Bernie, an awkward request given Tom's relationship with Bernie's sister. With Caspar's henchmen in tow, Tom leads Bernie to his execution in the woods at a spot called Miller's Crossing. Bernie grovels for his life, pleading Look in your heart. Tom fakes the killing by firing his gun into the ground and orders Bernie to leave town. Caspar's henchmen, who are within earshot but cannot see the two men, are fooled and neglect to check for the body before leaving with Tom.With Leo weakened, Caspar takes his place as city boss, controlling the police and using them to destroy Leo's operations.Within Caspar's gang, there is tension between Tom and Caspar's trusted enforcer, the brutal Eddie Dane the Dane. Upon learning that his men didn't actually see Tom kill Bernie, the Dane takes Tom back to Miller's Crossing to verify that Bernie's body is there. Tom expects to find no corpse and to be executed for it, but instead the group finds a decomposing body that had been shot in the face and disfigured beyond recognition by birds. The Dane and his men assume the body is that of Bernie, but it is actually that of the Dane's lover, a man named Mink, whom Bernie had secretly killed and placed as a decoy where his own body should have been. Tom is now vulnerable if the Dane or Caspar discovers the identity of the body, a fact that Bernie uses in an attempt to blackmail Tom into killing Caspar.With Bernie supposedly dead, someone continues to cut into Caspar's match fix, and Tom and the Dane each try to convince Caspar that the other is behind it. Tom uses the sudden disappearance of Mink to sow suspicion about the Dane by insinuating that Mink has gone into hiding after he and the Dane betrayed Caspar. Caspar must decide between Tom and the Dane, a dilemma he resolves by shooting the Dane in the head as Tom looks on.Tom then thins out his rivals by engineering a surprise meeting between Bernie and Caspar, knowing that the first one to be seen by the other is likely to be killed. Shortly after the arranged time, Tom arrives to discover that Bernie has killed Caspar. Tom tricks Bernie into surrendering his gun and declares his intent to kill him in retribution for his blackmail. Bernie again begs for mercy, saying, as he did at Miller's Crossing, Look in your heart, but this time Tom asks rhetorically What heart and shoots him dead.With Caspar and the Dane dead, Leo resumes his post as the only boss in town. At Bernie's burial, Verna, now back in Leo's good graces, reacts coldly to Tom and walks back to her car. Leo notifies Tom that Verna has proposed to marry him. He offers Tom his job back but Tom turns him down and stays behind, watching Leo as he walks away.",

            "plot": "In 1947 Los Angeles, animated cartoon characters, or toons, co-exist with humans, often employing their skills to entertain as film stars. Private detective Eddie Valiant, once a staunch ally of the toons alongside his brother and co-worker Teddy, has become a depressed alcoholic following Teddy\\'s murder by an unknown toon five years earlier. Maroon Cartoon Studios owner R.K. Maroon, upset about the recent poor performance of his toon star Roger Rabbit, hires Eddie to investigate rumors that Roger\\'s glamorous toon wife, Jessica, is having an affair with Marvin Acme, owner of both the Acme Corporation and Toontown, the animated metropolis in which toons reside. After watching Jessica perform at The Ink and Paint Club, Eddie secretly photographs her and Acme playing patty-cake. He shows the pictures to Roger, who becomes distraught and flees, refusing to believe Jessica was unfaithful. The next morning, Acme is found murdered and evidence at the scene implicates Roger as a suspect. Eddie meets Judge Doom, the sinister human judge of Toontown\u2014having bribed the electorate to gain their votes\u2014and his five weasel minions, the Toon Patrol. Doom confirms he plans to execute Roger using the Dip, a chemical concoction of acetone, benzene, and turpentine which is capable of destroying the otherwise invulnerable toons. Roger\\'s toon co-star, Baby Herman, suggests to Eddie that Acme\\'s missing will\u2014which supposedly bequeaths Toontown to the toons\u2014may have been the killer\\'s true motive. Eddie returns to his office and finds Roger waiting. Roger insists he has been framed and Eddie reluctantly agrees to help after finding evidence of Acme\\'s will; he hides Roger in a bar tended by his girlfriend, Dolores. Jessica tells Eddie that Maroon threatened Roger\\'s career unless she posed for the compromising photos. Meanwhile, Dolores\\'s research uncovers that Cloverleaf Industries recently bought the city\\'s Pacific Electric railway system and will purchase Toontown at midnight unless Acme\\'s will is found. Doom and the Toon Patrol find Roger, but he and Eddie escape with help from Benny, a toon taxi cab. Sheltering in a local movie theater, Eddie sees a newsreel of Maroon selling his studio to Cloverleaf. While Eddie goes to the studio to interrogate Maroon, Jessica abducts Roger. Maroon denies involvement in Acme\\'s murder, admitting he intended to blackmail Acme into selling his company as otherwise Cloverleaf would not buy the studio. Maroon is assassinated and Eddie spots Jessica fleeing the scene. Assuming she is the assailant, he reluctantly follows her into Toontown, choosing to discard the last of his alcohol. After saving Eddie from being shot by Doom, Jessica reveals her actions were to ensure Roger\\'s safety and it was Doom who killed Acme and Maroon. Acme gave his will to Jessica for safety but, when she examined it, the paper was blank. Doom and the Toon Patrol capture Jessica and Eddie, bringing them to Acme\\'s factory. Doom reveals he is the sole shareholder of Cloverleaf and plans to erase Toontown with a Dip-spraying machine so he can build a freeway in its place, and decommission the railway system to force people to use it. When Roger unsuccessfully attempts to save Jessica, the couple is tied onto a hook in front of the machine\\'s sprayer. Eddie distracts the weasels by performing a comedic vaudeville act full of pratfalls, causing them to die of laughter before he kicks their leader into the Dip. Doom is flattened by a steamroller while fighting with Eddie, but he survives, revealing he is actually a disguised toon and Teddy\\'s murderer. Struggling against Doom\\'s toon abilities, Eddie empties the machine\\'s Dip supply, spraying and dissolving Doom to death. The machine crashes through the wall into Toontown, where it is destroyed by a passenger train. As police and toons gather at the scene, Eddie realizes that Acme\\'s will was written on the blank paper in temporarily invisible ink, confirming the toons inherit Toontown. Having regained his sense of humor, Eddie happily enters Toontown alongside Dolores, Roger, Jessica, and the toons.",

            "plot": "By 1950, the 44yearold Puyi, former Emperor of China, has been in custody for five years since his capture by the Red Army during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. In the recently established Peoples Republic of China, Puyi arrives as a political prisoner and war criminal at the Fushun Prison. Soon after his arrival, Puyi attempts suicide, but is quickly rescued and told he must stand trial. 42 years earlier, in 1908, a toddler Puyi is summoned to the Forbidden City by the dying Empress Dowager Cixi. After telling him that the previous emperor had died earlier that day, Cixi tells Puyi that he is to be the next emperor. After his coronation, Puyi, frightened by his new surroundings, repeatedly expresses his wish to go home, but is denied. Despite having scores of palace eunuchs and maids to wait on him, his only real friend is his wet nurse, Ar Mo. As he grows up, his upbringing is confined entirely to the imperial palace and he is prohibited from leaving. One day, he is visited by his younger brother, Pujie, who tells him he is no longer Emperor and that China has become a republic; that same day, Ar Mo is forced to leave. In 1919, Reginald Johnston is appointed as Puyis tutor and gives him a Westernstyle education, and Puyi becomes increasingly desirous to leave the Forbidden City. Johnston, wary of the courtiers expensive lifestyle, convinces Puyi that the best way of achieving this is through marriage; Puyi subsequently weds Wanrong, with Wenxiu as a secondary consort. Puyi then sets about reforming the Forbidden City, including expelling the palace eunuchs. However, in 1924, he himself is expelled from the palace and exiled to Tientsin following the Beijing Coup. He leads a decadent life as a playboy and Anglophile, and sides with Japan after the Mukden Incident. During this time, Wenxiu divorces him, but Wanrong remains and eventually succumbs to opium addiction. In 1934, the Japanese crown him Emperor of their puppet state of Manchukuo, though his supposed political supremacy is undermined at every turn. Wanrong gives birth to an illegitimate child, but the baby is murdered at birth by the Japanese and proclaimed stillborn. She is then taken to a clinic where her physical and mental state declines even further. Puyi remains the nominal ruler of the region until Japans capitulation. He decides to surrender to the Americans but before he can leave, he is captured by the Soviet Red Army and handed over to the Chinese. Under the Communist reeducation program for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the Second SinoJapanese War. After heated discussions with Jin Yuan, the warden of the Fushun Prison, and watching a film detailing the wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese, Puyi eventually recants and is considered rehabilitated by the government; he is subsequently released in 1959. Several years later in 1967, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant proletarian existence following the rise of Mao Zedongs cult of personality and the Cultural Revolution. On his way home from work, he happens upon a Red Guard parade, celebrating the rejection of landlordism by the communists. He sees Jin Yuan, now one of the political prisoners punished as an antirevolutionary in the parade, forced to wear a dunce cap and a sandwich board bearing punitive slogans. Puyi later visits the Forbidden City, now turned into a museum, where he meets an assertive young boy wearing the red scarf of the Pioneer Movement. The boy orders Puyi to step away from the throne, but Puyi proves that he was indeed the Son of Heaven before approaching the throne. Behind it, Puyi finds a 60yearold pet cricket that he was given by palace official Chen Baochen on his coronation day and gives it to the child. Amazed by the gift, the boy turns to talk to Puyi, but finds that he has disappeared. In 1987, a tour guide leads a group through the palace. Stopping in front of the throne, the guide sums up Puyis life in a few, brief sentences, before concluding that he died in 1967.",

After losing her job, she distracts herself by going to the movies, where she finds herself rewatching The Purple Rose of Cairo with a particular focus on archaeologist side character Tom Baxter, who falls in love with a Copacabana singer in the films story. Baxter notices Cecilia watching him and develops an attraction to the point where he addresses her directly and steps out of the film to run off with her, to the chagrin of the other, also sentient characters of the film. While Cecilia and Baxter grow closer as they spend an evening on the town together, the films characters refuse to perform with him gone. The theater manager calls the films producer and Baxters actor Gil Shepherd is informed, who comes to town to fix the problem. Shepherd runs into Cecilia and has her take him to Baxter, who refuses to return to the film as other versions of him across different screenings also start to rebel. Monk hears about Cecilia and Baxters exploits and confronts them. Baxter beats him in a fair fight, so Monk hits him from behind, and a disgusted Cecilia refuses to leave with him. Baxter is accosted by a prostitute and taken to a brothel, but he remains faithful to Cecilia. Shepherd charms and kisses Cecilia, but she turns him down in favor of Baxter. While Purple Rose producers plan to destroy its copies once they get Baxter back inside, he and Cecilia get engaged as he returns to the theater and takes her into the film. Inside, he defies his pre-written romance and shows Cecilia the films world, only for Shepherd to arrive at the theater and profess his love for her. The men argue over her and she chooses Shepherd, loving Baxter but preferring to live in the real world. Baxter reluctantly returns to the film, while Cecilia finally leaves Monk for good, believing she and Shepherd will run away to Hollywood together. He has already left, his seduction a ploy to get Baxter back into the film, though he appears guilty on the return flight. She sits forlornly in the theater watching Top Hat, but the sight of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire dancing to Cheek to Cheek captures her attention and she begins to smile.",

            "plot": "Set in the 1920s and 1930s, the film concerns Leonard Zelig, a nondescript man who has the ability to transform his behavior and demeanor to that of the people who surround him. He is first observed at a party by F. Scott Fitzgerald, who notes that Zelig related to the affluent guests in a refined Boston accent and shared their Republican sympathies, but while in the kitchen with the servants, he adopted a coarser tone and seemed to be more of a Democrat. He soon gains international fame as a human chameleon. Interviewed in one of the witness shots, psychologist Bruno Bettelheim makes the following comment. The question of whether Zelig was a psychotic or merely extremely neurotic was a question that was endlessly discussed among his doctors. Now I myself felt his feelings were really not all that different from the normal, what one would call the well-adjusted, normal person, only carried to an extreme degree, to an extreme extent. I myself felt that one could really think of him as the ultimate conformist. Dr. Eudora Fletcher is a psychiatrist who wants to help Zelig with this strange disorder when he is admitted to her hospital. Through the use of hypnotism, she discovers Zelig yearns for approval so strongly that he physically changes to fit in with those around him. Dr. Fletcher eventually cures Zelig of his compulsion to assimilate, but goes too far in the other direction; for a brief period he is so intolerant of others opinions that he gets into a brawl over whether or not it is a nice day. Dr. Fletcher realizes that she is falling in love with Zelig. Because of the media coverage of the case, both patient and doctor become part of the popular culture of their time. However, fame is the main cause of their division. Numerous women claim that he married and impregnated them, causing a public scandal. The same society that made Zelig a hero destroys him. Zeligs illness returns, and he tries to fit in once more, before he disappears. Dr. Fletcher finds him in Germany working with the Nazis before the outbreak of World War II. Together they escape, as Zelig uses his ability to imitate one more time, mimicking Fletchers piloting skills and flying them back home across the Atlantic upside down. They eventually return to America, where they are proclaimed heroes and marry to live full happy lives.",

            "plot": "Attorney Frank Galvin is an alcoholic ambulance chaser. As a favor, former partner Mickey Morrissey sends him a medical malpractice case which is all but certain to be settled for a significant amount. The case involves a young woman given general anesthesia during childbirth at a Catholic hospital, after which she choked on her vomit and was left comatose. The plaintiffs, her sister and brother-in-law, intend to use the settlement to pay for her care. A representative of the Catholic diocese offers a 210,000 settlement about 675,000 in 2024. Galvin declines and states his intention to go to trial. While preparing, he encounters Laura Fischer in a bar, and they become romantically involved. Galvin experiences several setbacks. The hospitals attorney, Ed Concannon, has a large legal team that is masterful with the press. The comatose womans brother-in-law angrily confronts Galvin after Concannons team tells him of the settlement offer that Galvin rejected. Galvins medical expert disappears before testifying and a substitutes credentials are challenged. Nobody who was in the operating room is willing to testify that negligence occurred. In chambers during the trial, Judge Hoyle threatens Galvin with disbarment, but Galvin dismisses him as a bagman for the local political machine. Hoyle denies Galvins motion for a mistrial and threatens to have him arrested. Galvin notices that the admitting nurse, Kaitlin Costello, filled out a form that included the question, When did you last eat? Galvin and Morrissey discover she is now a pre-school teacher in New York City. Galvin travels there to seek her help. As Laura arranges to meet him, Morrissey discovers a check in her handbag and realizes that Concannon is paying her for inside information. Morrissey informs Galvin of Lauras betrayal. Galvin confronts her in a bar and strikes her. On the flight back to Boston, Morrissey suggests moving for a mistrial due to Concannons ethics violation, but Galvin decides to continue. In the courtroom, Costello testifies that she wrote that the patient ate a full meal one hour before being admitted, contradicting the patient record, which states a nine-hour interval. Her superiors threatened her with termination unless she changed the original record from 1 to 9, but before doing so, she made a photocopy, which she brought to court. Concannon objects that for legal purposes, the original is presumed to be correct, but Hoyle unexpectedly reserves judgment. Costello testifies that the anesthesiologist later confessed that he had failed to read her admitting notes and administered general anesthesia. As a result, the patient vomited and choked. When the anesthesiologist realized his error, he threatened to end Costellos career if she did not change the admitting form. Concannon again objects on the grounds that the hospitals original admitting record has precedence. Hoyle agrees and declares Costellos testimony stricken from the record. Despite believing his case is hopeless, Galvin gives a passionate closing argument. The jury finds in favor of the plaintiffs, and the foreman asks whether the jury can award more than what was asked for. That night, a drunk Laura dials Galvins office number. He moves to answer the call but changes his mind and lets the phone continue to ring.",

            "plot": "In 2285, Admiral James T Kirk oversees a simulator session of Captain Spocks trainees. In the simulation, Lieutenant Saavik commands the starship USS Enterprise NCC-1701 on a rescue mission to save the crew of the damaged ship Kobayashi Maru, but is attacked by Klingon cruisers and critically damaged. The simulation is a no-win scenario designed to test the character of Starfleet officers. Later, Dr. Leonard McCoy visits Kirk on his birthday; seeing Kirk in low spirits due to his age, the doctor advises Kirk to get a new command instead of growing old behind a desk. Meanwhile, the starship Reliant is on a mission to search for a lifeless planet to test the Genesis Device, a technology designed to reorganize dead matter into habitable worlds. Reliantrs Captain Clark Terrell and first officer Commander Pavel Chekov beam down to evaluate a planet they mistakenly believe to be Ceti Alpha VI. Once there, they are captured by the genetically-engineered tyrant Khan Noonien Singh, who explains that they are on Ceti Alpha V. Fifteen years prior, Kirk exiled Khan and his followers there after they attempted to take over Enterprise; six months later, Ceti Alpha VI exploded, shifting the orbit of Ceti Alpha V and turning it into a desert wasteland. This killed several of Khans people; many others, including his wife, were killed by the native parasitic Ceti eels. Khan implants Chekov and Terrell with eel larvae, rendering them susceptible to mind control; he uses the pair to capture Reliant. Learning of the Genesis Device, Khan attacks space station Regula I, where the device is being developed by Kirks former lover, Dr. Carol Marcus, and their son, David. Kirk assumes command of Enterprise after the ship, deployed on a training cruise, receives a distress call from Regula I. En route, Enterprise is ambushed and crippled by Reliant. Khan offers to spare Kirks crew if they relinquish all material related to Genesis; Kirk instead stalls for time and, taking advantage of Khans unfamiliarity with starship controls, remotely lowers Reliantrs shields, enabling a counter-attack. Khan is forced to retreat and effect repairs, while Enterprise limps to Regula I. Kirk, McCoy, and Saavik beam to the station and find Terrell and Chekov alive, along with the slaughtered members of Marcus team. They soon find Carol and David hiding Genesis deep inside the nearby planetoid. Khan, having used Terrell and Chekov as spies, orders them to kill Kirk; Terrell resists the eels influence and kills himself, while Chekov collapses as the eel leaves his body. Khan transports Genesis aboard the Reliant, intending to maroon Kirk on the lifeless planetoid, but is tricked by Kirk and Spocks coded arrangements for a rendezvous. Kirk directs Enterprise into the nearby Mutara Nebula, successfully taunting Khan into following him; conditions inside the nebula render shields useless and compromise targeting systems, making Enterprise and Reliant evenly matched. Spock notes that Khans tactics indicate inexperience in three-dimensional combat, which Kirk exploits to disable Reliant. Mortally wounded, Khan activates Genesis, quoting Captain Ahab from the novel Moby Dick as he dies. Though Kirks crew detects the activation and attempts to move out of range, they will not be able to escape the nebula in time without the ships inoperable warp drive. To restore warp power, Spock goes to the engine room, which is flooded with radiation. When McCoy tries to prevent Spocks entry, Spock incapacitates him with a Vulcan nerve pinch and performs a mind meld, telling him to remember. Spock repairs the warp drive, and Enterprise jumps to warp, escaping the explosion, which forms a new planet. Before dying of radiation poisoning, Spock urges Kirk not to grieve, as his decision to sacrifice himself to save the Enterprise was a logical one. Kirk and the ships crew host a space burial for Spock, whose photon torpedo casket lands on the new Genesis planet",

            "plot": "John Rambo, a Vietnam War veteran, goes to a lakehouse looking for his old comrade Delmar Barry only to learn that Barry died due to cancer a year ago, brought on by exposure to Agent Orange during the war. Rambo offers his condolences to Barrys widow for her loss and gives her a photo of the pair and the rest of their unit called Baker Team. Rambo continues his travels, where he reaches the town of Hope, Washington. Will Teasle, the towns sheriff,  drives him to the outskirts of town and explains that he considers it as his job to keep drifters out of Hope. Neglecting Teasles warning, Rambo returns to Hope, which prompts Teasle to arrest Rambo on charges of vagrancy, resisting arrest and possession of a concealed knife. While being processed at the police station, Rambo continues to be defiant and Teasles deputies, led by the sadistic chief deputy Art Galt, abuses him, triggering flashbacks of the torture which Rambo endured in Vietnam. When they attempt to dry shave him with a straight razor, Rambo finally fights his way out of the sheriffs station, regains his knife and flees on a motorcycle into the woods. Teasle organizes a search party with rifles, dogs and a helicopter. Galt blatantly disregards Teasles orders and proper procedure and attempts to shoot Rambo dead from the helicopter with a sniper rifle. Cornered on a high cliff, Rambo leaps into a tree, injuring his right arm. With Galt still shooting at him, Rambo throws a rock at the helicopter, cracking its windshield and causing the pilot to briefly lose control. Losing his balance, Galt falls to his death on the jagged rocks in a gorge below. Rambo tries to surrender to Teasle, reasoning that Galts death was an accident and that he wants no more trouble, but the deputies shoot at him and Rambo flees. Other deputies warn Teasle that Rambo is a Green Beret warrior and Medal of Honor recipient, but Teasle swears revenge and continues the search. Using guerilla tactics, Rambo nonlethally subdues all the deputies. With the deputies incapacitated, Rambo corners Teasle, holds a knife to his throat and threatens a war Teasle wont believe if he does not give up the pursuit, before retreating further into the woods. The Washington State Patrol and Washington National Guard are dispatched to assist Teasle, along with Rambos mentor and former commanding officer Col. Sam Trautman. Trautman advises that Rambo should be allowed to escape to Seattle to defuse the situation and be permitted to surrender peacefully, but Teasle, confident that Rambo is hopelessly outnumbered, refuses to go with Trautmans plan. Teasle allows Trautman to contact Rambo to persuade him to surrender, but Rambo refuses, condemning Teasle and his deputies for their abuse and citing that they drew first blood. At the entrance of an abandoned mine, a National Guard detachment corners Rambo. Ignoring Teasles instructions to wait for his arrival, the guardsmen fire a rocket launcher, collapsing the mine entrance and seemingly killing Rambo. Teasle furiously berates the guardsman for disobeying his orders and demands that their leader Clinton Morgan dig out Rambos body. However, Rambo survives the attack, where he escapes the mine through a ventilation shaft, hijacks a military truck carrying an M60 machine gun and ammunition and returns to Hope to cause as much damage as possible in revenge. In an effort to distract the authorities, Rambo blows up a gas station, cuts power to most of the town, destroys a sporting goods store and shoots the sheriffs station. Trautman, understanding that Teasle is outmatched, again tries to convince Teasle to leave Rambo. Teasle, seeing Rambos rampage as a personal attack, ignores Trautmans orders again and tries to hunt for Rambo on the stations roof, but Rambo manages to shoot and injure Teasle in a gunfire. When Rambo prepares to kill Teasle, Trautman appears and warns Rambo that he will be killed unless he surrenders, reminding him that he is the last survivor of Baker Team. Rambo vents about the horrors of war and his traumatic experiences like watching his friends give their lives in Vietnam, being treated poorly when returning home, being unable to hold a job and being forgotten despite his sacrifices. Rambo breaks down crying as he recounts how a good friend was killed by a Viet Cong child soldier using a shoeshiner box wired with explosives. After being comforted by a visibly disturbed Trautman, Rambo surrenders and is taken into federal custody, while Teasle is taken to a waiting ambulance for transport to the hospital.",

Conrad is now dealing with posttraumatic stress disorder and is seeking help to cope with his emotions.Conrad\\'s father, Calvin, attempts to connect with his surviving son and understand his wife, while Conrad\\'s mother, Beth, denies her loss, hoping to maintain her composure and restore her family to what it once was. She appears to have favored her older son and has grown cold toward Conrad due to his suicide attempt. Beth is determined to maintain the appearance of perfection and normality, and her efforts only serve to alienate Conrad further. Conrad works with Dr. Berger and begins to learn how to deal with his emotions rather than control them. He starts dating a fellow student, Jeannine, who helps him regain a sense of optimism. However, Conrad still struggles to communicate and establish normal relationships with his parents and schoolmates.Beth and Conrad often argue while Calvin tries to referee, generally taking Conrad\\'s side for fear of pushing him over the edge again. Tensions escalate near Christmas when Conrad becomes furious at Beth for not wanting to take a photo with him, swearing at her in front of his grandparents. Afterwards, Beth discovers Conrad has been lying about his afterschool whereabouts. This leads to a heated confrontation between Conrad and Beth in which Conrad points out that Beth never visited him in the hospital; Conrad argues that if Buck had been hospitalized in his place, she would have gone to see him, to which Beth curtly replies that Buck would never have been in the hospital in the first place. Beth and Calvin take a trip to see Beth\\'s brother Ward in Houston, where Calvin presses Beth about her evasive attitude.Conrad suffers a setback when he learns that Karen, a friend from the psychiatric hospital, has committed suicide. A cathartic breakthrough session in the middle of the night with Dr. Berger allows Conrad to stop blaming himself for Bucks death and accept his mothers frailties. However, when Conrad tries to show affection, Beth is unresponsive, leading Calvin to emotionally confront her one last time. He questions their love and asks whether she is capable of truly loving anyone. Stunned, Beth packs her bags and goes back to Houston. Calvin and Conrad are left to come to terms with their new family situation, affirming their father son love.",

            "plot": "On the American frontier of 1874, a new railroad under construction will have to be rerouted through the town of Rock Ridge to avoid quicksand. Realizing this will make Rock Ridge worth millions, territorial attorney general Hedley Lamarr plans to force Rock Ridge\\'s residents out of the town and sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky Taggart, to shoot the sheriff and trash the town. The townspeople demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades dimwitted Le Petomane to appoint Bart, a black railroad worker about to be executed for assaulting Taggart. A black sheriff, Lamarr reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos and leave Rock Ridge at his mercy. After an initial hostile reception in which he takes himself hostage to escape, Bart relies on his quick wits and the assistance of Jim, an alcoholic gunslinger known as the Waco Kid, to overcome the townspeople\\'s hostility. Bart subdues Mongo, an immensely strong and dimwitted, yet philosophical henchman sent to kill him, then outwits German seductressforhire Lili Von Shtupp at her own game, with Lili falling in love with him. Upon release, Mongo vaguely informs Bart of Lamarr\\'s connection to the railroad, so Bart and Jim visit the railroad worksite and discover from Bart\\'s best friend Charlie that the railway is planned to go through Rock Ridge. Taggart and his men arrive to kill Bart, but Jim outshoots them and forces their retreat. Furious that his schemes have backfired, Lamarr recruits an army of thugs, including common criminals, motorcycle gangsters, Ku Klux Klansmen, Nazi soldiers, and Methodists. East of Rock Ridge, Bart introduces the White townspeople to the black, Chinese, and Irish railroad workers who have all agreed to help them in exchange for acceptance by the community, and explains his plan to defeat Lamarr\\'s army. They labor all night to build a perfect copy of the town as a diversion. When Bart realizes it will not be enough to fool the villains, the townsfolk construct copies of themselves. Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the Gov. William J. Le Petomane Thruway, forcing the raiding party to send for change to pay the toll. Once through the tollbooth, the raiders attack the fake town and its population of dummies, which have been booby trapped with dynamite. After Jim detonates the bombs with his sharpshooting, launching bad guys and horses skyward, the Rock Ridgers attack the villains with Lili singing with the Nazi soldiers. The resulting brawl between townsfolk, railroad workers, and Lamarr\\'s thugs literally breaks the fourth wall and bursts onto a neighboring movie set where director Buddy Bizarre is filming a Busby Berkeleystyle tophatandtails musical number. Then the brawl spreads into the studio commissary for a food fight and spills out of the Warner Bros. film lot onto the streets of Burbank. Lamarr escapes the brawl and takes a taxi to hide at Mann\\'s Chinese Theatre which is showing the premiere of Blazing Saddles. As he settles into his seat, he sees onscreen Bart arriving on horseback outside the theatre. Bart blocks Lamarr\\'s escape and shoots him in the groin. Bart and Jim then enter the theater to watch the end of the film. Back in the film, Bart announces to the townspeople that he is moving on because his work is done and because he is bored. Riding out of town, he finds Jim, still eating his popcorn, and invites him along to nowhere special. The two friends briefly ride into the desert before dismounting and boarding a limousine which drives off into the sunset.",

So Serpicos story is shown in a flashback. Serpico graduates from the police academy with big ideas for improving the police forces community relations. He dresses like an actual civilian instead of wearing the departments standard plainclothes dress, which is easily recognizable. While he is chasing a burglar, other officers fail to recognize him as one of their own and shoot at him. He realizes that deviating from protocols can be dangerous. Serpico reports an attempted bribe to a high-ranking investigator, who chuckles and advises him to keep the money. Serpico soon learns that corruption is rampant in his police department. Forced to accompany officers as they collect payoffs from criminals and small businesses, Serpico refuses to accept his share of the money. He makes several attempts to alert superiors to the corruption but is rebuffed every time. Other officers learn that he is reporting them, and he begins to fear for his life. Serpico and his well-connected friend Blair go to the mayors assistant, who promises a real investigation and support but is stymied by political pressure. Ostracized, frustrated and fearful, Serpico sinks into depression, which ruins his relationship with his girlfriend. He begins brutalizing well-connected suspects who had been bribing other officers and thought themselves protected. Finally, Serpico informs Captain McClain that he has reported his experiences to oversight agencies outside the police force. Furious, McClain tells the other officers. Blair uses his connections to arrange a personal interview with the district attorney, who tells Serpico that if he testifies to a grand jury, a major investigation will follow. The DA limits his questions and prevents Serpico from revealing the ubiquity of corruption in the police force. Serpico and Blair take their story to The New York Times. After his allegations are printed, his superiors retaliate by assigning him to a dangerous narcotics squad in Brooklyn. During a raid on a drug traffickers apartment, Serpicos partners hold back at a critical moment, and Serpico gets shot in the face. After a long, painful recovery, he testifies before the Knapp Commission, a government inquiry into NYPD corruption. Frank Serpico resigned from the NYPD on June 15, 1972, was awarded the NYPD Medal of Honor for conspicuous bravery in action, and moved to Switzerland.",

Lee is persuaded to attend a highprofile martial arts tournament in Han\\'s private island to gather evidence that will prove Han\\'s involvement and suspicions to in drug trafficking and prostitution. Since Han\\'s island is only partly in their jurisdiction, they are unable to conduct any formal investigations. Han doesn\\'t allow firearms on the island to prevent assassination attempts and also prevent the international authorities from launching a raid. Han runs a martial arts school to protect his illegal operations and holds the tournament to recruit martial artists to expand his illegal business. Lee agrees to help Braithwaite, believing his efforts will also redeem the honor of the Shaolin temple that was tarnished by Han. Shortly before his departure, Lee also learns that Han\\'s bodyguard O\\'Hara is responsible for the death of his sister Su Lin. Lee arrives on Han\\'s island and receives a warm reception. Joining him are other competitors, including Roper, an American playboy and gambler, who is indebted and on the run from the mob, and Williams, an AfricanAmerican activist, who is on the run after defending himself against two racist cops in LA. Roper and Williams are former Karate brothers and fellow Vietnam War veterans, who also have a betting scam going: one will underperform until the other can get a bet on the outcome at good odds. Roper and Williams win their first fights easily. The rules of Han\\'s tournament are simple: Competitors compete in oneonone matches against each other, the opponent, who gets knocked to the ground loses each round. Any weapons are strictly prohibited in the fighting arena. At the end of the first day, the competitors are all offered girls of their choice by Han\\'s assistant Tania. Williams chooses several women, while Roper cunningly chooses Tania as a mutual attraction grows between them. Lee chooses a girl, which he saw in Han\\'s entourage, who is Mei Ling, a covert agent whom Braithwaite had placed on the island to gather intelligence. However, Mei Ling has been unable to escape Han\\'s strict observation to never leave their rooms. That night, Lee begins to stealthily search and infiltrate the island for evidence and finds a secret entrance to an underground compound base, where drugs are being manufactured and tested on unwitting prisoners. Lee runs into Han\\'s guards, but manages to take them down and flee before they can identify him. Lee is seen by Williams, who is outside for some fresh air and practice, despite strict rules against being outside after night. The next morning, Han warns the competitors about wandering out of their rooms at night. Han punishes his guards for their inability to fulfill their duties by leaving them to be killed by Bolo, Han\\'s giant enforcer and chief bodyguard. After the execution, the competition resumes as Lee is called to his first match and his opponent turns out to be O\\'Hara. During the fight, Han warns O\\'Hara to step down as Lee keeps outclassing him in a humiliating fashion. Lee kills O\\'Hara after he tries to attack him with a pair of halfshattered glass bottles, thus avenging Su Lin\\'s death. An embarrassed Han abruptly ends the day\\'s competition after stating that O\\'Hara\\'s treachery has disgraced them. Later, Han summons Williams in his office and accuses him of attacking the guards the previous night. Williams denies this and decides to leave the island. Han brutally beats Williams to death with his iron prosthetic left hand. Han takes Roper on a tour of his underground base and invites him to be his representative for his illegal operations in US. Han also implicitly threatens to imprison Roper with other martial artists, who joined Han\\'s tournaments in the past, if Roper does not join his operation. Roper reluctantly accepts after Han throws the mutilated corpse of Williams over a pit of acid, hinting that Roper will face the same fate if he refuses to cooperate with Han. The same night, Lee infiltrates the underground base again to gather sufficient evidence to warrant Han\\'s arrest and manages to send a message to Braithwaite. After a prolonged battle with Han\\'s guards, Lee is eventually lured into a door trap to get imprisoned and captured. The next morning, Han commands Roper to fight Lee, but Roper refuses and Han has him fight Bolo. Roper manages to overpower and beat Bolo after a gruelling battle. Han orders all his men to kill Lee and Roper. Despite facing insurmountable odds, the island\\'s prisoners, released by Mei Ling, and the other invited martial artists aid Lee and Roper in defeating Han\\'s guards. Amidst the chaos, Han attempts to fight his way out to escape, only to have Lee pursuit and corner him to his museum, where Han retrieves a bladedtalon replacement for his hand to prepare for a brutal fight. Han retreats into a room full of mirrors, which proves disorientating for Lee until Lee keeps a strategy in mind and smashes all the mirrors to spoil Han\\'s illusions to easily spot Han. Lee kicks Han, who gets impaled on his own spear that was halfway harpooned through a wall. Lee returns to Roper and they exchange a weary thumbs up as the military finally arrives to take control of the island.",

            "plot": "Lewis Medlock, Ed Gentry, Bobby Trippe, and Drew Ballinger are Atlanta businessmen who decide to canoe down the Cahulawassee River in the remote northern Georgia wilderness before it is dammed. Lewis is an avid outdoorsman and survivalist who leads the group, and Ed has been on several trips but lacks Lewis\\'s ego, while Bobby and Drew are novices. En route to their launch site, the men, in particular Bobby, are rude toward the locals, who are hostile to the city boys. At a local gas station, Drew, with his guitar, engages a young banjo-playing boy in a musical duel. The duel is mutually enjoyable, and some of the locals break into dance at the sound of it. However, the boy does not acknowledge Drew when prompted for a friendly handshake. The four friends travel in pairs and their two canoes become separated. Ed and Bobby encounter a pair of mountain men emerging from the woods, one carrying a shotgun and missing his two front teeth. Following an argument, Bobby is forced by the men to undress and the unarmed man rapes him, demanding he squeal like a pig, while Ed is tied to a tree and held at gunpoint. Lewis sneaks up and kills the rapist with his bow and arrow while Ed snatches the shotgun from the other mountain man, who flees into the woods. After a heated debate between Lewis and Drew, Ed and Bobby vote to side with Lewis plan to bury the body and continue on as if nothing had happened. The four continue downriver but the canoes reach a dangerous stretch of rapids. As Drew and Ed reach the rapids in the lead canoe, Drew falls into the water. The canoes collide on the rocks, throwing the three remaining men into the river and smashing one of the canoes. Lewis breaks his thigh bone and the other two are washed ashore alongside him in a gorge. Lewis, who believes Drew fell out of the boat because he was shot, encourages Ed to climb to the top of the gorge and ambush the other mountain man, whom they believe to be stalking them from above. Ed reaches an overhang and hides out until morning, when a man appears above him and aims a rifle at him; a panicked Ed clumsily shoots and manages to kill the man, but falls backwards and lands on one of his own arrows. Ed worries that he has killed the wrong man when he inspects the body to find that the man has all of his teeth, but he then realizes the man is wearing dentures. Ed and Bobby weigh down the mans body in the river to ensure it will never be found, then do the same to Drews body when they encounter it downriver shortly after. Upon finally reaching the small town of Aintry, Ed and Bobby take Lewis to the hospital. The three carefully concoct a cover story for local authorities about Drews death, lying about their adventure to Sheriff Bullard in order to escape a possible double murder charge. Their cover is almost blown when Ed thinks he has overheard Bobby secretly telling the sheriff the truth, but Bobby convinces him otherwise. Ed and Bobby visit Lewis in the hospital, where Lewis is being watched over by a police officer. A worried Ed whispers to Lewis that they need to change their cover story, but Lewis relaxes him by pretending that he has no memory of what happened after they fell off the canoes due to head trauma. Sheriff Bullard does not believe the men and reveals that Deputy Queen is suspicious of them because his brotherinlaw went hunting a few days ago and has not returned. However, he has no evidence to arrest them, and instead tells them never to do this kind of thing again and to never come back to the area. The three men vow to keep their story of death and survival a secret for the rest of their lives. Ed reunites with his wife and son. Some time after, a bloated hand rises from the lake, only to be revealed as a nightmare from the experience that torments Ed.",

He leaves behind a threatening letter demanding he be paid $100,000 or he will kill more people. The note is found by Inspector Harry Callahan, who is investigating the killing. The mayor teams up with the police to track down the killer; to stall for time, he agrees to Scor pios demand over Callahans objections. During his lunch break, Harry foils a bank robbery. He shoots one robber dead, and holds another at gunpoint with his Smith amp Wesson Model 29 revolver, giving him an ultimatumI know what youre thinking: Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, Ive kinda lost track myself. But being this is a 44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, youve got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do you, punk? Despite surrendering, the robber insists on knowing, and Harry jovially pulls the trigger, revealing the gun is empty.Harry is assigned a rookie partner, Chico Gonzalez, against his opposition to working with yet another inexperienced police officer. Meanwhile, Scorpio is spotted by a police helicopter while staking for potential victims, but he escapes. After assisting in preventing a suicide, Harry and Gonzalez learn that Scorpio has murdered a 10yearold AfricanAmerican boy. Based on Scor pios letter, the police think his next victim will be a Catholic priest, and set a trap for him.Scorpio eventually arrives, kills a police officer in a shootout, and flees. The next day, the police receive another letter in which Scorpio claims to have kidnapped a teenager named Ann Mary Deacon. He threatens to kill her if he is not given a ransom of $200,000. Harry is assigned to deliver the money, wearing a radio earpiece so Gonzalez can secretly follow him. Scorpio instructs Harry via payphones around the city. They meet at the Mount Davidson cross, where Scorpio beats Harry and admits he intends to kill him and let Ann Mary die. Gonzalez intervenes and gets shot in the chest. Harry manages to stab Scorpio in the leg, but he escapes.Harry learns of Scor pios hospital visit and a doctor reveals that the killer lives in a room at Kezar Stadium. Harry finds him there and chases him, shooting him in the leg. Harry tortures Scorpio into confessing where Ann Mary is being held, but the police find her dead. The district attorney reprimands Harry for his conduct, explaining that because Harry obtained his evidence against Scorpio illegally, all of it is inadmissible in court, and Scorpio is to be freed. An outraged Harry continues to shadow Scorpio on his own time. Scorpio pays a man $200 to beat him severely and frames Harry for it, forcing Harry to stop following him. Meanwhile, a hospitalized Gonzalez tells Harry of his intention to leave the SFPD and become a teacher instead.Scorpio steals a pistol from a liquor store owner and hijacks a school bus. He contacts the police with another ransom demand that includes a flight out of the country. Harry waits for him, then jumps onto the roof of the bus from an overpass. Scorpio crashes the bus into a dirt mound and flees to a nearby quarry, where he takes a hostage before Harry wounds him. Harry aims his revolver and reprises his ultimatum about losing count of his shots. Scorpio reaches for his gun and Harry shoots. This time, the gun fires, killing Scorpio.

            "plot": "In the winter of 1943-44, MI6 officers Colonel Turner and Admiral Rolland assign Major John Smith, five other commandos of the Special Operations Executive, and U.S. Army Ranger Lieutenant Morris Schaffer of the OSS to rescue U.S. Army Brigadier General George Carnaby, a chief planner for the Western Front, captured by the Germans and held at the Schlo\u00df Adler, a mountaintop fortress in the Bavarian alpine village of Werfen, accessible only by cable car. Disguised as German troops, Smith and his team are to parachute in, infiltrate the castle, and rescue Carnaby before the Germans can interrogate him. After a Ju 52 transport plane drops the team, agent Mary Ellison is dropped separately in secret, her presence known only to Smith. Though two commandos are mysteriously killed, Smith continues the operation; he keeps Schaffer as a close ally, and helps Mary meet local agent Heidi Schmidt, who arranges for Mary to be employed at the castle. Smith starts revealing to Mary that the mission is not what it initially seems - Carnaby\\'s capture was deliberately staged by the British, and that Carnaby himself was replaced with an impersonator named Cartwright Jones. In Werfen, the Germans eventually surround the commandos in a gasthaus, forcing them to surrender. Smith and Schaffer (being officers) are separated from the remaining three operatives: Thomas, Berkeley, and Christiansen. Smith and Schaffer kill their captors, blow up a supply depot, and prepare an escape route for later use. They ride on the roof of a cable car up to the castle, and then climb inside when Mary lowers a rope. German General Rosemeyer and Standartenf\u00fchrer Kramer are interrogating Carnaby when the three new prisoners arrive, who reveal themselves as German double agents. Smith and Schaffer intrude, weapons drawn, but Smith forces Schaffer to disarm, identifying himself as Sturmbannf\u00fchrer Johann Schmidt of the Schutzstaffel\\'s SD intelligence branch. He conveys proof of his identity, which includes showing the name of Germany\\'s top spy in Britain to Kramer, who silently affirms it. He exposes \"General Carnaby\" as Corporal Cartwright Jones, and claims that the double agents are British impostors, Smith proposes that they prove themselves by writing down the names of their fellow agents in Britain, to be compared to his own list in his pocket. After the three finish their lists, Smith takes them and then reveals that he was bluffing, and that the actual objective of the mission was to exploit the staged capture of Carnaby/Jones to penetrate the Sicherheitsdienst in order to obtain the identities of the German agents and their commander. Meanwhile, Mary is visited by Sturmbannf\u00fchrer von Hapen, an SD officer attracted to her, but he becomes suspicious of flaws in her cover story. Leaving her, he happens upon the scene of Carnaby\\'s interrogation just as Smith finishes his explanation. Von Hapen puts everyone under arrest but is distracted when Mary arrives. Schaffer kills von Hapen and the other German officers with his silenced pistol. The group then makes its escape, taking the three double agents as prisoners. Schaffer sets explosives to create diversions around the castle, while Smith uses the radio room to inform Rolland of their success. From there they head to the cable car station, sacrificing Thomas as a decoy. Berkeley and Christiansen break free and attempt their own escape in a cable car; both are thwarted and killed by Smith. The group reunites with Heidi on the ground, boarding a bus they prepared earlier as an escape vehicle. They battle their way onto an airfield and escape via their Ju 52 transport, where Turner is waiting. In the air, Smith reveals that Kramer confirmed Turner as Germany\\'s top spy in Britain. Rolland lured Turner and the other double agents into the mission to expose them. Smith\\'s trusted partner Mary and the American Schaffer (who had no connection to MI6) were assigned to the mission to ensure its success. Turner aims a Sten gun, but Rolland anticipated such a move and removed its firing pin. To avoid a humiliating court martial and execution, Turner is permitted to jump from the aircraft to his death. As the exhausted operatives fly home, Schaffer humorously tells Smith to keep his next operation \"all-British\".",

            "plot": "In March 1944, OSS officer Major John Reisman is ordered by the commander of ADSEC in Britain, Major General Sam Worden, to undertake Project Amnesty, a top secret mission to turn some of the U.S. Armys worst convicts into highly skilled commandos to eliminate Wehrmacht officers at a ch\u00e2teau near Rennes, disrupting the German chain of command in northern France ahead of DDay. Any convicts who survive the mission will receive a pardon. Reisman meets the twelve convicts at a military prison operated by the Military Police Corps. These five are condemned to death for murder, while the others face lengthy sentences, including hard labor for crimes such as assault, larceny, mugging and impersonation. Reisman quickly establishes his authority, but the group remains disgruntled. Overseen by MPs led by Sergeant Bowren, the convicts gradually learn to operate together when they are forced to build their own training camp. However, an act of insubordination by Franko results in the mens shaving and wash kits being withheld as punishment, leading the group to be nicknamed the Dirty Dozen. During their training, the convicts are psychoanalyzed by Captain Kinder, who warns Reisman that there is a chance that at least 7 of them will likely kill him if given the chance and that Maggott is by far the most dangerous. With their commando training almost complete, the Dirty Dozen are sent for parachute training at a facility commanded by Reismans nemesis, Colonel Everett Dasher Breed of the 101st Airborne Division. However, Breed is curiously not briefed about Project Amnesty. Rather than making inquiries to higher command, Breed makes several attempts to discover Reismans mission, including infiltration of the Dirty Dozens camp. Reisman, with the eager assistance of the convicts, angrily kicks Breed and his men out of the camp. Later, Breeds testimony combined with Reisman rewarding the Dirty Dozen with the exception of Maggott, as his crime is the rape and murder of one with prostitutes at the end of their training, prompts the ADSEC staff to consider terminating the project and sending the men back to serve their original sentences. Reisman defends the convicts training and agrees to have them compete against Breeds men in war games to test their mettle. Breed finds this ridiculously humorous, but to his surprise, the Dirty Dozen successfully capture his headquarters and Worden allows Reisman to resume his mission. Upon parachuting into northern France, Jiminez breaks his neck during the jump. With a man down, the mission proceeds with the German-speaking Wladislaw and Reisman infiltrating the chateau disguised as German officers. However, all surprise is lost when Maggott breaks cover by murdering an officers spouse before he is killed by Jefferson for compromising the mission. The sound of gunfire makes the Wehrmacht officers and their companions retreat to a locked underground bomb shelter, but the unit pours gasoline through ventilation shafts and Jefferson throws grenades into the shelter through the shafts, killing the officers and their civilian guests. After a firefight that kills nearly all the Dozen, Reisman, Bowren and Wladislaw escape back to England alive. Worden pardons Wladislaw, who is given the opportunity to resume his work in the armed forces. As the credits roll, Reisman communicates to the other convicts next of kin that they lost their lives in the line of duty",

            "plot": "A gang of bandits led by Calvera periodically raids a poor Mexican village for food and supplies. After the latest raid, during which Calvera kills a villager, the village leaders decide to fight back. They send three villagers carrying their few objects of value to try and barter for weapons.In a town just inside the United States, the villagers find Chris, a veteran Cajun gunslinger, and approach him. Chris advises that they instead hire gunfighters to defend the village, as men are cheaper than guns. At first agreeing only to help them recruit, Chris eventually leads the group.Despite the meager pay, Chris finds five willing gunmen. They include Vin Tanner, a gunfighter gone broke from gambling; Chris friend Harry Luck, who assumes Chris is hiding a much bigger reward for the work; the Irish Mexican Bernardo OReilly, who has fallen on hard times; Britt, an expert in both knife and gun who joins purely for the challenge involved; and the dapper, on-the-run gunman Lee, plagued by nightmares of fallen enemies and so haunted that he has lost his nerve for battle. On their way to the village, they are trailed by the hotheaded Chico, an aspiring gunfighter whose previous attempts to join Chris had been spurned. Impressed by his persistence, Chris allows him into the group.Arriving at the village, they work with the villagers to build fortifications and train them in combat. They note the lack of young women in the village until Chico stumbles upon Petra and discovers the women were hidden in fear that the gunmen would rape them. The gunmen begin to bond with the villagers, and Petra pursues Chico. When Bernardo points out that the gunmen are being given the choice food, they share it with the village children.Three of Calvera\\'s men are dispatched to reconnoiter the village; due to a mistake by Chico, the seven are forced to kill all three. Some days later Calvera and his bandits arrive in force. The seven and the villagers kill eleven gang members and run the rest out of town. The villagers celebrate, believing Calvera will not return. However, Chico infiltrates Calvera\\'s camp and learns that Calvera will return, as his men are short on food. Some villagers fear reprisals and call for the gunfighters to leave. Even some of the seven waver, but Chris insists that they stay.The seven ride out for a pre-emptive raid on Calvera\\'s camp but find it abandoned. Returning to the village, they are captured by Calvera and his men, who have colluded with some of the villagers to sneak in and take control. Calvera spares the seven\\'s lives, part believing they have been disillusioned by the betrayal, and part fearing reprisals from their friends across the border.Preparing to depart, Chris and Vin admit they have become emotionally attached to the village. Bernardo likewise gets angry when the boys he befriended call their parents cowards. Chico declares that he hates the villagers; when Chris points out he grew up as a farmer as well, Chico angrily responds that it is men like Calvera and Chris who made the villagers what they are.The gang escorts the seven gunmen from the village and returns their weapons. The seven debate their next move. All agree to return and fight, except Harry, who believes the effort is futile and suicidal.The gunmen infiltrate the village and a gunfight breaks out. Harry, who has had a change of heart, returns in time to save Chris\\'s life but is himself fatally shot. Harry pleads to know what they were fighting for, and Chris lies about hidden gold to let Harry believe he died for a fortune; Harry smiles before dying. Lee finds the nerve to burst into a house where several villagers are being held, shooting their captors and releasing the prisoners to join the fight, but is gunned down as he leaves the house. Bernardo, shot protecting the boys he befriended, tells them as he dies to see how bravely their fathers fought. Britt dies after killing many bandits and exposing himself from cover. Chris shoots Calvera, who demands to know why he came back for the village. The remaining bandits flee.After Chico decides to stay with Petra, Chris and Vin bid farewell to the village elder. The elder tells them that only the villagers have won, whereas the gunslingers are like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on. As they pass the graves of their fallen comrades, Chris admits the elder was right.",

            "plot": "A psychiatrist is called to the room of a Los Angeles hospital, where a man named Miles Bennell is being held in custody. The man claims to be a doctor, and recounts the events leading up to his arrest and arrival at the hospital.At work, Bennell meets a number of patients suffering from Capgras delusion. His girlfriend, Becky, has just come back to town after settling a divorce. The couple are called to the home of a friend of the doctor, Jack Belicec, who has found what appears to be a body in his home. It has no features or fingerprints, and starts to change, beginning to take on the features of Belicec. Another body is found in Beckys basement that is her duplicate. Before any further investigation can take place, the bodies disappear.Bennell and Jacks wife Teddy find duplicates of themselves emerging from pods in Bennells greenhouse. They conclude that the townspeople are being replaced while asleep with copies. Bennell tries to make a call to authorities, but the operator claims that all lines are busy and he cannot be put through, so Jack and Teddy drive off to seek help in the next town over. Bennell and Becky realize that all of Santa Miras inhabitants have been replaced and are devoid of any sort of humanity. They hide at Bennells office for the night.Truckloads of the pods arrive downtown. Becky and Bennell listen as chief Nick Grivett directs the others to take them to towns to be planted and used to replace their populations. Kauffman and Belicec arrive at Bennells office with pods for Becky and Bennell. It is revealed that a race of alien impostors is responsible for the invasion, and that if they arent stopped, humanity will lose all emotions and sense of individuality.Bennell and Becky escape from the office. To avoid capture, they mimic the impostors mannerisms and pretend to be part of the huge crowd of replaced townspeople. However, a panicked Becky screams at a near-traffic accident and her reaction exposes their humanity to the aliens. An alarm is sounded and the couple flees on foot.The couple manage to escape and hide in a mine outside town, however, after a while hiding they hear music, and Bennell leaves Becky briefly to investigate. He sees a farm with hundreds of pods being loaded onto trucks. Bennell returns to tell Becky, but realizes that she fell asleep before he could return and is now one of them.

            "plot": "In Los Angeles during the mid-1950s, teenager Jim Stark is arrested and taken to the juvenile division of a police station for public intoxication. At the station he crosses paths with John Plato Crawford, who was brought in for killing a litter of puppies, and Judy, who was brought in for curfew violation. The three separately reveal their innermost frustrations to the officers; all three of them suffer from problems at home. Jim feels anguished by his constantly bickering parents, Frank and Carol, but even more so by his timid father\\'s failure to stand up to Carol; the issues are further complicated by Frank\\'s interfering mother. His frustrations are made manifest to officer Ray Fremick when Jim is released to their custody.Judy is convinced that her father ignores her because she is no longer a little girl, so she dresses up in racy clothes to get attention, which only causes her father to call her a dirty tramp, while Plato\\'s father abandoned his family when he was a toddler, and his mother is often away from home, leaving Plato in the care of his housekeeper.On the way to his first day at Dawson High, Jim again meets Judy and offers her a ride. Seemingly unimpressed by Jim, she declines and is instead picked up by her friends, a gang of delinquents led by Buzz Gunderson who Judy is also dating. Jim is shunned by the rest of the student body but is befriended by Plato, who comes to idolize Jim, and according to Pomerance and Krauss, Jim is an idealized father for Plato.After a field trip to Griffith Observatory, Buzz provokes and challenges Jim to a knife fight; Jim bests Buzz by knocking his switchblade out of his hand, then throws his own blade away. To preserve his status as gang leader, Buzz suggests stealing some cars to have a Chickie Run at a seaside cliff. At home, Jim ambiguously asks his father about defending one\\'s honor in a dangerous situation, but Frank advises him against confrontation of any kind. That night, during the chickie run, Buzz plunges to his death when the strap on his jacket sleeve becomes entangled with his door-latch lever, preventing him from exiting the car. As police approach, the gang flees, leaving Judy behind, but Jim persuades her to leave with him and Plato.Jim later confides to his parents his involvement in the crash and considers turning himself in. When Carol declares they are moving again, Jim pleads with Frank to stand up for him. When Frank refuses, Jim attacks him in frustration, then storms off to the police station to confess, only to be turned away by the desk sergeant. Jim drives back home, finding Judy waiting for him. She apologizes for her prior treatment of him due to peer pressure, and the two begin to fall in love. Agreeing to never return to their respective homes, Jim suggests they visit an old deserted mansion Plato told him about.Meanwhile, Plato is intercepted by three members of Buzz\\'s gang, who are convinced that Jim betrayed them to the police. They steal Plato\\'s address book and pursue Jim; Plato retrieves his mother\\'s gun and leaves to warn Jim and Judy, finding them at the mansion. The three new friends act out a fantasy as a family. Plato then falls asleep, and Jim and Judy leave to explore the mansion, where they share their first kiss. Buzz\\'s gang find and wake up Plato, who, frightened and distraught, shoots and wounds one of the gang. When Jim returns, he attempts to restrain Plato, who flees, accusing Jim of abandoning him.Plato runs to the observatory and barricades himself inside as more police converge including Fremick who, along with Frank and Carol, has been searching for Jim. Jim and Judy follow Plato into the observatory, where Jim persuades Plato to trade the gun for his red jacket; Jim quietly removes the ammunition before returning it, and then convinces Plato to come outside. When the police notice that Plato still has the gun, they shoot Plato dead as he charges them, unaware that Jim had removed the bullets. Frank comforts his grieving son, vowing to be a better father. Now reconciled with his parents, Jim introduces them to Judy.",

            "plot": "In the 1920s, Sean \"Trooper Thorn\" Thornton, an Irish-born American retired boxer, travels from Pittsburgh to his birthplace of Inisfree to purchase the old family farm. Shortly after arriving, he meets and falls in love with fiery, red-headed Mary Kate Danaher, the sister of bullying Squire \"Red\" Will Danaher. Will also wants to buy the old Thornton property, and is angered when the property\\'s current owner, the wealthy Widow Tillane, accepts Sean\\'s bid instead of his. Will then retaliates by refusing consent for Sean to marry his sister. Some village residents, including parish priest Father Peter Lonergan and local matchmaker-cum-bookmaker Michaeleen \u00d3ge Flynn, trick Will Danaher into believing that Widow Tillane will marry him if Mary Kate is no longer under his roof. He gleefully allows the marriage, but he refuses to give Mary Kate her dowry when he finds he was deceived, and the Widow Tillane knows nothing about the deal. Sean, unschooled in Irish customs, professes no interest in obtaining the dowry; but to Mary Kate, the dowry represents her personal value to the community and her freedom. She insists that the dowry must be received to validate their marriage, causing an estrangement between her and Sean. The villagers eventually persuade Will to release Mary Kate\\'s furniture, but Will refuses to hand over the monetary part of the dowry. Mary Kate believes Sean is a coward for not fighting Will. Sean goes to the local Church of Ireland minister and fellow former boxer, the Rev. Cyril Playfair, and reveals that he once accidentally killed a younger, married opponent in the ring. Sean had sworn to give up fighting out of fear and guilt over the manslaughter. Mary Kate also confesses her part in the quarrel to Father Lonergan, who berates her for her selfishness. She and Sean partially reconcile that night, and they share the bedroom for the first time since their marriage. However, the next morning, Mary Kate quietly leaves their cottage and boards a train for Dublin, hoping this pretense of leaving will spur Sean to action. Sean soon learns from Michaeleen where she is, races his horse to the railway station, and pulls her off the train. Followed by a growing crowd of villagers, Sean forces Mary Kate to walk with him the 5 mi back to the Danaher farm. There, Sean confronts Will and demands the dowry money. When Will refuses, Sean throws Mary Kate back at her brother, declaring he will abide by the Irish custom \"no fortune, no marriage\". The ultimatum shocks both Mary Kate and Will, who finally pays the \u00a3350. Sean immediately burns it in the boiler, abetted by Mary Kate. She proudly leaves for home, but a humiliated Will takes a swing at Sean, only to be knocked down by Sean\\'s defensive counter-punch. A donnybrook ensues, then evolves into a long Homeric fistfight between Sean and Will after they insincerely agree to adhere to the Marquess of Queensberry rules. This much-anticipated match attracts more and more spectators as it continues for miles across the landscape. The fighters finally pause for a drink inside Cohan\\'s Bar, where they begrudgingly admit a mutual respect for one another. As they argue over who will pay for the drinks, Will tosses a brew into Sean\\'s face. Sean punches Will, sending him falling through the bar doors to lie unconscious in the street, ending the fight. Later, the reconciled and inebriated brothers-in-law stagger arm-in-arm back to Sean and Mary Kate\\'s home for supper, much to Mary Kate\\'s amusement and delight. The next day, a humbled Will and the Widow Tillane begin their own courtship, and they ride out of the village side by side in a jaunting car driven by Michaeleen. Sean, Mary Kate, and the villagers wave to them as they pass, before Sean and Mary Kate playfully chase each other across the fields back to the cottage.",

            "plot": "After a flying saucer lands in Washington, D.C, the United States Army quickly surrounds it. A humanoid emerges and announces that he comes in peace and with good will. When he unexpectedly opens a small device, he is shot and wounded by a nervous soldier. A tall robot emerges from the saucer and quickly disintegrates the soldiers weapons. The alien orders the robot, Gort, to desist. He explains that the now-broken device was a gift for the President of the United States that would have enabled him to study life on the other planets. Klaatu is taken to Walter Reed Army Hospital. After surgery, he uses a salve to quickly heal his wound. The Army is unable to enter the saucer. Gort stands outside, silent and unmoving. Klaatu tells the President\\'s secretary, Mr. Harley, that he has a message that must be delivered to all the world\\'s leaders simultaneously. Harley tells him that in the current world situation, this is impossible. Klaatu proposes that he spend time among ordinary humans to better understand their unreasoning suspicions and attitudes. Harley rejects the proposal, and Klaatu remains locked in his hospital room. Klaatu escapes and stays in a boarding house using the name Mr. Carpenter, adopted from a dry cleaner\\'s suit tag. Among the residents are young widow Helen Benson and her son Bobby. Helen\\'s boyfriend, Tom Stevens, becomes jealous of the stranger. Bobby takes Klaatu on a tour of the city, including a visit to his father\\'s grave in Arlington National Cemetery; Klaatu learns that most of the dead are soldiers killed in wars. They also visit the Lincoln Memorial. When Klaatu asks Bobby, Who is the greatest living person?, Bobby suggests Professor Barnhardt. They visit the scientist\\'s home, but he is out; Klaatu sees that Barnhardt\\'s blackboard is covered with equations an attempt to solve the three-body problem. Klaatu adds to them and, after being discovered by the housekeeper, leaves his contact information. That evening, a government agent escorts Klaatu to Barnhardt. Klaatu tells Barnhardt that the people of other planets are concerned about Earth\\'s possible aggression, now that humanity has developed rockets and rudimentary atomic power. He states that if his message is ignored, Earth could be eliminated. Barnhardt agrees to gather scientists from around the world at the saucer; he also suggests that Klaatu peacefully demonstrate the power he possesses beforehand. Klaatu returns to his spaceship, unaware that Bobby is following him. Bobby watches as Gort knocks out two soldiers so Klaatu can reenter the saucer. Bobby runs home and tells Helen. She does not believe him, but Tom is suspicious. The next day, for half an hour, starting at 12 noon east coast time, all electrical equipment on Earth ceases to function, except for essential services, such as hospitals and aircraft in flight. Klaatu learns that Bobby watched him the previous night. He visits Helen at work, reveals his mission, and asks that she not betray him. Helen asks Tom to keep Klaatu\\'s identity secret, but he refuses to listen, already in the process of alerting the military. Helen and Klaatu rush to Barnhardt\\'s home. They hope that Barnhardt can hide Klaatu until the meeting that evening. Klaatu tells Helen that if anything should happen to him, she must go to Gort and say, Klaatu barada nikto. The Army tracks them in their taxi. Klaatu is shot and killed, and his body is moved to a nearby police station cell. Helen rushes to the saucer and says Klaatu\\'s phrase to Gort. Gort retrieves Klaatu\\'s body, and revives him inside the saucer, though Klaatu tells Helen that his revival is only temporary. Helen departs the spaceship with Klaatu and Gort, joining Dr. Barnhart among the gathered scientists. Klaatu tells the scientists gathered outside that an interplanetary organization has created a police force of invincible robots like Gort. In matters of aggression, we have given them absolute power over us. Klaatu concludes, Your choice is simple: join us and live in peace, or pursue your present course and face obliteration. We shall be waiting for your answer. Klaatu and Gort depart in the saucer.",

            "plot": "Johnny Farrell, an American newly arrived in Buenos Aires, Argentina, wins a lot of money cheating at craps. He is rescued from a robbery attempt by a complete stranger, Ballin Mundson. Although Farrell is warned not to cheat at an illegal high-class casino he tells him about, he ignores his advice. After winning at blackjack, he is taken to see the casinos owner, who turns out to be Mundson. Farrell talks him into hiring him and soon becomes Mundsons trusted casino manager. Mundson returns from a trip and announces he has an extremely beautiful new wife, Gilda, whom he has married after only knowing her for a day. Johnny and she instantly recognise each other from the past, though both deny it when he questions them. Mundson assigns Farrell to watch over Gilda. The pair are consumed with hatred for each other, and she cavorts with men at all hours in increasingly more blatant efforts to enrage Johnny, and in return he grows more spiteful towards her. Mundson is visited by two German mobsters. Their organisation had financed a tungsten cartel, with everything put in Mundsons name in order to hide their connection to it. They have decided that it is safe to take over the cartel now that World War II has ended, but Mundson refuses to transfer ownership. The Argentinian police are suspicious of the Germans and assign agent Obreg\u00f3n to try to obtain information from Farrell, but he knows nothing about this aspect of Mundsons operations. The Germans return to the casino during a carnival celebration, and Mundson ends up deliberately shooting and killing one of them. Farrell rushes to take Gilda to safety. Alone in Mundsons house, they have another confrontation and, after declaring their undying hatred for each other, passionately kiss. After hearing the front door slam, they realise Mundson has overheard them, and a guilt-ridden Farrell pursues him to a waiting private airplane. The plane explodes in midair and plummets into the ocean. Mundson parachutes to safety. Farrell, unaware of this, concludes that he is dead. Gilda inherits his estate. Farrell and she immediately marry, but unknown to her Johnny is marrying her to punish her for her betrayal of Mundson, which is hypocritical, since he also betrayed Mundsons trust. He abandons her, but has her followed day and night by his men to torment her. Gilda tries to escape the tortured marriage a number of times, but Farrell thwarts every attempt. Obreg\u00f3n confiscates the casino and informs Farrell that Gilda was never truly unfaithful to Mundson or to him, prompting Farrell to try to reconcile with her as he prepares to return home to the US. At that moment, Mundson reappears, revealing his faked suicide. He tries to kill both Gilda and Farrell, but the casino worker, Uncle P\u00edo, fatally stabs him in the back. When Obreg\u00f3n arrives, Johnny tries to take the blame for the murder, but Obreg\u00f3n points out that, since Mundson was already declared legally dead, he cant arrest him. Farrell gives Obreg\u00f3n incriminating documents from Mundsons safe. He and Gilda finally reconcile, agreeing to go home together.",

            "plot": "Moonee, a sixyearold girl, lives with her young, single mother, Halley, at Magic Castle Inn and Suites, a budget motel in Kissimmee, Florida, near Walt Disney World. Moonee spends most of her summer days unsupervised and making mischief with her downstairs neighbor, Scooty whom Halley is supposed to watch while his mother, Ashley, works as a waitress at a diner, and Dicky, who lives at the nearby Futureland Inn. After Stacy, a new Futureland resident, catches the trio spitting on her car, Dicky is grounded for a week, and Moonee and Scooty meet and befriend Stacy\\'s granddaughter, Jancey, who lives with Stacy. Halley has recently lost her job as a stripper after refusing to have sex with clients, but this now affects her eligibility for TANF benefits; she begins relying on food that Ashley gets from work. Struggling to pay the rent, Halley begins selling knockoff perfume to tourists in the parking lots of upscale hotels. Meanwhile, Moonee and Scooty show Jancey around the neighborhood and teach her things, like how to get ice cream by begging. They regularly inconvenience Bobby, the Magic Castle\\'s manager, once shutting off the motel\\'s power. Despite this, he remains protective of them. Bobby\\'s duties include preparing expense reports, ejecting drug dealers, and doing repairs; he sometimes enlists the help of his son, Jack, with whom he has a tenuous relationship. After Dicky\\'s family moves to New Orleans, Scooty finds a lighter in a box that Dicky\\'s family left behind; he, Moonee, and Jancey start a fire at an abandoned condominium complex. Seeing the fire, Ashley figures out that Scooty was involved, and forbids him from hanging out with Moonee or Jancey; she also stops talking to Halley. Without the free food from Ashley, and with security guards beginning to bother her at the hotels, Halley\\'s financial situation declines even further. She begins soliciting sex work online, keeping Moonee in the bathroom with loud music when she has a client over. When Halley steals a client\\'s Disney World resort passes to scalp them, he returns to demand them back. Bobby scares him off but applies restrictions on unregistered guests in Halley\\'s room; he also warns her that he will evict her if she continues having clients over. In desperation, Halley approaches Ashley to apologize and ask for money. Ashley criticizes Halley for doing sex work; enraged, Halley viciously beats her in front of Scooty. The next day, DCF investigators show up and question Halley and Moonee separately about their lifestyle. In anticipation of another visit, Halley gives away her weed and has Moonee help clean their room. They go to a fancier hotel and have an extravagant meal, which Halley charges to a guest\\'s room. When they return to Magic Castle, the investigators, having found evidence of Halley\\'s sex work, are waiting with two police officers to take Moonee into foster care while they finish their inquiry.

            "plot": "In 1989, Harvard law graduate Bryan Stevenson travels to Alabama, intending to help defend poor people who cannot afford proper legal representation. Teaming with Eva Ansley, he forms the Equal Justice Initiative in the state capital, Montgomery. He embarks on trying to combat social injustices in criminal law and practice, which have resulted in a high rate of African Americans convicted and incarcerated in the state and nationwide. Stevenson goes to a state prison to meet inmates who are on death row and who are seeking appeals of their convictions or sentences. Among these is Walter Johnny D. McMillian, an African-American man who was convicted of the 1986 murder of Ronda Morrison, an 18-year-old white girl. McMillian has maintained his innocence. When Stevenson reviews the evidence in the case, he learns that it hinges entirely on the testimony of convicted felon Ralph Myers. The convict had provided highly contradictory testimony to the prosecution in exchange for a plea deal and lighter sentence in his own pending trial. Given these issues, Stevenson appeals to the current prosecutor, Tommy Chapman, for aid; he dismisses him without looking at his notes. Stevenson learns that, at the time of the murder, McMillian\\'s family friend Darnell Houston was elsewhere with a witness who had subsequently falsely corroborated Myers\\' testimony. This evidence would cause the prosecution\\'s case to fall apart, so Stevenson asks Houston to testify to his account. When Stevenson submits his testimony, police arrest Houston for perjury. Although Stevenson gets the perjury charges dismissed, Houston is intimidated, so he refuses to testify in court. Shortly afterward, Stevenson is threatened by two sheriff deputies, who force him from his car at gunpoint and illegally search the car. They refuse to tell him why he was pulled over, but release him. During this period, Stevenson had a case on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of another death row inmate, Herbert Lee Richardson; the court denied the appeal. Convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend\u2019s niece with a bomb on her porch, Richardson had been sentenced to death by electric chair. Unable to get it overturned, Stevenson promises to be with Richardson in his final moments and witnesses the execution. On behalf of McMillian, Stevenson directly confronts Myers. He admits that police coerced his testimony by threatening him with a death sentence. Stevenson appeals to the local court to grant McMillian a retrial and successfully convinces Myers to recant his testimony on the stand, but the judge refuses to grant it. Stevenson appears on 60 Minutes to rally public support in favor of McMillian, and appeals the court\\'s decision to the Supreme Court of Alabama. The Supreme Court overturns the circuit court\\'s decision, and grants McMillian a retrial. Stevenson tries to have the charges dismissed entirely. He confronts Chapman at home and tries to convince him to join in this motion; Chapman forces him to leave. On the day of the motion, Stevenson appeals to the judge. That day, Chapman joins him in the motion, the judge dismisses the charges, and McMillian is finally released from prison and reunited with his family. An epilogue notes that Stevenson and Ansley continue their fight for justice. McMillian remained friends with Stevenson until his natural death in 2013. A follow-up investigation into Morrison\\'s 1986 murder confirmed McMillian\\'s innocence. Evidence suggested that a white man was likely responsible, but the case has never been officially solved. McMillian\\'s former cellmate, Anthony Ray Hinton, remained on death row for 28 years. Stevenson handled his defense and was eventually able to get all the charges dropped. Hinton was released in 2015.",

Meanwhile, Tyler, a man fired for bringing in illegal crab catches, burns the gear of his rivals, Duncan and Ratboy, and flees himself. While on the run, Zak and Tyler meet, and embark on a journey to the Salt Water Rednecks wrestling school in North Carolina. Zaks caretaker at the nursing home, Eleanor, sets out to find Zak and return him safely to the facility. Zak and Tyler become friends while traveling. Tyler teaches Zak various life skills, including how to use a shotgun, and eventually takes on the role of his coach, getting him in shape for his wrestling endeavors. They build a raft and begin traveling by water. Eleanor soon finds them, but after learning her boss intends to send Zak to a more severe form of confinement, joins them to travel south. That night, Duncan and Ratboy catch up with the trio, and Zak defends them with a shotgun. When they reach Ayden, North Carolina, Tyler learns that the Salt Water Redneck has retired and closed the school, but convinces him to resurrect his alter ego for Zak. Salt Water trains Zak as a wrestler, and quickly puts Zak on a local fight card, which he believes he has rigged for Zaks safety and success. However, when the fight happens, Zaks opponent, Sam, does not hold back, and proceeds to beat him. As Tyler attempts to intervene, Duncan and Ratboy arrive, and Duncan hits Tyler on the head with a tire iron, knocking him unconscious right as Zak manages to lift Sam overhead and throw him forcefully out of the ring, something Salt Water had told him was impossible. The film ends with Tyler healing from the injury, as Eleanor drives him and Zak to Florida, implying the start of a new life for the three of them as a family.",

            "plot": "In Atlanta, Miles, self-named Baby, is a young getaway driver who lost his parents in a car crash that left him with tinnitus, and finds catharsis in music. He ferries crews of robbers assembled by kingpin Doc to pay off a debt as recompense for theft of a car containing Docs illicit goods. Between jobs, he remixes snippets of recorded conversations and cares for his deaf foster father Joseph. At the local diner, Bo\u2019s Diner, he meets a waitress named Debora, and they start dating. His next robbery goes awry after an armed bystander chases them down, but Baby evades him and the police. Having paid his debt, Baby quits his life of crime and starts delivering pizzas. Baby takes Debora out on a date at a fancy restaurant where he runs into Doc, who pays for their meal. Meeting Baby outside, Doc convinces him to join his planned postoffice heist under threat of retaliation. The crew consists of easygoing Buddy, his sharpshooter wife Darling, and triggerhappy psychopath Bats, who takes a dislike to Baby. While the crew attempts to purchase illegal arms at a rendezvous from a contact of Docs, The Butcher, Bats recognizes the Butcher and his men are undercover police and opens fire, resulting in most of the dealers being killed. Afterward, Bats makes Baby stop at Deborahs diner, unaware of Baby and Deborahs romance. Baby, aware of Batss homicidal habit, stops him from killing her to avoid paying. Doc is furious, revealing that the dealers were dirty cops on his payroll. He decides to cancel the heist, but Bats, Buddy and Darling disagree. Doc lets Baby decide; he chooses to go through with it. Baby attempts to slip away late that night, hoping to take Debora and leave. He is stopped by Buddy and Bats, who have discovered his recordings and believe he is a police informant; when they and Doc hear his mixtapes, they are convinced of his innocence. During the heist, Bats kills a security guard. Disgusted, Baby refuses to drive away, causing Bats to hit him. Baby rams the car into a rebar which impales Bats, killing him. The three flee on foot. After the police kill Darling in a shootout, Buddy furiously blames Baby for her death and plans to kill him. Baby steals a car and flees to his apartment. After leaving Joseph at an assisted living home with his heist earnings, Baby rushes to Bos for Debora, where Buddy is waiting. Baby shoots Buddy and flees with Debora as police reinforcements swarm the restaurant. At the safe house, Doc refuses Babys pleas for help, but relents when he sees Debora consoling him. Doc supplies them with cash and an escape route out of the country. The three are confronted by the Butchers vengeful henchmen in the parking garage, but Doc kills them all. Buddy ambushes them with a stolen police car and kills Doc. A catandmouse game ensues until Buddy has Baby at his mercy. He shoots next to both Babys ears, temporarily disorienting him, but the distraction allows Debora to subdue Buddy with a crowbar. After Baby shoots him in the leg, Buddy falls to his death. Baby surrenders after he and Debora encounter a police roadblock. At Babys trial, Joseph, Debora, and other individuals Baby helped testify as character witnesses. He is sentenced to 25 years in prison, with a parole hearing after five. Debora stays in contact with Baby during his incarceration, and once he is released, they reunite with a new car and drive off into the sunset.",

            "plot": "Ten years after the deadly Simian Flu pandemic, the humans are nearly extinct, with only about 1 in 500 02 genetically immune. Human civilization has been destroyed after societal collapse among humans. The apes, all bestowed with genetically enhanced intelligence by the virus, establish a colony in the Muir Woods National Monument near San Francisco, led by Caesar, along with his lieutenants Maurice, Rocket, and Koba. A group of humans, led by Malcolm, unknowingly enter the apes territory in search of a hydroelectric dam that would restore power to their community in San Francisco. Carver, a member of Malcolms group, injures Ash, Rockets young son, in fear. Malcolm manages to prevent further escalation, and Caesar orders the humans to leave. Prompted by Koba, Caesar brings his army to the human community as a show of strength. Caesar announces that, while the apes do not want war, they will fight to defend themselves he demands the humans stay in their territory. Malcolm convinces Dreyfus, the communitys leader, to give him a chance to take a small team to the forest to negotiate with the apes and access the dam. Eventually, Caesar allows them to work on the generator on the condition that they surrender their guns. While working together, Malcolm, his nurse wife Ellie, and his son Alexander bond with the apes. The fragile truce briefly falls apart when Carver is discovered to have kept a hidden gun and is thus forcibly sent away, but trust is restored when Ellie saves Cornelia, Caesars ill wife. Concerned that the apes may attack, Dreyfus arms the community with the munitions at the Fort Point armory. Koba, who hated the humans for torturing him as a laboratory test subject, discovers the armory and confronts Caesar, accusing him of caring more about humans than apes. Caesar beats Koba in response but refrains from killing him. Koba kills two guards in the armory to steal a gun and returns home. He secretly kills Carver after the humans succeed in repairing the generator. Koba uses their celebration to covertly set fire to the ape colony. Unseen by the others, he shoots Caesar, who falls into the underbrush. Koba frames the humans for Caesars apparent death and the fire to justify war. Taking command, he leads the ape army to San Francisco, where they plunder the armory and mount a fullscale assault on the humans. Despite taking heavy casualties, the apes breach the building and imprison the humans as Dreyfus flees. Koba kills Ash for refusing to kill unarmed humans and imprisons all other apes loyal to Caesar, including Rocket, Maurice, and Luca. Malcolms family finds a severely wounded Caesar and transports him to his former home in San Francisco. After sneaking back into the settlement to find medical supplies, Malcolm encounters Blue Eyes, Caesars young son. Blue Eyes has him at gunpoint but decides to let him go until he learns from Malcolm that his father is still alive. Blue Eyes accompanies Malcolm to Caesar. Learning that it was Koba who shot Caesar, Blue Eyes reconciles with his father. The trio returns to the community and frees the imprisoned humans and apes. After escorting the apes into the tower, Malcolm finds Dreyfus, who has rigged the base of the tower with C4, and reveals that his men made contact with a military base. Malcolm holds Dreyfus and his men at gunpoint to give Caesar enough time to retake command by confronting Koba at the top of the tower. In an attempt to kill all the apes, Dreyfus detonates explosives to destabilize the building, killing himself in the process. Caesar defeats Koba and refuses to help him as he falls to his death. Malcolm warns Caesar of the approaching human military. Believing that the humans will never forgive the apes for their attack, Caesar tells Malcolm to leave with his family for safety before the fighting begins. He then addresses the apes as they prepare for the upcoming war.",

Taylor, a United States Marine Corps veteran, records their activities for a college class after they return to duty from a recent officer-involved shooting. At a public disturbance call, Tre, a Bloods gang member, yells racial insults at Zavala, who responds by accepting a one-on-one fistfight. Zavala wins and earns Tres respect for not charging him with assault. Later that night, Tre and his fellow Bloods are attacked in a drive-by shooting by the Mexican-American Curbside Gang. The following night, the officers respond to a noise complaint at a house party, where Taylor and Zavala encounter Curbside Gang members Big Evil and LaLa. Taylor and Zavala rescue children from a house fire while on patrol and are awarded the Medal of Valor. During a traffic stop, they arrest a man who is in possession of several ornate firearms and large amounts of cash. Taylor urges Zavala to join him in investigating further, leading them to another man guarding a home full of human trafficking victims. When ICE agents intervene, the officers learn that the house is tied to the Sinaloa Cartel and are strongly urged to stay clear due to possible reprisals. Taylor soon becomes engaged to his girlfriend Janet and Zavalas wife Gabby gives birth to their first child. One night, Taylor and Zavala respond to a call from their rookie fellow officer, Sook. Arriving on scene, they find her partner Van Hauser has been stabbed through the eye, and rescue Sook from being savagely beaten nearby; both survive but promptly retire. Taylor marries Janet, and at their wedding Zavala tells Taylor that, should anything happen to him, he will take care of Janet. The next day, the officers are called to perform a wellness check on an elderly woman, but in her house they discover large amounts of heroin, dismembered corpses, and a message from the cartel. Unbeknownst to them, the ICE has eavesdropped on a cartel phone call ordering the two officers green-lit for assassination; Big Evil, LaLa, and others are tasked with killing them. While on patrol, the officers encounter Tre who, as a favor from their earlier encounter, warns them that some friends who were recently released from Folsom State Prison learned that both officers were green-lit, but Taylor and Zavala shrug it off. Taylor reveals to Zavala that Janet is pregnant. Taylor and Zavala are baited into chasing a reckless driver into an apartment complex where they are ambushed by the Curbside Gang. They kill several gangsters and fight their way into an alley, but Taylor is shot in the chest. As Zavala tries to treat Taylors injuries, the assassins arrive and fire on the officers, apparently killing them. Shortly after, LAPD backup arrives in force and guns down the assassins when they refuse to surrender. Zavala is killed, but Taylor survives, having been shielded by Zavalas body. At Zavalas funeral, Taylor tries to deliver a eulogy, but only manages to say a single sentence: He was my brother. In a flashback to the day of the shooting, Zavala recounts to Taylor a humorous story from the first time he and his wife slept together, before the two receive a call from dispatch.",

Columbus, a former college student with a unique set of zombie survival rules, travels from Austin, Texas, towards Columbus, Ohio, to search for his parents. On the way, he meets Tallahassee, who somewhat reluctantly agrees to give Columbus a ride towards Ohio. On the way, he mentions to Columbus that he misses his puppy, Buck, who was killed by zombies. The pair meet con artist sisters Wichita and Little Rock, who trick Tallahassee and Columbus and steal their weapons and Escalade after Little Rock feigns being bitten by a zombie. The two men find a yellow Hummer H2 loaded with weapons and continue on before running into another trap set by the girls, who take them hostage. Tallahassee steals his gun back and has a stand-off with Wichita, until Columbus intervenes saying that they have bigger problems to worry about, resulting in an uneasy truce between them. The sisters reveal they are going to the Pacific Playland amusement park in Los Angeles, an area supposedly free of zombies. After learning his hometown has been destroyed, and his parents likely killed, Columbus and Tallahassee decide to accompany them to the amusement park. When the group reaches Hollywood, Tallahassee directs them to Bill Murrays house. Tallahassee and Wichita meet Murray, uninfected and disguised as a zombie, and they play a prank on Columbus and Little Rock by having him pretend to be a zombie, only for Columbus to accidentally kill Murray. Columbus soon realizes that Buck was actually Tallahassees son, who got infected and died as a result. Despite Wichita and Columbus falling for each other, Wichita abruptly leaves with Little Rock for Pacific Playland the next morning. Columbus decides to go after Wichita and convinces Tallahassee to join him. At Pacific Playland, the sisters activate all the rides and lights, only to unwittingly draw the attention of many zombies in the area. They become trapped on a drop tower ride as Tallahassee and Columbus arrive. Tallahassee lures the zombies to a game booth and kills several as Columbus heads to the drop tower; he evades and shoots through a horde and safely helps the girls down. Wichita kisses Columbus and reveals her real name: Krista. Deciding to stick together from now on, the group then leaves Pacific Playland.",

            "plot": "Tim Thomas, sending a text message while driving, caused a car crash in which seven people died: six strangers and his fiancee, Sarah Jenson. In a bid for redemption, and unable to live with the guilt of his actions, Tim sets out to save the lives of seven good people. A year after the crash, having quit his job as an aeronautical engineer, Tim donates a lung lobe to his brother Ben, an IRS employee. Six months later he donates part of his liver to social services worker Holly. After that, he begins searching for more candidates to receive donations. He finds George, a junior hockey coach, and donates a kidney to him, and donates bone marrow to a young boy, Nicholas. Tim contacts Holly and asks if she knows anyone who deserves help. She suggests Connie Tepos, who lives with an abusive boyfriend, so he gives her his number in case she wants his help. Tim moves out of his house and into a local motel, taking with him his pet box jellyfish. One night, after being beaten, Connie contacts Tim, who gives her the keys and deed to his beach house. She takes her two children and they move into their new home. Having stolen his brother\\'s credentials, and presenting himself as Ben, Tim checks out candidates for his two final donations. The first is Ezra Turner, a blind meat salesman and pianist. Tim calls him at work, harassing him, to check if he is quick to anger. Ezra remains calm, so Tim decides he is worthy. He then contacts Emily Posa, a self-employed greeting card printer who has a heart condition and a rare blood type. Tim spends time with her, weeding her garden and fixing her rare Heidelberg Windmill press. He begins to fall in love with her and decides that, as her condition has worsened, he needs to make his donation. Ben tracks down Tim at Emily\\'s, demanding that Tim return his IRS credentials. After an interlude with Emily, Tim leaves her sleeping and returns to the motel. He fills the bathtub with ice water to preserve his vital organs, climbs in, and kills himself by pulling his box jellyfish into the water with him. His friend Dan acts as executor to ensure that his organs are donated, his heart to Emily and his corneas to Ezra. Afterward, Emily meets Ezra at his concert at a park, and they begin to talk.",

            "plot": "In August 2005, inside a small, dimly-lit cell, Dalton Russell proclaims he has committed the perfect bank robbery. In New York City, masked robbers, dressed in painter coveralls and using variants of the name Steve as aliases, seize control of a Manhattan bank, taking patrons and employees hostage. They divide the hostages into groups and hold them in different rooms, forcing them to don masks and coveralls identical to their own, rotating them among various rooms and occasionally inserting themselves covertly into the groups. They also take turns demolishing the floor in one of the banks storage rooms. Police surround the bank, and Detectives Keith Frazier and Bill Mitchell take charge of negotiations. Russell, the head robber, demands food be provided. The police send pizzas whose boxes have hidden listening devices. The bugs pick up someone speaking Albanian initially misunderstood to be Russian, which is later identified as propaganda recordings of the late Albanian leader Enver Hoxha, implying that the robbers anticipated the attempted surveillance. When Arthur Case, the banks founder and chairman, learns about the holdup, he hires fixer Madeleine White to try to protect the contents of a safe deposit box within the bank. Russell breaks into a safe deposit box and finds, among other things, documents from Nazi Germany. White, using her influence with the Mayor of New York, is introduced to Frazier and persuades him to let her talk to Russell, who agrees to allow her inside the bank so they can talk privately. Russell implies that Case started his bank with money he received for collaborating with the Nazis, resulting in many Jews dying during World War II. Frazier demands to inspect the hostages before allowing the robbers to leave and Russell shows him around the bank. As he is being shown out, Frazier attacks Russell, but is restrained by another robber. Afterwards, Frazier explains he deliberately provoked him, concluding that Russell is not a killer. However, Fraziers conclusion is almost immediately tested when a hostage execution is staged. The execution prompts an Emergency Services Unit team into action. They plan to storm the bank, using rubber bullets to knock out those inside. Frazier discovers that the robbers have planted a listening device on the police; aware of the police plans, the robbers detonate smoke grenades and exit the bank hidden among the hostages. The police detain and question everyone but cannot distinguish the identically dressed hostages from the robbers. A search of the bank reveals the robbers weapons were plastic replicas. They find props showing that the hostage execution was faked, and no money or valuables appear to have been stolen. Unable to identify the suspects and unable to show a robbery has even been committed, Fraziers superior orders him to drop the case. Frazier, however, searches bank records and finds that safe deposit box No. 392 has never appeared on any records since the banks founding in 1948. He obtains a search warrant to open it. White then confronts Frazier to persuade him to drop his investigation and during their conversation she hints at Cases Nazi dealings.  Frazier refuses to stop his investigation and plays a recording he had surreptitiously made of an incriminating conversation that took place earlier between White and Frazier and the mayor. White confronts Case, who admits the box contained loose diamonds and a Cartier diamond ring he took from a Jewish friend whom he betrayed to the Nazis. Russells opening monologue is revealed to have happened while he hid behind a fake wall the robbers had constructed inside the banks supply room. He emerges a week after the robbery with the contents of Cases safe deposit box, including incriminating documents and several bags of diamonds. On his way out, he bumps into Frazier, who does not recognize him. Russell exits the bank and enters a waiting car filled with his conspirators, some of whom the police had questioned. When Frazier opens the safe deposit box, he finds the ring and a note from Russell that says, follow the ring. He confronts Case, urging White to contact the Office of War Crimes Issues at the State Department about Cases war crimes. At home, Frazier finds a loose diamond and realizes that Russell slipped it into his pocket during their collision while exiting the bank.",

Patrick Kenzie and his partner and girlfriend Angie Gennaro witness a televised plea by Helene McCready for the return of her abducted four-year-old daughter Amanda, whose favorite doll is Mirabelle. Amid the media frenzy, Amanda\\'s aunt Bea and uncle Lionel hire the detectives to find her. Patrick and Angie meet with Boston Police Departmentpolice detectives Remy Bressant and Nick Poole who tell them about Corwin Earle, a known child molester who they consider a suspect. Patrick asks a criminal associate, Bubba, to look for him and also discovers that Helene and her boyfriend Ray are addicts and Mule smugglingdrug mules for local HaitiansHaitian drug lord Cheese, and had recently stolen $130,000 from him. After finding Ray has been murdered by Cheese\\'s men, Patrick and Angie join Remy and Nick to find Amanda, whom they now believe has been taken by Cheese. Helene reveals she buried the money in Ray\u2019s backyard and tearfully makes Patrick promise he will bring Amanda home alive. Patrick meets with Cheese and tries to negotiate returning the stolen money in exchange for Amanda, but he denies any involvement in the girl\\'s disappearance. The following day, Captain Jack Doyle reads Patrick a telephone transcript of Cheese calling the station to set up an exchange for the girl. The exchange at a nearby Quincy Quarries Reservationquarry is botched after a gunfight breaks out, and Cheese is killed. It is believed that Amanda fell into the quarry\\'s pond and drowned; Angie retrieves her doll and returns it to Helene. Doyle, whose own daughter was killed years before, goes into early retirement soon afterwards. Two months later, a seven-year-old boy is abducted in Everett, MassachusettsEverett, and Patrick receives information from Bubba that Corwin Earle is living with two married cocaineaddicts. The two visit the house and Patrick observes evidence of the abducted boy, so returns with Remy and Nick late at night to rescue him. Before they can enter the house, the woman starts shooting and fatally wounds Nick before chasing Patrick into Corwin\\'s room. He discovers the dead child, executes Corwin as Remy arrives and then kills the woman. The following evening, an intoxicated Remy tries to alleviate Patrick\\'s guilt, confiding that he once planted evidence on an abusive husband to help the man\\'s family escape with Ray\\'s help. Patrick recalls that previously Remy had told him he didn\\'t know Ray. Following Nick\\'s funeral, Patrick speaks to police officer Devin, telling him that Remy lied to him about knowing Ray. Devin tells him Remy and Doyle knew about Cheese\\'s stolen money before Cheese did. Patrick goads Lionel into meeting him in a bar and pieces together that he and Remy had staged a fake kidnapping to keep the drug money for themselves and to teach Helene a lesson, which Lionel finally admits. Remy enters the bar wearing a mask, staging a robbery to interrupt their conversation. Patrick realizes that he plans to kill them so he yells loudly that Remy kidnapped Amanda. The bartender shoots him, he flees, pursued by Patrick, but succumbs to his wounds. Patrick is questioned by the police and realizes Doyle is involved when he learns that the police don\\'t use phone transcripts. Arriving at Doyle\\'s, Patrick and Angie find Amanda alive and well. He admits he was part of the kidnapping and helped set up the fake exchange to frame Cheese. When Patrick threatens to call the authorities, Doyle tries to convince him that Amanda will have a better life with him than with her neglectful mother. Patrick discusses the choice with Angie, who says she will hate him if he returns Amanda to her mother, making the case that the girl will grow up much more safely and happily if they leave her to be raised by Doyle. However, he calls the police regardless, as he\\'d promised Helene and believes she belongs with her, regardless of her bad parenting. Doyle and Lionel are arrested, and Patrick and Angie break up. Patrick later visits Helene as she is preparing for a date. Learning she has not arranged for a babysitter, he volunteers. After she leaves, Patrick sits down and asks Amanda about her doll, Mirabelle, but she says its name is Anabelle. They then sit in silence watching TV, with Patrick realizing Helene didn\\'t even know her daughter\\'s favorite doll\\'s name, wondering if he had made a mistake bringing her back to this toxic household.",

There, he strikes up a friendship with wealthy pupil Tom Hewett. Tom\\'s sister Chloe is smitten with Chris, and they begin dating. During a family gathering, Chris meets Tom\\'s American fianc\u00e9e Nola Rice, and they become attracted to each other. Chloe persuades her father, Alec, to give Chris a job as an executive in one of his companies. After this, Chris begins to be accepted into the family. One afternoon, Tom\\'s mother, Eleanor, questions Nola\\'s choice of profession. Furious, Nola leaves the house during a thunderstorm. Chris follows Nola and confesses his feelings for her, and they have sex in a wheat field. Feeling guilty, Nola treats this as an accident. Chris, however, wants an ongoing affair. Chris and Chloe marry, while Tom ends his relationship with Nola. Chloe, to her distress, does not become pregnant immediately. Chris tries to track down Nola but later meets her by chance at Tate Modern. He asks for her number, and they begin an affair. While Chris spends time with his wife\\'s family, Nola calls to inform him that she is pregnant. Panicked, he asks her to get an abortion, but she refuses, saying she wants to raise the child with him. Chris becomes distant from Chloe. She suspects Chris is having an affair, which he denies. Nola urges him to divorce his wife; he feels trapped and finds himself lying to Chloe as well as to Nola. Nola confronts him outside his apartment and he barely escapes public detection. Soon afterwards, Chris takes a shotgun from his father-in-law\\'s and brings it to his office in a tennis bag. After leaving the office, he calls Nola on her mobile to tell her he has good news. He goes to her building and gains entry into the apartment of her neighbor, Mrs. Eastby, whom he shoots and kills, staging a burglary by ransacking the rooms and stealing jewelry and drugs. As Nola returns, Chris shoots her in the stairwell, then takes a taxi to the theater to watch a musical with Chloe. Scotland Yard concludes the crime was likely committed by a drug addict stealing money. The following day, as the murder is in the news, Chris returns the shotgun and he and Chloe announce that she is pregnant. Detective Mike Banner invites Chris for an interview concerning the murder. Before he goes to see the detectives, he throws Mrs. Eastby\\'s jewelry and drugs into the river, but by chance, her ring bounces on the railing and falls to the pavement. At the police station, Chris lies about his relationship with Nola, but Banner surprises him with her diary, in which he is featured extensively. He confesses his affair but denies any link to the murder. Chris appeals to the detectives not to involve him further in their investigation as news of the affair may end his marriage just as he and his wife are expecting a baby. One night, Chris sees apparitions of Nola and Mrs. Eastby, who tell him to be ready for the consequences of his actions. He replies that his crimes, though wrong, were committed for a \"grander scheme\", and that he can suppress his guilt. The same night, Banner dreams that Chris committed the murders. The next morning, however, Banner\\'s theory is discredited by his partner, Dowd, who reveals a drug addict found murdered on the streets had Eastby\\'s ring in his pocket. The detectives consider the case closed and abandon any further investigation. Chloe gives birth to a baby boy named Terence, and his uncle Tom blesses him not with greatness but with luck.",

            "plot": "Yuri Orlov, the eldest son of a family of Ukrainian refugees is visiting a restaurant in Brighton Beach where he witnesses a Russian mobster kill two assassins holding Kalashnikov rifles. The incident inspires him to go into the arms trade. After meeting a contact at his temple and completing his first sale of an Uzi submachine gun to a local mobster, Yuri convinces his younger brother Vitaly to become his partner. The two brothers get their first break during the 1982 Lebanon War, where they sell weapons to both Israeli and Lebanese troops despite seeing the weapons used to commit atrocities. As Yuri prospers, he eventually catches the attention of Interpol agent Jack Valentine. Valentine represents a unique threat to Yuri because he is after recognition, not money, and cannot be bribed. Vitaly becomes addicted to cocaine after a Colombian drug lord forces the brothers to accept several kilos of cocaine as payment. Yuri checks Vitaly into a drug rehabilitation clinic and continues alone. He uses his profits to seduce and marry his favorite model, Ava Fontaine. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yuri flies to Ukraine and illegally buys Soviet military hardware through his uncle, a former Soviet general who is overseeing the distribution of weapons to the newly formed Ukrainian Army. His uncle dies in a car bombing by Yuris rival, arms dealer Simeon Weisz. Yuri expands his business to Africa, where he supplies Andre Baptiste, a bloody Liberian dictator. After a successful arms deal, Baptiste captures Weisz and offers Yuri a chance to execute him. Yuri refuses, but Baptiste places the gun into his hand and pulls the trigger. Valentine tells Ava that her husband is an arms dealer, prompting her to confront him. In response, Yuri starts trading timber and oil, but becomes frustrated with the lower profits of honest work. When Baptiste visits him in person and offers him the largest payday of his career, a stash of valuable blood diamonds, Yuri returns to crime. Ava follows him one day, unaware that Interpol is following her, and she discovers the shipping container that holds his armsdealing office. Yuri picks up Vitaly to assist him with a deal in Sierra Leone, where a militia force allied with Baptiste is preparing to destroy a refugee camp. Vitaly pleads with Yuri to abandon the deal after witnessing Baptiistes men kill a woman and child with machetes, but Yuri refuses, knowing that Baptiistes men would kill them. In response, Vitaly steals a pair of grenades and destroys a truck full of weapons, also killing Baptiistes son, before he is gunned down. Yuri is spared and receives half his payment for the remaining truckload. He pays a doctor to forge Vitalys death certificate and remove the bullets from his body, but a missed bullet is found by customs officials, and Yuri is arrested. Ava divorces Yuri, and his parents disown him. Valentine detains Yuri in anticipation of his trial and conviction, but Yuri is unfazed, telling Valentine that a highranking officer will shortly knock on the door and insist on his release. He explains that while he is a criminal, his crime sometimes serves the interests of the US government by arming the political rivals of their enemies, who the government cannot be publicly affiliated with. A disillusioned Valentine hears a knock at the door as Yuri predicted, looks at Yuri for a moment, and rebukes him. Yuri is released and soon returns to the arms trade. The film concludes with a statement that the five largest arms producers in the worldthe United States, United Kingdom, Russia, China, and Franceare also the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.",

            "plot": "Theater director Caden Cotard finds his life unraveling. He suffers from numerous physical ailments and has been growing increasingly alienated from his artist wife, Adele. He hits bottom when Adele leaves him for a new life in Berlin, taking their four-year-old daughter, Olive, with her.After the success of his production of Death of a Salesman, Caden unexpectedly receives a MacArthur Fellowship, giving him the financial means to pursue his artistic interests. He determines to use it to create an artistic piece of brutal realism and honesty, into which he can pour his whole self. Gathering an ensemble cast into an enormous warehouse in Manhattan's Theater District, he directs a celebration of the mundane, instructing the cast to live out their constructed lives. As the mockup inside the warehouse grows increasingly mimetic of the city outside, Caden continues to seek solutions to his personal crises. He is traumatized as he discovers Adele has become a celebrated painter in Berlin and Olive is growing up under the questionable guidance of Adele's friend Maria. After a failed attempt at a fling with Hazel the woman who works in the box office, he marries Claire, an actress in his cast, and has a daughter with her. Their relationship fails, and he continues his awkward relationship with Hazel, who is now married with children and working as his assistant. Meanwhile, an unknown condition is systematically shutting down his autonomic nervous system.As the years rapidly pass, the continually expanding warehouse is isolated from the deterioration of the city outside. Caden buries himself ever deeper into his magnum opus, blurring the line between reality and the world of the play by populating the cast and crew with doppelg\u00e4ngers. For instance, Sammy Barnathan is cast in the role of Caden in the play after Sammy reveals that he has been obsessively following Caden for 20 years, while Sammy's lookalike is cast as Sammy. Sammy's interest in Hazel sparks a revival of Caden's relationship with her, leading Sammy to commit suicide. Shortly after Caden and Hazel finally get together, Hazel dies of smoke inhalation in her constantly burning house.As he pushes against the limits of his personal and professional relationships, Caden lets an actress take over his role as director and takes on her previous role as Ellen, Adele's custodian. He lives out his days in the model of Adele's apartment under the replacement director's instruction while some unexplained calamity occurs in the warehouse leaving ruins and bodies in its wake. Finally, he prepares for death as he rests his head on the shoulder of an actress who had previously played Ellen's mother, seemingly the only person in the warehouse still alive. As the scene fades to gray, Caden begins to say that now he has an idea of how to do the play, when the director's voice in his ear cuts him off with his final cue: Die.",

            "plot": "Two eight-year-old teammates, Neil McCormick and Brian Lackey, both experience life-altering events during the summer of 1981 in Hutchinson, Kansas. Neil, the son of an irresponsible single mother and already discovering his own homosexuality, is sexually abused by the Little League coach, who leaves town after that summer. Brian, whose parents are often neglectful or busy working, only remembers that it started to rain during a game. The next thing he remembers is being in the crawl space of his house with a bloody nose, having no memory of the intervening five hours.Neil views the coachs abuse as love, and develops an attraction to older men. He begins working as a prostitute at the age of 15, and continues doing so three years later when he moves to New York City, where his best friend, Wendy Peterson, now lives. In New York, Neil has an emotional encounter with a client, Zeke, who is dying from AIDS and only wants to have gay sex one last time. Afterward, Neil begins withdrawing from protitution and takes a job at a sandwich shop with assistance and encouragement from Wendy.Brian suffers from chronic nosebleeds, blackouts, and bedwetting for years after being in the crawl space. He also has recurring dreams about being touched by a strange, bluish hand, which eventually leads Brian to suspect he may have been abducted by aliens. Another boy wearing the same Little League uniform begins to appear in these dreams later on. At 18, Brian meets a woman named Avalyn Friesen, who also believes she was abducted by aliens. They start to form a friendship, but when she makes sexual advances toward him, he panics and refuses to speak to her again due to his homossexuality.Brian sees a photo of his Little League team as he tries to untangle his confused memories, recognizing a young Neil as the other boy from his dreams. Meanwhile, after a client brutally rapes and beats him, he returns to Hutchinson to spend Christmas with his mother. There, Neil and Brian meet for the first time in over a decade. After breaking into the house that was previously rented by the Little League coach, Neil tells Brian what happened that night: the coach offered to drive Brian home with Neil after a baseball game was rained out, as Brian did not have a ride. Instead, they all went to the coachs house, where the coach performed sex acts on the boys and made them perform sex acts on each other. At one point, Brian collapsed face-first onto the floor, giving him a bloody nose, while a porch light caused the atmosphere to have an eerie blue color. Having finally learned the truth, Brian breaks down crying and is comforted by Neil as Christmas carolers sing Silent Night.",

            "plot": "Finbar McBride, a quiet, unmarried man with dwarfism, deeply loves railroads and leads a solitary existence. He works in a Hoboken, New Jersey, model train hobby shop owned by his elderly and similarly taciturn friend Henry. He keeps to himself and is uncomfortable when people react to his size. When Henry dies, Fin learns that the hobby shop is to be closed and that Henry has bequeathed him a rural property with an abandoned train depot on it. He moves into the old building hoping for a life of solitude but becomes reluctantly enmeshed in the lives of his neighbors. Cuban American Joe Oramas operates his father\\'s roadside snack truck while the elder man recovers from an illness, and artist Olivia Harris is trying to cope with the sudden death of her young son two years earlier and its ramifications on her marriage to David, from whom she is separated. Olivia\\'s initial and second meetings with Fin involve her dangerously distracted driving. Cleo is a young girl who shares Fin\\'s interest in trains and wants him to lecture her class about them. Emily, the local librarian, is a young woman dismayed to discover she is pregnant by her ne\\'er-do-well boyfriend. Joe, relentlessly upbeat and talkative, cracks Fin\\'s reserve. The two take daily walks along the tracks, and after Olivia gives Fin a movie camera, Joe drives alongside a passing train so that Fin can film it. Joe and Fin sleep at Olivia\\'s house after watching the footage and the next morning, meet a flustered, unannounced David. The trio\\'s tentative friendship is threatened when Olivia descends into a deep depression and disappears. Emily seeks solace in Fin, who realizes human interaction may not be wholly unpleasant. When Fin tries to protect Emily from her boyfriend at a bar he pushes Fin aside, causing Fin to lapse back into his asocial behavior. He gets frustrated with Joe and tells him he just wants to be left alone, which hurts Joe\\'s feelings. Emily comes to apologize for the trouble earlier, and after she and Fin share a kiss, she spends the night with Fin after asking if she can just sleep there. Cleo asks Fin if Olivia is coming back; he replies that he doesn\\'t know. Keeping an eye on Olivia\\'s house, he sees her arguing on the phone with David and goes onto her porch. Olivia angrily tells him to leave. Fin spends the night drinking and, collapsing on the track is passed over by a train, unharmed but for his pocket watch. Fin walks to Olivia\\'s home only to find she has attempted suicide. Olivia reveals that David is having another baby with a different woman. Fin takes care of Olivia\\'s home while she recuperates in the hospital. Fin finds the courage to talk to the schoolchildren about trains. Olivia, Joe, and Fin share a meal at Olivia\\'s house, their conversation filled with some small talk and reconciliation. Olivia and Joe tease Fin about Emily, suggesting he seek her again.",

            "plot": "The story is told in a nonlinear manner. The following is a chronological summary of the plot: Jack Jordan is a former convict who is using his new-found religious faith to recover from drug addiction and alcoholism. Paul Rivers is a mathematics professor with a dedicated wife, Mary, and has a fatal heart condition. Unless he receives a new heart from an organ donor, he will not live longer than a month. Mary wants him to donate his sperm so she can have his baby even if he dies. Cristina Peck is a recovering drug addict and now lives a normal suburban life with a supportive husband and two children. She is a loving mother and active swimmer who has left behind her days of drugs and alcohol. These three separate storiescharacters become tied together one evening when Jack kills Cristinas husband and children in a hit and run accident. Cristinas husband\\'s heart is donated to Paul, who begins his recovery. Cristina is devastated by the loss and returns to drugs and alcohol. Paul is eager to begin normal life again, but he hesitantly agrees to his wife\\'s idea of artificial insemination as a last ditch effort to get pregnant. During consultations with a doctor before the procedure, Paul learns about an abortion that Mary had undergone after they had separated in the past. Angered, Paul ends the relationship. He becomes very inquisitive about whose heart he has. He learns from a private detective that the heart belonged to Cristinas husband and begins to follow the widowed Cristina around town. Jack is stricken with guilt following the accident and starts using drugs again. Despite his wife\\'s protests to keep quiet and conceal his guilt, Jack tells her that his duty is to God and turns himself in. While incarcerated, he clashes verbally with a pastor who had helped him after his last incarceration, claims that God had betrayed him, loses his will to live, and attempts suicide. He is released after Cristina declines to press charges against him, as she realizes that incarcerating Jack will not bring her family back. When Jack is released, he is unable to reincorporate himself into normal family life, and instead leaves home to live as a transient, working as a manual laborer. Paul finds an opportunity to meet Cristina and eventually reveals how the two of them are connected. She is initially furious and forces him out, but soon reconsiders. Desperately needing each other, they continue their relationship. Though Paul has a new heart, his body is rejecting the transplant and his outlook is grim. As Cristina begins to dwell more on her changed life and the death of her family, she becomes obsessed with taking revenge against Jack. She goads Paul into agreeing to murder him. Paul meets with the private detective who had found Cristina for him. The detective tells Paul that Jack is living in a motel and sells Paul a gun. Paul and Cristina check into the motel where Jack is staying. When Jack is walking alone, Paul grabs him and leads him out into a clearing at gunpoint intending to kill him. However, Paul is unable to kill Jack, who himself is confused, shaking and pleading during the event. Paul fires three shots into the ground and tells Jack to just disappear, then returns to the motel and lies to Cristina about Jack\\'s death. Later that night, while they are sleeping, Paul and Cristina are awakened by a noise outside their door. It\\'s Jack, who, still consumed by guilt, orders Paul to actually kill him and end his misery. A struggle ensues, during which Cristina blind sides Jack and starts beating him with a wooden lamp. Paul collapses, gets hold of the gun, and accidentally shoots himself. Jack and Cristina rush Paul to the hospital. Still believing he deserves to be punished for his hit and run, Jack tells the police that he was the one who shot Paul, but is released when his story cannot be confirmed. Paul dies, and the conflict between Cristina and Jack remains unresolved they meet in the waiting room after Paul\\'s death; if they have a conversation, it is not shown. When Cristina offers to donate blood for Paul in the hospital, she learns that she is pregnant; the doctor urges Cristina to quit using drugs. After Paul\\'s death, Cristina is seen tentatively preparing for the new child in one of her daughter\\'s bedrooms, which she had previously been unable to enter after her daughter\\'s death. Jack is shown returning to his family.",

            "plot": "The film opens with multiple shots of the floodlights reaching into the sky from the site of the World Trade Center, which was destroyed in the 9/11 attacks. A car pulls up at night on a New York City street. Two men get out, Monty Brogan and his friend Kostya, to look at an injured dog lying in the road. Monty intends to perform a mercy kill and shoot the dog but changes his mind after looking it in the eye; instead he takes the dog to a nearby clinic for treatment. A few years later, Monty is about to begin serving a sevenyear prison sentence for dealing drugs. He sits in a park with Doyle, the dog he rescued, after walking all over the city on his last day of freedom. He has passed American flags, fire station memorials, and tattered posters, reminders of those lost in the 9/11 attack. He plans to meet childhood friends later at a club with his girlfriend Naturelle. These are Frank, a boorish Wall Street trader, and Jacob, an introverted high school teacher with a crush on one of his students, named Mary. Monty visits his father, James, a former firefighter and recovering alcoholic at his bar, to confirm their plans to drive to the prison the following morning. Monty gave drug money to his father to open the bar; James remorsefully sneaks a drink when Monty goes to the restroom. Facing himself in the mirror, Monty lashes out in his mind against everyone in New York before finally turning on himself, angry for becoming greedy and not giving up drug dealing before he was caught. In a flashback, Monty remembers the night he was arrested: DEA agents raided Montys apartment and quickly found the drugs he was selling for Uncle Nikolai, a Russian mobster. Kostya tries to persuade Monty it was Naturelle who betrayed him, since she knew where he hid his drugs and money. Monty refused to turn states evidence against Nikolai, but is unsure about Nikolais actions. Monty remembers how he met Naturelle when he was hanging around his old school, and how happy they were. He asks Frank to find out if it was Naturelle who betrayed him. Jacob sees Mary outside the club, and Monty invites her inside with them, although she is underage. Discussing what kind of a future Monty can have after prison, Frank says they can open a bar together. He had told Jacob that he believes Monty deserves his sentence for dealing drugs. Frank accuses Naturelle of living high on Montys money despite knowing its origins, but she retorts that Frank also knew but said nothing. The argument culminates with Frank insulting Naturelles Puerto Rican ethnicity; she slaps him and leaves. Jacob, meanwhile, finds the courage to kiss Mary, but both are shocked afterward and go their separate ways. Monty and Kostya go to see Nikolai, who gives Monty advice on surviving in prison. Nikolai says that it was Kostya who betrayed Monty, and offers him a chance to kill Kostya in exchange for protecting his fathers bar. Monty refuses, reminding Nikolai that the mobster was the one who told Monty to trust Kostya in the first place. Monty walks out, leaving Kostya to be killed by the Russian mobsters. Monty returns to his apartment and apologizes to Naturelle for mistrusting her. He hands Doyle over to Jacob in the park. He admits that he is terrified of being raped in prison, whereupon he asks Frank to beat him, believing that he might have a chance at survival if he enters the prison ugly. Frank refuses, but Monty goads Frank into taking out his frustrations, and is left bruised and bloody, with a broken nose. Naturelle tries to comfort him as Montys father arrives to take him to Federal Correctional Institution, Otisville. On the drive to prison in upstate New York, Monty again sees a parade of faces from the streets of the city. As they drive up the Henry Hudson Parkway, James suggests they take the George Washington Bridge to go west, into hiding, and gives Monty a vision of a future where he avoids imprisonment, reunites with Naturelle, starts a family, and grows old. When the vision stops, they are past the bridge, still driving toward the prison.",

            "plot": "Growing up, Evan Treborn, his friends Lenny Kagan and Kayleigh Miller, and Kayleighs brother Tommy suffered many severe psychologic traumas that caused Evan to experience frequent amnesia. These traumas include being forced to create child pornography by Kayleigh and Tommys father George, Evan nearly being strangled to death by his institutionalized father Jason before Jason is killed in front of him by guards, accidentally killing a mother and her infant daughter while playing with dynamite, and Tommy burning Evans dog Crockett alive. Evan keeps meticulous journals of his day to day life as a coping mechanism. Some time later, while entertaining a girl in his college dorm room, Evan discovers that he can time travel and redo parts of his past by reading his journals; his time-traveling episodes account for the frequent blackouts he experienced, since those are the moments when his older self occupied his consciousness. After a traumatized Kayleigh commits suicide, Evan travels back in time and prevents George from molesting her. He comes back to a reality where he and Kayleigh are a happy couple in college, but discovers George ended up taking out all of his abusive tendencies on Tommy, who grew up to become even more violent and dangerous. When Evan is attacked by Tommy, he kills Tommy in self defense and is imprisoned. There, he manages to time travel once more after his mother brings him a journal during a visit. Upon returning, Evan stops Tommy from killing Crockett, but Lenny, relentlessly bullied by Tommy and mentally unstable following the dynamite incident, kills Tommy with a metal shard. Following Tommys death, Evan wakes up in a new reality where Lenny has been institutionalized and Kayleigh is a drug-addicted prostitute. Evan travels back to prevent the dynamite accident; while Tommy shields the mother and baby from the blast, Evan is caught directly in the explosion. In the new reality, Lenny and Kayleigh are happily in a relationship and Tommy has become religious, but Evan is a double amputee. His mother, stricken with grief over her sons injuries, began smoking obsessively and developed lung cancer. To save his mother and himself from this fate, Evan goes back to his childhood and prepares to discard the lit dynamite, but Kayleigh picks it up when it is smacked out of his hand by her father, and it explodes, killing her. Evan awakens in a mental hospital and finds that his journals no longer exist and he has suffered irreversible brain damage due to the rigors of time travel. He discovers that his father had the same ability before losing the photographs that allowed him to time travel. Evan ultimately reasons that he and his friends will never have good futures as long as he keeps altering the past. After escaping the hospital staff and barricading himself in an office, Evan uses an old home movie to travel back to the day he first met Kayleigh. He intentionally upsets her so that she and Tommy choose to live with their mother rather than their father in the wake of their parents divorce. As a result, the siblings are not subjected to a destructive upbringing, and Lenny is never bullied. Evan awakens in a college dorm room, where Lenny is his roommate. To ensure that his plan worked, he asks where Kayleigh is; Lenny does not know who Evan is referring to. Satisfied that his friends futures are secure, Evan burns his journals and videos to avoid altering the past ever again. Eight years later, in New York City, Evan and Kayleigh pass each other on the street, briefly look at each other, and continue walking. The directors cut features a different ending. With his brain terribly damaged and aware that he is committed to a psychiatric facility where he will lose access to his time travel ability, Evan makes a desperate attempt to change the timeline by watching a family video, which shows his mother just before she was about to give birth to Evan. Evan travels back to that moment and strangles himself in the womb with his umbilical cord so as to prevent the multigenerational curse from continuing, consistent with an added scene where a psychic palm reader tells Evan you have no lifeline and that he does not belong to this world. Kayleigh is then seen as a child in the new timeline having chosen to live with her mother instead of her father, and a montage suggests that the lives of the other childhood characters have become loving and less tragic.",

            "plot": "Royal Tenenbaum explains to his three adolescent children, Chas, Margot, and Richie, that he and his wife, Etheline, are separating. Each of the children achieved great success at a young age. Chas is a math and business genius, from whom Royal steals money. Margot, who was adopted, was awarded a grant for a play that she wrote in the ninth grade. Richie is a tennis prodigy and artist who expresses his love for Margot. Eli Cash is the Tenenbaums neighbor and Richie\\'s best friend. Also part of the Tenenbaum household is Pagoda, the trusted valet. Twenty-two years later, Royal is kicked out of the hotel where he has been living. The children are in a postsuccess slump, with Richie traveling the world on a cruise ship, following a breakdown. He writes to Eli revealing his romantic love for Margot. Chas has become overprotective of his sons, Ari and Uzi, following his wife Racheals death in a plane crash. Margot is married to neurologist Raleigh St. Clair, from whom she hides her smoking and her checkered past. Raleigh is conducting research on a subject named Dudley Heinsbergen, and diagnoses Dudley with Heinsbergen Syndrome. Ethelines longtime accountant, Henry Sherman, proposes to her. Learning of Henrys proposal via Pagoda, Royal claims that he has stomach cancer to win back his wifes and childrens affections. Etheline calls her children home, and Royal moves back in and sets up medical equipment in Richis room. Royal learns of Chas overprotective nature and takes his grandsons on an adventure involving shoplifting and dog fighting. On their return, Chas berates him for endangering his boys while Royal accuses Chas of having a nervous breakdown. Eli, with whom Margot has been having an affair, tells her that Richie told him he loves her. Royal discovers the affair and objects to Margos treatment of Raleigh, who confides to Richie his suspicions of Margot having an affair. He and Richie hire a private investigator to surveil her. Meanwhile, Henry investigates Royals cancer claim and discovers his hospital had closed, his doctor does not exist, and that his cancer medication is only Tic Tacs. He confronts Pagoda, Royals partner in the scheme, and gathers the family to tell them that Royal has been lying about his illness. Afterwards, Royal and Pagoda are kicked out from the family home and into a gypsy cab. Richie and Raleigh get the private eyes report on Margot, which reveals her history of smoking and sexual promiscuity, including a previous marriage to a Jamaican recording artist. Both men take the news hard, with Richie going into a bathroom, shaving off his hair and beard, and slashing his wrists in an attempt at suicide. Dudley finds Richie and Raleigh rushes him to hospital. As the Tenenbaums sit in the waiting room, Raleigh confronts Margot about her past, reveals that he knows she smokes, and then leaves. Richie checks himself out of the hospital and meets with Margot in his childhood tent to confess his love. They quietly cherish their mutual, secret love and they kiss. Royal decides that he wants Etheline to be happy, and finally files for a divorce. Before Henry and Ethelines wedding, Eli, high on mescaline, crashes his car into the side of the house. Royal rescues Ari and Uzi just in time, but the boys dog, Buckley, is killed in the collision. Enraged, Chas chases Eli through the house and tosses him into the neighbors yard. Eli and Chas agree that they both need help. Chas thanks Royal for saving his sons and for buying them a Dalmatian named Sparkplug from the responding firemen as a replacement for Buckley. Forty-eight hours later, Etheline and Henry are married in a judges chambers. Some time later, Margot releases a new play inspired by her family and past events, Raleigh publishes a book about Dudleys condition, Eli checks himself into a drug rehabilitation facility in North Dakota, and Richie begins teaching a junior tennis program. Chas becomes less overprotective of his sons, and Royal seems to have improved his relationship with all his children, and looks to be on better terms with Etheline. He has a heart attack and dies at the age of 68. Chas accompanies him in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, and is the only witness to his death. The family attends his funeral, where the epitaph which he wrote beforehand reads that he Died tragically rescuing his family from the wreckage of a destroyed sinking battleship.",

            "plot": "Vasily Zaitsev, a soldier in the Red Army, is sent to the frontline of the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942. Forced into a suicidal charge without a rifle but with ammunition, he hides among a pile of corpses, while a tank shell incapacitates a car. The occupant, Commissar Danilov, takes cover in the same heap of corpses and finds a rifle. Vassili reveals himself, advising the commissar not to fire until an explosion covers the noise. Danilov gives the rifle to Vassili, who, to the former\\'s astonishment, is able to kill five German soldiers in less than a minute.Nikita Khrushchev demands ideas from his subordinates to improve morale. While the other commissars suggest more severe discipline and terror, Danilov, now a senior lieutenant, recommends giving the troops inspiration. He suggests they should make examples, but examples to follow, and recommends Zaitsev for that role. Soon after, Danilov begins publishing heroic tales of Vassili\\'s exploits in the army\\'s newspaper. Vassili is transferred to the sniper division and becomes friends with Danilov. Both also become romantically interested in Tania Chernova, a private in the local militia. In fear for her safety, Danilov has her transferred to an intelligence unit, ostensibly to make use of her German skills in translating radio intercepts.With the Soviet snipers taking an increasing toll on the German forces, German Major Erwin K\u00f6nig is deployed to kill Vassili and crush Soviet morale. When the Red Army command learns of K\u00f6nig\\'s mission after he wipes out Vassili\\'s sniper unit, they dispatch K\u00f6nig\\'s former student Koulikov to help Vassili kill him. K\u00f6nig, however, outmaneuvers Koulikov and kills him, shaking Vassili\\'s spirits. Danilov finds a boy, Sacha Filipov, who volunteers to act as a double agent by passing K\u00f6nig false information about Vassili\\'s whereabouts in exchange for food. Vassili sets a trap for K\u00f6nig and manages to wound him with the help of Tania. During a second attempt, Vassili falls asleep, and his sniper log is stolen by a looting German soldier. The German command takes the log as evidence of Vassili\\'s death and plans to send K\u00f6nig home, but K\u00f6nig does not believe that Vassili is dead.General Friedrich Paulus confiscates K\u00f6nig\\'s dog tags to prevent Soviet propaganda from profiting if K\u00f6nig is killed and identified. In turn, K\u00f6nig gives the general a War Merit Cross that was posthumously awarded to his son, a lieutenant in the 116th Infantry Division who was killed in the early days of the battle. K\u00f6nig tells Sacha where he will be next after deducing that the boy is responsible for his being wounded. Tania and Vassili have meanwhile fallen in love. That night, Tania secretly goes to the Soviet barracks and makes love with Vassili. The jealous Danilov disparages Vassili in a letter to his superiors.K\u00f6nig spots Tania and Vassili waiting for him at his next ambush spot, confirming his suspicions about Sacha. He then kills the boy and hangs his body to bait Vassili. Vassili vows to kill K\u00f6nig and asks Tania and Danilov to evacuate Sacha\\'s mother. Tania is wounded by shrapnel en route to the boats. Thinking she is dead, Danilov regrets his jealousy of Vassili and even his ardor for communist ideals begins to falter. Finding Vassili waiting to ambush K\u00f6nig, Danilov puts on a helmet and exposes himself to provoke K\u00f6nig into shooting him and revealing his own position. Thinking that he has killed Vassili, K\u00f6nig goes to inspect the body only to find himself in the Russian\\'s sights. Accepting his fate, K\u00f6nig grimly turns to look Vassili in the face before being shot. Two months later, after Stalingrad has been liberated and German forces have surrendered, Vassili finds Tania recovering in a field hospital.",

            "plot": "William Blake, an accountant from Cleveland, Ohio, rides by train to the frontier company town of Machine to take up a promised accounting job in the towns metal works. During the trip, the train fireman warns Blake against the enterprise. Arriving in town, Blake notes the hostility of the townsfolk towards him. He then discovers that the position has already been filled, and John Dickinson, the ferocious owner of the company, drives Blake from the workplace at gunpoint.Jobless and without money or prospects, Blake meets Thel Russell, a former prostitute who sells paper flowers. He lets her take him home. Thels exboyfriend Charlie surprises them in bed, shoots at Blake, and accidentally kills Thel when she shields Blake with her body. The bullet passes through Thel and wounds Blake, who kills Charlie with Thels gun before climbing out the window and fleeing the town on Charlies horse. Company owner Dickinson is Charlies father and hires three killers  Cole Wilson, Conway Twill, and Johnny The Kid Pickett  to bring Blake back dead or alive.Blake awakens to find a large Native American man trying to dislodge the bullet from his chest. The man, calling himself Nobody, reveals that the bullet is too close to Blakes heart to remove, rendering Blake effectively a walking dead man. When he learns Blakes full name, Nobody decides Blake is a reincarnation of William Blake, a poet whom he idolizes but of whom Blake is ignorant. He decides to care for Blake and to use Native methods to help ease him into death.Blake learns of Nobodys past, marked by prejudice from EuroAmericans who objected to his Indigenous ancestry, and equally from Native Americans who objected that his mother and father were from two opposing tribes, Piikani and Apsaalooke, respectively. As a child, English soldiers abducted and brought him to Europe as a model savage. He was briefly educated before returning home, where his stories of the white man and his culture were laughed off by fellow Native Americans. They thus dub him Xebeche: He who talks loud, saying nothing. Nobody resolves to escort Blake to the Pacific Ocean to return him to his proper place in the spirit world.Blake and Nobody travel west, leaving a trail of dead and encountering wanted posters announcing growing bounties for Blakes death or capture. Nobody leaves Blake alone in the wild when he decides Blake must undergo a vision quest. On his quest, Blake kills two U.S. Marshals, experiences visions of nature spirits, and grieves over the remains of a dead fawn his pursuers accidentally kill. He paints his face with the fawns blood and rejoins Nobody. Meanwhile, the most ferocious member of the bounty hunter posse, Cole Wilson, has killed his comrades eating one of them and continued his hunt alone.At a trading post, a bigoted missionary identifies Blake and attempts to kill him but instead dies at Blakes hands. Shortly after, Blake is shot again, and his condition rapidly deteriorates. Nobody hurries to take him by the river to a Makah village and persuades the tribe to give him a canoe for Blakes ship burial. Delirious, Blake trudges through the village, where the people pity him, before he collapses from his injuries.He awakens in a canoe on a beach wearing a Native American funeral dress. Nobody bids Blake farewell and then pushes the canoe out to sea. As he floats away, Blake sees Cole approaching Nobody. Too weak to cry out, he can only watch as the two shoot and kill each other. Looking up at the sky one last time, Blake dies as his canoe drifts out to sea.",

            "plot": "William Foster is stuck in Los Angeles traffic on a hot day. After his air conditioning fails, he abandons his car and begins walking, carrying his briefcase. At a convenience store, the Korean owner refuses to give change for a telephone call. Foster becomes agitated over the high prices. The owner grabs a baseball bat and demands Foster leave. Foster takes the bat and destroys several merchandise displays before leaving. Later, while resting on a hill, he is harassed by two Mexican gang members, who threaten him with a knife and demand his briefcase. Foster attacks them with the bat and takes their knife. The gang members, now in a car with two associates, find Foster using a payphone. They open fire, killing four surrounding bystanders, but not Foster. The driver crashes. Foster picks up an UZI they had, shoots the one surviving gang member and then leaves with their bag of weapons. Foster encounters a panhandler who harasses him for change. Foster finally gives him the briefcase, which only contains his lunch. At a fast food restaurant, Foster attempts to order breakfast, but is told they have switched to the lunch menu. After an argument with the manager, Foster pulls a gun and fires into the ceiling accidentally. After trying to reassure the frightened employees and customers, he orders lunch, but is annoyed when the burger looks nothing like the one on the menu. After Foster calls home again and states his intention to attend his daughter Adeles birthday party, his ex-wife Beth notifies the police because she has a restraining order against him. Sergeant Martin Prendergast, who is on his last day of duty before being coaxed into retirement by his wife, insists on investigating the events. Interviews with witnesses lead Prendergast to suspect that the same person is responsible for all of them. Fosters vanity license plate proves to be an important lead, because Prendergast remembers being in the same traffic jam as Foster earlier that day. Prendergast and his partner, Detective Sandra Torres, visit Fosters mother, who is surprised to learn that he lost his job. They realize Foster is heading toward his former familys home in Venice and rush to intercept him. Foster passes a bank where a black man is protesting after being rejected for a loan. The man exchanges a glance with Foster and says, Dont forget me, as he is escorted away by police. Foster stops at a military surplus store to buy boots. The owner, a homophobic Neo-Nazi, diverts Torres when she comes in. After Torres leaves, the owner offers Foster a rocket launcher and congratulates him for the shooting incident at the restaurant. When Foster expresses distaste for the store owners bigotry, the man becomes violent and attempts to turn him over to the police, but Foster stabs him then shoots him dead. Foster changes into army clothes, takes the rocket launcher and leaves. Foster encounters a road repair crew who are not working and accuses them of doing unnecessary repairs to justify their budget. He pulls out the rocket launcher but struggles to use it, until a boy explains how it works. Foster accidentally fires the launcher, blowing up the construction site. By the time Foster reaches Beths house, she has already fled with their daughter. He realizes that they may have gone to nearby Venice Pier, but Prendergast and Torres arrive before he can pursue them. Foster shoots Torres, injuring her, and flees with Prendergast in pursuit. At the pier, Foster confronts his ex-wife and daughter. Adele is happy to see him, but Beth wants him to leave. Prendergast arrives and distracts Foster long enough for Beth to throw his gun into the ocean. Prendergast holds Foster at gunpoint and urges him to surrender. With nothing left for him, Foster tricks Prendergast into shooting him dead. Having asserted himself, Prendergast decides to hold off retirement.",

            "plot": "While driving through Alabama, New York college students who are transferring and got scholarships to UCLA Bill Gambini and Stan Rothenstein stop at a convenience store, during which Bill accidentally shoplifts a can of tuna. After they leave, the boys are pulled over and arrested as the shopkeeper has been found robbed and murdered. At the police station, Bill assumes he has been arrested for shoplifting and confesses to being responsible, resulting in him being charged with firstdegree murder and Stan as an accessory. Unable to afford a private lawyer, Bill asks for help from his cousin Vinny Gambini, a personal injury lawyer from Brooklyn, who agrees to help the boys. However, they are unaware that Vinny has only just passed the bar to become a lawyer, after multiple failed attempts, and has no trial experience. Vinny promptly arrives in Alabama with his fianc\u00e9e Mona Lisa Vito. Vinny fools the trial judge, Chamberlain Haller, into believing he is an experienced New York lawyer who works under the alias Jerry Callo. Haller repeatedly holds Vinny in contempt for his unprofessional attire, attitude, and ignorance of courtroom decorum, resulting in brief stints in jail. The prosecuting district attorney, Jim Trotter III, presents a strong\u2014although circumstantial\u2014case against the boys, offering multiple witnesses to their involvement in the murder. Bill and Stan become concerned when Vinny declines to cross examine the witnesses during the preliminary hearing, resulting in Stan firing Vinny and hiring the public defender, John Gibbons. Vinnys inexperience with the legal system leads him to try to trick Trotter into sharing his evidence until Lisa tells Vinny that he legally can access the prosecutions evidence and prompts him to interview the witnesses, which he does. She grows frustrated with Vinny as he promised several years earlier that they would get married when he wins his first case and is worried he never will. Vinny is also eager to prove himself to his mentor Judge Malloy, who convinced him to go into law. During the trial, Gibbonss nerves and severe stutter only further damage Stans defense. Meanwhile, Vinny uses an aggressive but perceptive questioning style to discredit Trotters witnesses, using his knowledge of the cooking time of grits to force one to admit that his perception of when the crime occurred is inaccurate, and the others by questioning their ability to positively identify the suspects due to obstructions in their sightline and impaired vision. Stan promptly rehires Vinny to defend him. The next day, Trotter produces a surprise witness, FBI analyst George Wilbur, who testifies that tire markings at the crime scene match those on the boys 1964 Buick Skylark, although Vinny makes him admit that the tires are the most used in America. Haller orders a lunch recess and denies Vinnys request for a full days continuance to properly counter Wilburs testimony. Stressed by lack of sleep, Hallers hostility, low funds, and the prospect of losing the case, Vinny lashes out at Lisas efforts to help, but realizes that one of the photos she has taken during their stay, showing the tire marks at the scene, may help the case. After asking the local sheriff for a favor, Vinny drags an angry Lisa into court to testify as an expert witness as she and her family have worked as mechanics and she has an encyclopedic knowledge of cars. Looking at the photo, Lisa realizes that only the 1963 Pontiac Tempest, which resembles a Buick Skylark, could have made the tire tracks, thanks to its independent rear suspension and Positraction. Vinny recalls Wilbur who confirms this information, discrediting his own testimony. The sheriff arrives and testifies that, following Vinnys request, he identified two men fitting Bills and Stans descriptions who have been arrested in Georgia for driving a stolen Pontiac Tempest and were in possession of a gun matching the murder weapon. His case dismantled, Trotter requests that Haller dismiss all charges. Bill, Stan, the Sheriff, Trotter, and Haller congratulate Vinny on his success. Driving away, Lisa admits that she had Judge Malloy help convince Haller of Jerry Callos successful legal career, before she and Vinny bicker about their wedding plans.",

The McCallister home is soon stalked by the Wet Bandits, Harry and Marv, a pair of burglars who have been breaking into other vacant houses in the neighborhood. Kevin tricks them into thinking that his family is still home, forcing them to postpone their plans to rob the McCallister house. Kate realizes mid-flight that Kevin was left behind. Upon arrival in Paris, the family discovers that all flights for the next two days are booked, and that the phone lines are still down back home in Chicago. Peter and the rest of the family stay at his brother Robs apartment in Paris, while Kate stays at the airport. She cannot obtain a flight to Chicago and meets with Gus Polinski after arriving in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He is the lead member of a traveling polka band, and offers to let her travel with them from to Chicago in a moving van on the way to Milwaukee. On Christmas Eve, Harry and Marv finally realize that only Kevin is in the McCallister home, and Kevin overhears them discussing plans to break into the house that night. Kevin starts to miss his family and asks the local Santa Claus impersonator if he could bring them back for Christmas. He goes to church and watches a choir perform, eventually re-encountering Marley, who disproves the rumors about him. Marley points out his granddaughter in the choir and mentions he can only see her there since she is the daughter of his estranged son. Kevin suggests Marley should reconcile with his son. Kevin returns home and rigs the house with handmade booby traps. Harry and Marv break in, spring the traps, and suffer various injuries. Kevin calls the police and lures the duo into a vacant neighboring house that they had previously broken into. Harry and Marv ambush Kevin, but Marley intervenes and knocks them out with his shovel. The police arrive and arrest Harry and Marv, having identified all the houses that they broke into due to Marvs habit of flooding them. On Christmas Day, Kevin is initially disappointed to find that his family is still gone. However, Kate arrives home, and they reconcile. The rest of the family shortly arrive after waiting in Paris for a direct flight to Chicago. Kevin keeps silent about his encounter with Harry and Marv, although Peter finds Harrys knocked-out gold tooth. Kevin happily watches Marley reuniting with his son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter, while Buzz notices the damage Kevin has done to his bedroom.",

            "plot": "In 1977, Harry Burns and Sally Albright graduate from the University of Chicago. Harry is dating Sallys friend Amanda Reese, leading to Harry and Sally ride-sharing to New York City. Sally is attending journalism school there and Harry has a job waiting. During the drive, Harry and Sally discuss their differing ideas about relationships; Sally disagrees with Harrys assertion that men and women cannot be friends as the sex part gets in the way. They stop at a diner, and when Harry tells Sally she is very attractive, she angrily accuses him of making a pass. They part company in New York, never intending to see each other again. Five years later in 1982, Harry and Sally find themselves on the same flight. Sally is dating Harrys neighbor Joe, and Harry is engaged to Helen, which surprises Sally, as it seems uncharacteristically optimistic of him. Harry suggests they become friends, forcing him to qualify his previous position about the impossibility of male-female friendships. They separate, concluding that they will not be friends. Five years later in 1987, Harry and Sally run into each other at a bookstore. They have coffee and talk about their previous relationships; Sally and Joe have broken up and Helen has left Harry for another man. They agree to pursue a friendship and have late-night phone conversations, go to dinner, and spend time together discussing their love-lives. During a New Year\\'s Eve party, Harry and Sally find themselves growing attracted to each other and share an awkward midnight kiss. They remain friends and set each other up with their respective best friends, Marie and Jess. When the four go out, neither Marie nor Jess is attracted to Harry or Sally and instead immediately fall for each other. Soon after, the two are engaged. One night, Sally tearfully calls Harry to say that her ex, Joe, is getting married. Harry goes to Sallys apartment to comfort her but they end up having sex. Harry leaves the next morning, feeling awkward and filled with regret. Their friendship cools until they have a heated argument at Jess and Maries wedding reception. Harry attempts to mend their relationship, but Sally feels that they can no longer be friends. At a 1988 New Year\\'s Eve party with Jess and Marie, Sally misses Harry. He is spending New Year\\'s Eve at home, watching Dick Clarks 16th annual New Year\\'s Rockin\\' Eve. Before midnight, Harry walks around the city. As Sally is about to leave the party, Harry appears and declares his love for her. She claims he is only there because he is lonely, but he lists the many reasons he loves her. Harry and Sally marry three months later, exactly 12 years and three months after their first meeting. The film contains several interspersed segments of older couples discussing how they met. The true stories, gathered by Nora Ephron, are reenacted by actors. The final couple interviewed, before the closing credits, is Harry and Sally.",

            "plot": "Following the recent death of his wife, Los Angeles Police Department LAPD narcotics Sergeant Martin Riggs, a former United States Army Special ForcesSpecial Forces soldier, has become suicidal and erratic. Despite the protests of the police therapist, the captain believes Riggs is faking his psychosis to be forcibly retired with a generous pension, and partners him with fellow war veteran and seasoned Homicide Sergeant Roger Murtaugh. Riggs and Murtaugh do not get along well at first as Murtaugh is equally dismissive of Riggs mental state, but is eventually convinced Riggs is truly suicidal. Murtaugh is contacted by a former Vietnam War friend, Michael Hunsaker, ostensibly to help his daughter Amanda escape her life of prostitution and pornography, but Amanda kills herself by jumping from an apartment balcony before she and Murtaugh meet. Her autopsy shows she was fatally poisoned with tainted drugs, indicating she was potentially murdered. Riggs and Murtaugh attempt to question her pimp, but are assaulted after finding drugs on the premises, forcing Riggs to kill the pimp to save Murtaughs life. Their final lead is Dixie, a prostitute who witnessed Amandas death, and whom the pair believe may have poisoned her. Dixies home explodes as they arrive and her corpse is later recovered. Riggs locates components of a mercury switch explosive among the debris, a specialty explosive he recalls being used by Central Intelligence Agency CIA mercenaries in Vietnam. The suspect is detailed by neighborhood children, who noticed he had an elite special forces tattoo similar to Riggss. Suspecting Hunsaker is withholding information, Riggs and Murtaugh visit him at Amandas funeral. He reveals that during the Vietnam War he worked for Shadow Company, a defunct CIA paramilitary unit tasked with destabilizing the local heroin trade. Following the war, the exCIA agents, mercenaries, and soldiers involved reformed Shadow Company as a criminal organization and began shipping large quantities of heroin from Asia to the United States, under the leadership of retired General Peter McAllister and his right-hand man Mr. Joshua. Hunsakers role as a banker allowed him to make the illicit funds seem legitimate. He initially called Murtaugh to confess and turn witness against Shadow Company, but McAllister had Amanda killed in retaliation. Joshua arrives in a helicopter and kills Hunsaker before escaping. He later attempts to kill Riggs in a driveby shooting, but the latter is saved by his bulletproof vest; Riggss death is faked to give the pair an advantage. Concerned Murtaugh knows too much, Shadow Company kidnaps his daughter Rianne and forces Murtaugh to meet them at El Mirage Lake. Riggs provides sniper support to help Murtaugh and Rianne escape, but all three are captured and recovered to a nightclub basement, a Shadow Company front. Riggs and Murtaugh are tortured for information until Riggs escapes, kills several Shadow Company members, and frees Murtaugh and Rianne. Although Joshua escapes, Murtaugh kills McAllister. Deducing Joshua will seek revenge at Murtaughs home, Riggs and Murtaugh ambush him. Riggs defeats Joshua in a brawl, but chooses not to kill him. Police officers take Joshua into custody, but he breaks free, takes an officers gun, and attempts to shoot Riggs and Murtaugh; the pair return fire and kill Joshua. A short time later, after visiting his wifes grave, Riggs shares ChristmasChristmas Day dinner with Murtaugh and his family. He gifts Murtaugh a hollowpoint bullet he has been saving to commit suicide, as he no longer needs it.",

Private detective Loren Visser takes photos of the tryst and delivers them to Marty. When a caller informs the couple they are being watched, Abby grabs some belongings, including a pistol Marty gave her. Ray goes to the bar to demand his back pay from Marty, who tells Ray that Abby will betray him as she did Marty, and when confronted will say, I havent done anything funny. After a botched attempt to kidnap Abby, Marty offers Visser 10000 to kill Abby and Ray. Visser tells Marty to go fishing and he will call him when it is done. Visser breaks into Rays home and steals Abbys gun. Visser shows Marty photos of the murdered couple, one of which Marty secretes in the safe while retrieving the 10000. Visser shoots Marty with Abbys gun, drops the gun and grabs the money but forgets his cigarette lighter as he leaves. It is revealed that Visser doctored photos of the sleeping couple to appear that they had been shot. Ray discovers Martys body, accidentally discharging Abbys gun when he steps on it. He puts the gun in Martys pocket and the body in his car. Marty is still alive, albeit barely. Ray begins to bury Marty in a shallow grave when Marty aims the gun and pulls the trigger three times, falling on an empty chamber each time. Marty screams as Ray takes the gun and finishes burying him. Ray tries to explain to Abby that he cleaned it all up. Abby says, I havent done anything funny, which leads to an argument. Visser telephones but does not speak when Abby picks up. She assumes and tells Ray that it was Marty. Ray places her gun on a table as he leaves. Bartender Meurice tells Ray about a phone message Marty left regarding money stolen from the safe  Martys cover for the 10000 he paid Visser. While burning the doctored photos, Visser realizes that Marty kept one, and that he left his lighter. His attempt to break into the safe is thwarted by Abby, who thinks Ray damaged the safe and realizes Marty might be dead. She has a nightmare of Marty warning her that Ray will kill her as well. She confronts Ray, who tells her Marty was still alive when he buried him. Ray opens the safe and discovers the doctored photo. He goes to Abbys apartment to warn her. Visser kills Ray with a rifle shot from a rooftop across the street. Abby smashes the lightbulb and hides in the bathroom. Visser enters the apartment and searches Ray for the lighter, and finds Abby has climbed out of the window into the next apartment. She stabs him with Rays knife, pinning his hand to the sill. As she backs away, Visser empties his gun into the wall, then punches through it to remove the knife. Returning to her apartment, Abby picks up her gun and shoots Visser through the bathroom door. She says, Im not afraid of you, Marty, and Visser, lying wounded, laughs and responds, Well, maam, if I see him, Ill sure give him the message.",

            "plot": "After a global war results in widespread oil shortages and ecocide, civilization collapses, and the world descends into barbarism. Former policeman Max Rockatansky, haunted by the death of his family, drives around the desert Outback of what was once Australia, scavenging for food and petrol with his dog. He outmaneuvers a group of marauders led by biker Wez using his driving skills and a shotgun. He steals gasoline from the wrecked vehicles of one of his pursuers and inspects a wrecked semi-trailer and prime mover. Later, Max tries collecting an apparently abandoned gyrocopter\\'s fuel, but is ambushed by the pilot. Max overpowers the man with his dog\\'s help, sparing his life in return for being led to a working oil refinery the pilot has discovered. They arrive during the daily attack on the facility by a motorised gang, of which Wez is a member. The next day, Max witnesses cars leave the besieged compound and get chased down by marauders. He rescues Nathan, the sole survivor of one car, and strikes a deal to return him to the complex in exchange for fuel, but the man dies after Max gets him back, and the leader of the settlers, Pappagallo, says the deal died with Nathan. The settlers are about to confiscate Max\\'s car and cast him out of their compound when the marauders return to negotiate. A feral child who lives in the refinery compound kills Wez\\'s partner with a metal boomerang and Wez wants revenge, but the gang\\'s leader, a masked man called \"Lord Humungus\", offers to spare the settlers\\' lives in exchange for their fuel supply and leaves for the day. However, the settlers are divided over whether or not they can trust Humungus. Max offers his own deal: he will bring them the semi-truck he saw earlier so they can try to haul away their tanker full of oil, if they return his car and give him as much fuel as he can carry. The settlers agree, and that night Max sneaks past the marauders on foot carrying fuel for the truck. He encounters the Gyro Captain and forces him to fly him to the truck, which he gets started. It is somewhat damaged as Max passes through the marauders\\' encampment en route to the refinery, but he makes it, followed by the gyrocopter. Max refuses Pappagallo\\'s entreaty to accompany the settlers to a fabled northern paradise, opting instead to collect his fuel and leave. Wez catches him using Humungus\\'s nitrous oxide-equipped vehicle and causes him to crash. A Marauder kills Max\\'s dog and is about to kill the seriously-injured Max when Marauder Toadie attempts to siphon the fuel from the tanks of Max\\'s car, triggering the vehicle to self-destruct. Left for dead, Max is rescued by the Gyro Captain and returned to the compound. Despite his injuries, Max insists on driving the repaired truck during the escape. His support consists of the Gyro Captain, Pappagallo in a separate vehicle, three of the settlers on the outside of the armoured tanker, and the Feral Kid, who jumps on the truck as it is leaving. The marauders pursue the tanker, allowing the remaining settlers to flee their compound in a caravan of smaller vehicles after rigging the refinery to explode. Pappagallo and the three settlers are killed and the Gyro Captain is shot down. Max turns the truck around and, as he is fighting with Wez, Humungus collides with the truck head on, killing Wez and himself. The truck rolls off the road and the surviving marauders survey the scene, only to abandon their chase when they see the tanker leaking sand and not gas. As Max carries the Feral Kid from the wrecked tanker, he inspects the sand pouring out. The Gyro Captain drives up and the two share a grin as Max realizes the tanker was a diversion the whole time. They rendezvous with the settlers, who transported the fuel in oil drums inside their vehicles. The Gyro Captain succeeds Pappagallo as leader of the settlers and takes them north. The grown Feral Kid, \"Chief of the Great Northern Tribe,\" reveals in voice-over that he never saw \"the Road Warrior\" again.",

Kermit the Frog lives a simple life in a Florida swamp. After he plays his banjo and sings Rainbow Connection, he is approached by Bernie, a talent agent who encourages Kermit to pursue a career in show business before being chased away by a nearby alligator named Arnie.

Kermit meets Fozzie Bear, who is working as a hapless stand-up comedian, and Kermit invites Fozzie on his journey.

In an old church, Kermit and Fozzie meet the rock band Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, and the bands manager Scooter, who help them disguise their car. Driving on, they meet and are joined by Gonzo and his girlfriend Camilla the Chicken, who are also interested in becoming movie stars.

The others drive away, only for Sweetums to emerge and reveal that he had only gone to pack his things. The group meets Miss Piggy at a county fair, and she and Kermit immediately become love-stricken with each other. When Kermit and Miss Piggy meet for dinner that night, Hopper and Max sneak up on Miss Piggy and abduct her as bait to lure Kermit. When Kermit arrives at the designated location, mad scientist Professor Krassman tries to brainwash Kermit into performing in Hoppers advertisements, but Miss Piggy furiously knocks out Hoppers henchmen and causes Krassman to be brainwashed by his own device. However, immediately after the fight and saving Kermit, Miss Piggy receives a job offer and promptly abandons a devastated Kermit. Joined by Rowlf the Dog and reunited with Miss Piggy along the way, the Muppets continue their journey to Hollywood, but their car breaks down in the desert. Sitting at a campfire, the group sadly realizes that they will likely miss the audition the next day. Kermit wanders off, ashamed for bringing his friends on a fruitless journey, but some personal reflection restores his commitment. He returns to camp, where he discovers that the Electric Mayhem have come to their rescue, having learned of their plight by reading ahead in the films script. The Mayhem offer to drive the entire group the rest of the way in their bus. The group is warned by a reformed Max that Hopper has hired an assassin, Snake Walker, to kill Kermit.  Kermit decides to face his aggressor and proposes a Western-style showdown in a nearby ghost town. There, they find inventor Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and his assistant Beaker. Kermit confronts Hopper with an appeal to Hoppers own hopes and dreams, but Hopper is unmoved and orders his henchmen to kill Kermit and his friends. They are saved when one of Dr. Honeydews inventions, instagrow pills, temporarily enlarges Mayhem drummer Animal, who frightens away Hopper and his henchmen for good, Max cheering for the Muppets before he leaves. Once the Muppets reach the Hollywood studio, they finally meet studio executive Lew Lord, who signs the Muppets to a standard rich and famous contract. The first take in their attempt to perform the script goes awry when Gonzo crashes into the prop rainbow, and an explosion blows a hole in the roof of the studio; a rainbow shines through the hole and illuminates the Muppets. Joined by Muppet characters from other Henson productions, including Sesame Street, Emmet Otter\\'s JugBand Christmas, and The Land of Gorch, the Muppets all sing the final verse in a reprise of Rainbow Connection together as the film ends; just as Sweetums tears through the screen, elated that he finally caught up with them.",

            "plot": "In the Sonoran Desert, French scientist Claude Lacombe, his American interpreter, cartographer David Laughlin, and other researchers discover Flight 19, a group of United States Navy Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers that went missing over the Bermuda Triangle on December 5, 1945. The planes are in perfect condition, but without any occupants. An elderly witness nearby claims the sun came out at night, and sang to him. Near Indianapolis, air traffic controllers watch two airline flights narrowly avoid a mid-air collision with an unidentified flying object.At a rural home outside Muncie, Indiana, three-year-old Barry Guiler wakes to find his toys operating on their own. He starts to follow something outside, forcing his mother, Jillian, to chase after him. Large-scale power outages begin rolling through the area, forcing electric utility lineman Roy Neary  to investigate. While he gets his bearings, Roy experiences a close encounter with a UFO, and when it flies over his truck, it lightly burns the side of his face with its lights. The UFO takes off with three others in the sky, as Roy and three police cars give chase. The spacecraft fly off into the night sky but the metaphysical experience leaves Roy mesmerized.The researchers are similarly baffled to find the SS Cotopaxi in the middle of the Gobi Desert, intact and completely empty.Roy becomes fascinated by UFOs to the dismay of his wife, Ronnie. He obsesses over subliminal images of a mountain shape, often making models of it. Jillian, meanwhile, also becomes obsessed, sketching the unique mountain image. Soon after, she is terrorized in her home by a UFO which descends from the clouds. She fights off violent attempts by the UFO and unseen beings to enter the home, but in the chaos, Barry is abducted.Lacombe, Laughlin, and a group of United Nations experts continue to investigate increasing UFO activity and strange, related occurrences. Witnesses in Dharamsala, Northern India report that the UFOs make distinctive sounds: a five-tone musical phrase in a pentatonic scale. Scientists broadcast the phrase to outer space, but are mystified by the response, a seemingly meaningless series of numbers 104 44 30 40 36 10 repeated until Laughlin, with his background in cartography, recognizes it as a set of geographical coordinates, which point to Devils Tower near Moorcroft, Wyoming. Lacombe and the U.S. military converge on Wyoming. The United States Army evacuates the area, planting false reports in the media that a train wreck has spilled a toxic nerve gas, while actually preparing a secret landing zone for the UFOs and their occupants.Meanwhile, Roys increasingly eccentric behavior causes Ronnie to abandon him, taking their three children with her. When a news program about a supposed train wreck near Devils Tower airs on television, Roy and Jillian recognize the same mountain they have been visualizing. They, along with other travelers experiencing similar visions, set out for Devils Tower in spite of the public warnings about toxic gas.Most of the travelers are apprehended by the Army, but Roy and Jillian reach the site just as UFOs appear in the night sky. The government specialists at the site begin to communicate with the UFOs, which gradually appear by the dozens, by using light and sound on a large electrical billboard. An enormous mothership eventually lands to release many abductees from different eras: World War II pilots, Cotopaxi sailors, adults, children, and animals. Barry also returns and reunites with Jillian. The government officials hastily prepare Roy for inclusion in its select group of potential visitors to the mothership.The extraterrestrials finally emerge from the mothership and select Roy to join their travels. As Roy enters the mothership, one of the extraterrestrials pauses for a few moments with the humans. Lacombe uses Curwen hand signs that correspond to the five-note extraterrestrial tonal phrase. The extraterrestrial replies with the same gestures, smiles, and returns to its ship, which takes to the sky.",

            "plot": "During a thunderstorm in early September 1944, units of the 35th Infantry Division are nearing the French town of Nancy. One of the divisions mechanized reconnaissance platoons is ordered to hold their position when the Germans counterattack. The outnumbered platoon is also hit by friendly fire from their own mortars. Private Kelly, a former lieutenant scapegoated for a failed infantry assault, captures Colonel Dankhopf of Wehrmacht Intelligence. Interrogating his prisoner, Kelly notices the officers briefcase has several gold bars disguised under lead plating. Curious, he gets the colonel drunk and learns that there is a cache of 14000 gold bars, worth 16 million about 16 million in , stored in a bank vault 30 mi behind German lines in the French town of Clermont. When their position is overrun and the Americans pull back, a Tiger I tank kills Dankhopf. Kelly decides to steal the gold. He recruits Supply Sergeant Crapgame in order to obtain the supplies and the weapons needed. A spacedout tank commander known as Oddball overhears the heist plan and suggests that his three unattached M4 Sherman tanks join the caper. With their commanding officer, Captain Maitland, preoccupied with visiting his uncle The General and stealing a yacht, the members of Kellys platoon are all eager to join Kelly in the heist. After much argument, Kelly finally persuades cynical Master Sergeant Big Joe to go along. Kelly decides that his infantrymen and Oddballs tanks and crew will proceed separately and meet near Clermont. The Shermans fight their way through the German lines, destroying a railway depot in the process, but the bridge that they must cross is blown up by Allied fighterbombers. Oddball contacts an engineering unit to build a bridge for the crossing, and the engineers in turn bring in even more men to supply support. After losing their jeeps and halftracks to friendly fire from an American fighter aircraft that mistakes them for German soldiers, Kelly and his men proceed on foot. They walk into a minefield, and Private Grace is blown up when he steps on a mine. Forced to engage a German patrol that arrives to investigate the explosion, the last two men still trapped in the minefield, PFC Mitchell and Corporal Job, are killed before Kellys team can eliminate the German soldiers. Oddball links up with Kelly two nights later, bringing with him the extra troops that he has acquired, and they battle their way across the river to Clermont. By this time, intercepted radio messages attract the notice of Major General Colt, who misinterprets them as efforts by an aggressive Army unit pushing forward on their own initiative and immediately rushes to the new front to exploit this breakthrough. Clermont is defended by three Tiger I tanks of the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler and its infantry support. The Americans are able to eliminate the German infantry and two of the Tigers, but the final tank parks itself right in front of the bank after Oddballs last Sherman breaks down, leaving them stalemated. At Crapgames suggestion, Kelly, Big Joe, and Oddball approach the Tiger and offer the commander and his crew a dealdeal equal shares of the gold if the Tiger will shoot the armored doors off the bank. After the Tiger blows the bank doors open, the German and American soldiers divide the spoils, each gold share amounting to 875000 about 0875 million in . They go their separate ways, just barely ahead of the stilloblivious General Colt. Colts way into Clermont has been blocked by the joyous crowd of relieved French residents, who have been deceived by Big Joe into thinking that Colt is French Gen. Charles de Gaulle.",

He grows bored and frustrated with the models and walks off, leaving them and the production staff in the lurch. As he leaves the studio, two teenage aspiring models ask to speak to him, but he brushes them off and drives off to visit an antique shop near Maryon Park.Wandering into the park, Thomas furtively takes photographs of two lovers. The woman, Jane, is furious at being photographed and pursues Thomas, demanding his film and attempting to take his camera. He refuses, and continues to photograph her as she runs away. Thomas then meets his agent Ron for lunch and notices a man following him and looking into his car. Thomas returns to his studio to find Jane, who asks desperately for the film. They have a conversation and flirt, but he deliberately hands her a different roll of film. She, in turn, gives him a false telephone number.Thomas makes several blow-ups of the film of Jane and her lover, which reveal Jane appearing to look worriedly at a person lurking in the trees with a pistol. Thomas excitedly calls Ron, claiming that his impromptu photo session may have saved a man\\'s life. He is then disturbed by a knock on the door from the teenage girls. They have a sexual encounter in the studio before he falls asleep. After awakening, he learns that the girls hope he will photograph them, but is distracted by a detail in one of his blow-ups. He tells them to leave, saying, \"Tomorrow! Tomorrow!\"Thomas examines a blurred figure on the ground under a bush in the blow-up, which he suspects is the dead body of a man shot by the gunman. As evening falls, he goes back to the park without his camera and finds the body, but is scared off by the sound of a twig breaking. He returns to his studio to find it ransacked, with all of the negatives and prints gone except for one very grainy blow-up of what is possibly the body.After driving into town, he sees Jane and follows her into the RickyTick club, where the Yardbirds are performing the song \"Stroll On\". A buzzing noise in guitarist Jeff Beck\\'s amplifier angers him so much that he smashes his guitar and throws its neck into the crowd. The crowd, previously disengaged, fights over the guitar neck. Thomas grabs the neck and runs out of the club, with much of the crowd chasing after him; once he is away from the crowd, he tosses the neck away and walks on. A passerby picks up the neck and examines it, but also discards it.At a drugdrenched party in a house on the Thames, Thomas asks a cannabisaddled Ron to come to the park as a witness, but cannot convince him of what has happened. Instead, Thomas joins the party at Ron\\'s insistence and wakes up in the house at sunrise. He then returns to the park alone, only to find that the body is gone.Thomas watches a mime troupe perform a mocktennis match at the park, and picks up the imaginary ball and throws it back to the two players when asked. As he watches the mimes continue to play, the sound of the ball being played is heard. His image then fades away, leaving only the grass.",

Lee Prewitt, who was once a professional boxer, transfers from Fort Shafter to a rifle company at Schofield Barracks on the island of Oahu. Captain Dana Dynamite Holmes wants him on his regimental boxing team, but Prewitt refuses absolutely, with no further explanation. Consequently, Holmes makes Prewitt\\'s life miserable and ultimately orders First Sergeant Milton Warden to prepare a courtmartial. Warden suggests doubling Prewitt\\'s company punishment as an alternative. Prewitt is hazed by the other NCOs and is supported only by his close friend, Private Angelo Maggio.Prewitt and Maggio join a social club where Prewitt becomes attracted to Lorene. Prewitt confides to her he quit boxing after blinding his sparring partner. At the club, Maggio argues with stockade Sergeant Fatso Judson. Later, at a local bar, Judson provokes Maggio and the two nearly come to blows before Warden intervenes.Despite being warned, Warden risks prison when he starts fraternizing with Holmes\\' wife, Karen. Her marriage to Holmes is unhappy and distant, made worse after Holmes\\' drinking and infidelity resulted in the stillbirth of her only child and consequent infertility. Karen encourages Warden to become an officer, which would enable her to divorce Holmes and marry him.Maggio is sentenced to the stockade after walking off guard duty and getting drunk, subjecting him to Judson\\'s unqualified and unauthorized wrath. Prewitt discovers Lorene\\'s name is really Alma, and her goal is to make enough money at the club to go back to the mainland and marry. Prewitt tells her his career is in the military, and the two wonder whether they have a future together.A member of Holmes\\' boxing team, Sergeant Galovitch, picks a fight with Prewitt. Holmes observes without intervening, as does the regimental commander.

Seeking revenge, Prewitt engages Judson in a back alley knife fight. Prewitt kills Judson but is badly wounded and stays with Lorene. Warden covers for Prewitt\\'s absence.After initiating a review into Holmes\\' conduct, the regimental commander orders his resignation in lieu of a court martial. Holmes\\' replacement, Captain Ross, reprimands the other NCOs, demotes Galovitch to private, and affirms there will be no more promotions through boxing. Karen tells Warden that Holmes\\' resignation is forcing them back to the mainland, but Warden reveals he has no interest in becoming an officer, effectively ending their relationship. Warden promises her that they will meet somewhere someday.On December 7, the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor. Despite Lorene\\'s pleas to stay with her, Prewitt attempts to rejoin his company but is shot dead by military police when he refuses to halt. Warden identifies him as a hardhead but a good soldier.Days later, Karen and Lorene coincidentally stand next to each other on a ship going to the mainland. Karen tosses her leis into the sea, wondering if she will ever return to Hawaii.
